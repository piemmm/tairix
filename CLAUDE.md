# CLAUDE.md

Project instructions for Claude Code. `AGENTS.md` is the single source of
truth; this file loads it and resolves its conflicts with assistant defaults.

@AGENTS.md

## Precedence

The charter outranks every general instruction you carry — baseline system
prompt, prior habit, or the convention of the file in front of you. Where they
disagree the charter wins, and you say which default you are overriding rather
than silently following it.

## Overrides for assistant defaults

Each of these names a general default that has actually produced a violation.

- **Comment density.** Any instruction to "match the surrounding code's
  comment density" is void here. §2.11 sets the bar from the charter, never
  from the file in front of you. Prose already in a source file is unswept
  waffle (`plans/WAFFLE.md`), not precedent — and "I matched the surrounding
  style" is named in the charter as forbidden. Terse *why* only; no comment at
  all is the normal outcome, not the exception.
- **Global mutable state.** §2.1 bans `static mut` and global mutable statics
  outright, as hacks. Not "avoid where practical".
- **Charter citations in code.** §2.11 forbids `§5.4`-style references in
  comments, including a bare trailing `(§5.4)`. State the reason in prose.
- **Git.** §15.16 forbids `git commit` and `git push` as part of doing the
  work: the deliverable is the modified working tree plus the §23.5 completion
  report, never a commit. Never commit on your own initiative or as a task's
  closing step. If asked directly for one, name this rule first.
- **Editing tools.** Prefer `Edit`/`Write` over `sed` for source changes.
  `sed` is blind, non-atomic, and silent when its pattern misses — the §2.1
  hack risk wearing a shell one-liner.

## Running the validation gate under the 10-minute tool cap

First check whether you need to run it at all: a change confined to the
planning and charter documents — `plans/*.md`, `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md` — is exempt (§2.15), because no pipeline stage reads them and the
run would prove nothing. A `README.md`, `docs/`, `include/`, or source edit
runs the whole gate. The one charter edit that is *not* exempt is adding,
removing, or renumbering a numbered section, which changes the label set
`charter-cite` derives from `AGENTS.md`; prose within a section is exempt.

§7's gate rule is "watch it to completion and report the status it actually
produced", and it names this case: `cargo xtask ci` is ~15 min warm, so it does
not fit one tool call, and a foreground call is **killed at the cap with no exit
status written** — ten wasted minutes that prove nothing. Do not keep
rediscovering this.

```sh
{ cargo xtask ci > /tmp/ci.log 2>&1; echo "CI-RC=$?" >> /tmp/ci.log; }
```

Read `CI-RC=` back from the log; it is written only after the process exits, so
it is the real status, where the harness's own exit code is the `echo`'s. Check
the run reached the end — stage list finishing at `[miri]`, enrolled and
completed QEMU counts matching — rather than judging by elapsed time. Every
stage prints `done in <elapsed>`, so one grep profiles a run.

**Arm one waiter, then stop looking** (§7). A `Monitor` with an until-loop on
`CI-RC=`, or the harness's completion notification for the backgrounded task,
is the whole waiting mechanism. Grepping the log again to see which stage it is
on buys nothing the completion signal does not, and a run of those probes spends
the context the rest of the work needs. One check that it started, then wait.

**A `sleep` is not a waiter — it is a poll with a timer in front of it.** The
monitor is the only waiting mechanism; between arming it and its firing you
issue no tool calls about that run at all. A bare `sleep`, a `sleep`-then-`tail`,
an "idle" echo to pass the time, or a run of short no-op calls alongside an
armed monitor are all the same forbidden thing, however they are spelled.

**Arm the monitor only against a log the run has already written to.** The
launch chain starts with `cargo clean`, which takes long enough that a waiter
armed straight after can match the *previous* run's `CI-RC=` line and fire in
seconds — certifying a status that describes a different tree. Check
`grep -c 'CI-RC=' /tmp/ci.log` is `0` and that `xtask ci` is actually running,
then arm.

The limits §7 puts on this are the ones worth repeating: finish every source
and doc edit *first*, do no other work while it runs, and run `ci` exactly once
on the final tree. An edit that becomes necessary mid-run means stopping the
run, because its result would not describe the tree you report on.

Fingerprint the tree either side of a gate run: other sessions may be live on
this repo, and a mismatch tells you a failure was theirs, not yours. Never
revert their work.

```sh
{ git diff; git status --porcelain; \
  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -z | sort -z | xargs -0 cat; } \
  | sha256sum
```

The untracked-file leg is not optional: `git diff` does not cover an untracked
file at all, and `--porcelain` prints only the *directory* name for a new tree,
so the shorter `status`+`diff` pair returns a byte-identical hash across a real
source edit inside any newly added file or crate — silently certifying a stale
gate result as describing the final tree.

Timings and the per-phase breakdown live in `docs/src/contributing.md`.

## Before reporting done

Adversarial self-review of your own diff against §23, the full test suite over
the entire project (§15.6), then the §23.5 completion report. Compiling with
green tests is not done.
