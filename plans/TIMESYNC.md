# TIMESYNC.md — Time synchronisation: the NTP client, RTC drivers, and the clock's provenance

Staged build plan for how a TAIRiX machine learns what time it is. **Binding
under `AGENTS.md`** (read it first, especially §2, §4, §5, §17, §19, §21,
§24, §26). It consumes the seams `plans/NETWORK.md`, `plans/DNS.md`, and
`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` establish and never contradicts them; where they
touch, those plans' decisions stand. `abi-v1` is not frozen, so the ABI and
config additions here are ordinary pre-release changes (§2.13).

The motivating hardware fact: a Raspberry Pi 3/4 has **no RTC**, and the Pi 5's
is optional and battery-backed. The motivating software fact: nothing in this
workspace calls `wall_time_set` outside tests, so every boot starts at
`WallTimeState::Unset` — the desktop clock renders its unset label, the Date &
Time app deliberately shows empty fields, and audit-log hash chains, ARXFS
`Time64` metadata, and certificate validity all rest on a clock a human has to
set by hand.

## 0. Scope and decisions (binding)

- **Two independent sources, one arbiter.** An RTC (when the machine has one)
  gives a time at boot with no network; NTP corrects and maintains it. The
  arbitration between them is the *provenance ladder* the wall clock already
  models (`WallTimeState`): `Unset` → `Firmware` (an RTC) → `Trusted` (a
  validated network sync) / `Adjusted` (a slew). A source never overwrites a
  reading of strictly better provenance, so an RTC read cannot clobber a
  network sync.
- **TAIRiX is an NTP *client*, not a server.** A stub SNTP/NTPv4 client
  (RFC 5905 §14) querying configured servers in unicast mode. An NTP server,
  broadcast/multicast/manycast modes, symmetric peering, Autokey, NTS, and a
  full clock-filter/selection/clustering algorithm are explicitly **not** in
  this plan (§2.3/§2.4). One server's validated sample disciplines the clock;
  a full peer-selection algorithm is a later increment if measurement shows it
  is needed.
- **Two crates, following the shape `dns` already set (§2.2).** The wire
  protocol lives with its siblings and the client that drives it is its own
  crate, exactly as `lib/net::dns` and `lib/resolver` divide:
  - **`lib/net::ntp`** — the pure, `no_std`, allocation-free RFC 5905 codec,
    every response-validation rule, the sample computation, the Kiss-o'-Death
    decode, and the poll/retransmit/backoff/server-rotation state machine.
    It sits beside `dhcp` and `dns` because it *is* a network wire protocol,
    and it reuses that crate's existing monotonic-deadline arithmetic
    (`timeutil`) rather than carrying a second copy.
  - **`lib/timesync`** — the userland client: the sync-decision policy of §2
    (which is clock policy, not NTP), driving the engine over an injected
    transport seam, with the freestanding socket glue behind a `program`
    feature so the host tests never pull the runtime (the `lib/resolver` /
    `lib/procinfo` split).

  Both are driven by injected monotonic time, an injected wall-clock reading,
  and **caller-supplied CSPRNG values** — neither generates randomness itself
  (the `lib/net::dhcp` / `tcp::conn` `iss` / `dns` precedent). Unit tests, the
  fuzz harness, and the live service all exercise the *same* engine.
- **Every packet on the wire is hostile (§26.4), and NTP is unauthenticated.**
  The codec is total over a fixed 48-byte header, bounded, fuzzed (§19.6), and
  fails closed: a malformed or implausible response is dropped whole and
  nothing partial is surfaced. Off-path spoofing is bounded by the RFC 5905
  §8 on-wire check — the response's origin timestamp must equal the exact
  CSPRNG 64-bit nonce the request carried in its transmit field — plus the
  plausibility window of §2. A mismatch is discarded, never accepted.
- **The decode never runs in the same address space as `CAP_TIME_SET`**
  (§19.5). See §4.
- **Event-driven and tickless (§2.23, §17.1).** The engine folds one
  `next_deadline()`; the service arms a single one-shot wait and calls
  `poll(now)` when it lapses and `on_response(now, bytes)` when a datagram
  arrives. There is no polling loop and no periodic tick.
- **64-bit time throughout (§21).** Every instant is `Time64`, every span
  `Duration64`. The NTP 1900-epoch timestamp wraps in 2036, so the NTP **era**
  is handled explicitly rather than assumed zero; tests cover pre-1970,
  post-2038, and the era boundary.
- **Automatic time-setting is enabled by default and the user can turn it
  off.** That switch is service enrolment, owned by the service manager, and
  is reachable from both a command line and the desktop (§6).
- **A machine always has somewhere to ask: three ordered server tiers, first
  non-empty wins outright (§3.1).** An operator's `time.servers` outranks a
  DHCP-supplied server, which outranks the built-in public-pool fallback. The
  tiers are never merged. A machine that asks nobody has no clock, so the
  default cannot be "no servers".

## 1. Target architecture (binding)

```
lib/net::ntp            pure protocol: codec, validation, politeness, retry
   ^                    (beside dhcp and dns; no sockets, no clock, no RNG)
   |
lib/timesync            the client: the sync-decision policy over an injected
   ^                    transport; freestanding glue behind `program`
   |
userland/system/timed   the service: reactor, sockets, DNS, wall_time_set
   |         \
   |          `-- lib/sandbox::timesync   the decode, in a capability-less worker
   |
lib/sysconfig           time.* keys in /System/Settings/Configuration/system.conf
lib/resolver            server names -> addresses

lib/abi/src/driver/rtc.rs   the RTC driver class + the shared BCD civil codec
   ^
drivers/rtc/<leaf>/         one crate per chip, matched by discovery
   ^
lib/i2c + drivers/bus/i2c/bcm2835/   the transfer path the I2C chips are reached through
```

- `timed` is a system service under its own service account (`timed`, uid 18),
  and the kernel derives its grant as `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` from the
  signed `AppInfo` at load. It holds `CAP_TIME_SET`, `CAP_NET`,
  `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`, `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, and `CAP_LOG_EMIT` — no endpoint bind,
  no raw or admin network authority, no general spawn.
  - It is an **enrolled** service, not part of PID 1's compiled-in startup
    floor: its SUM1 unit metadata travels in its own signed `AppInfo` and the
    image's vendor enrolment layer names it (TS-5b).
  - It needs no readiness gate: a query it cannot send simply fails, and the
    engine's bounded backoff paces the retry, so an interface that appears
    late costs nothing. That is why its unit metadata declares no `requires` —
    a board with no NIC still needs its clock service to read its RTC.
- An RTC driver is an ordinary `drivers/` module: matched by its
  hardware-tree `compatible` key through `lib/devmatch`, autoloaded by
  `devmgr` under `CAP_DRV_LOAD`, granted only the resources its matched node
  requested (§18.3). It sets the clock as `Firmware` and holds no network
  authority.
- The reactor shape is `userland/net/netstack/src/run.rs`'s, unchanged:
  `waitset_create` / `waitset_ctl(Port)` / `waitset_wait(set, timeout_ns)`
  with `timeout_ns` folded from the engine's `next_deadline()`.

## 2. The sync-decision policy

The question "should I sync *now*?" is a pure function of the wall clock's
current reading, the monotonic uptime, and a persisted last-seen record. It is
the engine's core and is host-tested as a matrix.

A reading is **implausible** when it falls outside the plausibility window:
before `tairix_abi::time::RELEASE_EPOCH` (a fixed, documented release-epoch
constant — no TAIRiX build can legitimately be running before the release it
was built from) or more than `PLAUSIBLE_FUTURE_YEARS` (100) ahead of it. The
window is a **fixed validation bound** (§24.4), never a capacity, and never
widened to make a case pass.

Decision order, first match wins:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Clock `Unset` | Sync as soon as `NetworkUp` is satisfied |
| Reading implausible (pre-`RELEASE_EPOCH`, or ≥ 100 years hence) | Sync immediately |
| Reading minus the persisted last-seen instant exceeds `STALE_BOOT_GAP` (5 days) | Sync immediately |
| Otherwise (clock set and plausible) | **No boot sync.** Refresh once `REFRESH_UPTIME` of uptime has elapsed, then on that cadence |

`REFRESH_UPTIME` defaults to one day and is configurable (§3); the point of
gating it on *uptime* rather than wall time is that a machine which reboots
often must not re-query on every boot — an RTC's reading is trusted until
there is a reason to doubt it, which is exactly the row above it.

The persisted record is `/System/Settings/Time/state`: a small fail-closed
document holding the last successful sync instant and the last-seen instant,
rewritten on each successful sync. `/System/Settings` is one of the two
writable paths under `/System` (§16.2) and is already mounted
`nosuid,nodev,noexec`. A missing or corrupt record resolves to "no last-seen
instant" — which makes the stale-boot row simply not fire, never a guess
(§5.4).

**Discipline.** The kernel wall clock is set-and-project — it has no frequency
or gradual-slew primitive — so a correction is always applied as a single
`wall_time_set`. A genuine frequency-correcting slew (an `adjtimex` analogue,
which would need a kernel primitive that does not exist) is out of scope here.

**Provenance describes the source, never the size of the change.** A validated
sample always records `WallTimeState::Trusted`, because the new reading comes
wholly from the network time source — whether it established an `Unset` clock,
replaced a `Firmware` one, or refreshed an earlier sync. `Adjusted` is
deliberately *not* used by `timed`: the ABI defines it as a previously-set time
corrected after the fact, so that the offset is no longer its original
source's, which describes a manual step (the Date & Time application) rather
than a source replacing its own value.

The service still classifies a correction larger than `STEP_THRESHOLD` as a
*step* rather than a refinement, but that is an **audit** distinction, not a
provenance one: a large step can move certificate validity and reorder how a
reader interprets the log, so it is worth its own event. Nothing else in the
service touches the clock.

## 3. Politeness — not overloading NTP servers

Encoded as engine policy, never as a sleep loop (§2.1) and never as
retry-until-it-works. The reference is RFC 8633 (NTP BCP).

- **A hard minimum poll interval floor.** Steady state is a multi-minute
  cadence; the floor is a fixed bound the configuration cannot lower.
- **One request in flight per server**, and the configured list is *rotated*
  rather than one server being hammered.
- **Bounded exponential backoff with CSPRNG jitter** on timeout or refusal,
  clamped to a cap. Jitter is load-bearing, not decoration: a fleet of Pis
  restored from the same image and rebooting together must not stampede one
  server.
- **A randomised initial delay** before the very first query, for the same
  reason. The `Unset`-clock case still resolves quickly — the delay is small
  and bounded — because a machine with no clock is unusable until it has one.
- **Kiss-o'-Death is obeyed** (RFC 5905 §7.4). A stratum-0 response's 4-octet
  reference id is decoded as a kiss code: `RATE` widens this server's poll
  interval, `DENY` and `RSTR` retire the server for the boot. Ignoring a KoD
  is exactly the abuse this section exists to prevent.
- Configuration lives in `lib/sysconfig`'s `system.conf` as new `time.*` keys
  (the server list and the refresh cadence), parsed by the existing
  fail-closed engine — an unknown key is refused as it already is for `net.*`.
  Server names resolve through `lib/resolver`.

### 3.1 Where the server list comes from

Three tiers, worst to best, in `lib/timesync::select_servers`. The first
non-empty tier wins **outright**; tiers are never merged.

| `ServerSource` | Source |
|---|---|
| `Fallback` | `FALLBACK_TIME_SERVERS` — `0.pool.ntp.org` … `3.pool.ntp.org`. |
| `Network` | DHCPv4 option 42 / DHCPv6 option 56 (or the RFC 4075 option 31 it supersedes), from the *current* lease. |
| `Configured` | The `time.servers` key an operator or installer wrote. |

- **Why not merge them.** A machine whose network named a server must not keep
  querying the public pool as well, and an operator who named one must not have
  a DHCP server's choice mixed into their list. Merging would make the
  configuration key advisory rather than authoritative.
- **Why a fallback exists at all.** RFC 8633 §3.1 asks a vendor shipping a
  fleet to obtain its own pool vendor zone rather than point every device at
  the generic names, and TAIRiX has none yet — but a machine that never queries
  has no clock, which is worse. The generic names are what it can honestly use,
  and what makes that acceptable is the §3 politeness policy applying to every
  tier alike plus the pool's own per-lookup DNS rotation. Registering a vendor
  zone changes only those four names.
- **A network-supplied server carries its address**, so it needs no resolver:
  a machine whose only DNS advice would have come from the same lease still
  keeps time. Its audit name is the address's text, never parsed back.
- **`ServerSource` is `Ord`ered worst-to-best**, so a caller compares tiers
  rather than re-deriving the precedence, and a running engine's servers are
  replaced only by a *strictly better* tier. An equal-tier change (a renewed
  lease naming a different server) would reset the rotation and backoff and
  forget which servers had refused, which costs more than it buys; the
  re-selection ladder's finite length bounds that churn instead.
- **The learned set is advice, not authority.** It reaches `timed` through the
  ungated `NET_TIME_SERVERS` system-information query (`netstack`'s
  `TimeServers` broker read, fronted by `sysinfod`) and is a set of addresses
  to *ask*. Every sample one returns is still nonce-gated and
  plausibility-checked in the §4 sandbox before any clock moves, so a hostile
  DHCP server can misdirect a query but cannot set a clock.

## 4. Security: the authority split

`timed` holds `CAP_TIME_SET`. Setting the machine clock arbitrarily is a real
attack — it can invalidate certificate lifetimes, reorder audit reasoning, and
move capability expiry — so the process holding that capability must not parse
an attacker-controlled packet.

The NTP decode therefore runs inside a **`lib/sandbox` worker holding nothing
but its pipe**, as a new `timesync` module beside the existing `decode`,
`helpdoc`, and `imagerender` consumers of that seam:

1. `timed` receives the datagram and copies a bounded 48 bytes into a request
   frame. Copying a fixed-length buffer is not parsing.
2. The worker decodes and validates, and replies with a candidate sample.
3. `timed` **re-validates the reply** — the nonce echo and the plausibility
   window — before applying anything. The worker is hostile the moment it has
   touched a byte; that is the seam's existing stated discipline.

A worker crash is a typed error to the caller, the worker is reaped and
replaced, and the event is logged with a stable id — all of which
`host::ParserSandbox` already does. Host tests drive the entire parent path
through `sandbox::loopback`, so the containment is covered without processes.

Every sync applied, sample rejected, and server retired is audited through
`lib/log` with a stable event id (§19.4).

**What a hostile DHCP server can and cannot do (accepted, §3.1).** Honouring
option 42 lets whoever controls DHCP name the server this machine asks. That is
a real exposure and it is accepted, because it adds nothing to what such an
attacker already holds: the same lease names the DNS servers every pool name
would resolve through and the router every NTP packet would traverse, so a
hostile DHCP server can redirect or intercept the query on any tier. The bound
on the damage is therefore the same on all three: the nonce echo (off-path
spoofing), the plausibility window and round-trip/stratum ceilings (an absurd
instant), the sandboxed decode (a hostile *packet*), and the provenance ladder
(a local counter cannot undo a sync). A *named* server can still move the clock
anywhere inside the plausibility window — that is inherent to unauthenticated
NTP, and the answer to it is authentication (NTS, RFC 8915), which §0 places
out of scope. An operator who cannot accept it sets `time.servers`, which
outranks the network's offer.

## 5. RTC support

The RTC class ABI is `lib/abi/src/driver/rtc.rs`: read and set an instant as
`Time64`, a declared precision, and honest `battery_backed` /
`oscillator_stopped` flags. It also carries the **BCD civil-time codec** every
chip's register block shares, so that encoding has one definition rather than
one per chip (§2.2); chip-specific register offsets, century bits, and quirks
stay in each chip's own driver (§2.22). `HwDeviceClass::Rtc` is appended to the
hardware-tree class set, never renumbering an existing discriminant.

A driver that cannot vouch for its reading — oscillator stopped, clock
integrity flag set, firmware refusal — reports the time as unavailable rather
than returning a fabricated one, and the node is left with the clock `Unset`
for `timed` to fix. An unbound RTC node is logged, never an error (§18.4).

Three tiers, in the order they land:

- **QEMU-emulable, one per hardware target** — the reference implementations,
  each with a QEMU vertical proving a `Firmware`-provenance clock before any
  network exists: `drivers/rtc/pl031/` (`arm,pl031`, the `aarch64 -M virt`
  RTC the tree's DTB path already discovers), `drivers/rtc/mc146818/` (the
  x86_64 CMOS RTC over a port-I/O resource, UIP-safe, honouring register B's
  binary/BCD and 12/24-hour bits, its node synthesised on the
  legacy-fallback discovery path §18.2 sanctions), and
  `drivers/rtc/goldfish/` (`google,goldfish-rtc`, the riscv64 `virt` RTC's
  64-bit nanosecond pair).
- **The Pi 5's built-in RTC** — `drivers/rtc/rpi/`, `raspberrypi,rpi-rtc`.
  The RTC is inside the PMIC and is *not* memory-mapped, so the VideoCore
  firmware mailbox is the only route: `lib/vcmailbox` grows the RTC property
  tags (get `0x0003_0087`, set `0x0003_8087`) with the `RTC_TIME` register
  selector, and the driver reaches them through `drivers/bus/mailbox`.
  Host-tested against the existing `vcmailbox::mock::MockFirmware`. Some Pi 5
  firmware revisions fail every mailbox property request, so the driver fails
  closed to "RTC unavailable" and never spins or hangs on the mailbox.
- **The I²C HAT chips Pi 3/4 use** — reached through a new bus path:
  `lib/i2c` holds the bus-agnostic transfer vocabulary (addressing, transfer
  direction, register sequences, error taxonomy) exactly as `lib/usb` and
  `lib/virtio` hold protocol without device logic, and
  `drivers/bus/i2c/bcm2835/` drives the Broadcom Serial Controller the whole
  Pi family exposes. The BSC driver is interrupt-driven (`irq_bind` /
  `irq_wait`, never a spin, §2.23) with a bounded fail-closed timeout on the
  hardware handshake, and it serves one grant-restricted IPC transfer
  endpoint per enumerated child — the pattern the USB host controllers
  already use. The chips: `drivers/rtc/ds3231/` (`maxim,ds3231`; its
  0x00–0x06 register block is the DS1307-compatible one, so `maxim,ds1307`
  binds here too), `drivers/rtc/pcf8523/` (`nxp,pcf8523`, the chip Raspberry
  Pi's own `i2c-rtc` overlay documentation names), and
  `drivers/rtc/pcf85063a/` (`nxp,pcf85063a`).

QEMU does not model the BSC, so the I²C tier is host-unit-tested against the
shared mock part with no QEMU vertical possible. Each affected driver's
`README.md` states that plainly; §8's emulable-hardware clause is satisfied by
the first tier.

## 6. Enable and disable

Automatic time-setting is on by default: the image's vendor enrolment layer
names `timed`. Turning it off is *unenrolment*, which is the service manager's
job, so both surfaces drive the one control path rather than inventing a second
switch (§2.2).

- **Command line.** `userland/shell/servicectl` is the tool — the `systemctl`
  analogue this plan's dependency (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-8)
  specifies. `enable`/`disable` reach PID 1 on its own reserved enrolment
  endpoint (TS-5b: deliberately *not* the running-state control one) and write
  through the pure `lib/enrolment` record transforms, which decide eligibility
  only, so enrolment can never widen authority.
- **Desktop.** The taskbar clock's menu gains a *Set Date & Time
  Automatically* toggle, derived from `clock_menu::ROWS` like every other row
  so a row cannot exist without a command behind it. The session holds no
  authority to change service enrolment, exactly as it holds none to set the
  clock, so the row reuses the re-authentication broker path the existing
  *Set Date & Time…* row already uses; a console with no broker renders the
  row non-actionable with the reason stated rather than offering a command
  that could only fail. The Date & Time settings pane exposes the same
  toggle over the same control path.

Landing `servicectl` requires the control **transport** —
`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-8's remaining item: a per-manager wait-set
reactor in PID 1 serving `SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` alongside child reaping
and arming the real one-shot linger/grace/restart/watchdog timers the engine
already computes deadlines for, plus `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` added *with* its
enforcement point and its first holder in the same change (§5.2). That is a
genuine prerequisite of this plan's third deliverable and is built properly,
not stubbed (§2.19).

## 7. Stages

Each stage leaves the whole-project §7 gate green before it is reported done.

### TS-1 — `lib/net::ntp` and `lib/timesync`: the engine and the policy — DONE
- `tairix_abi::time::{RELEASE_EPOCH_SECS, PLAUSIBLE_FUTURE_SECS,
  is_plausible_wall_time}` — the plausibility window, defined once, re-exported
  at the crate root, and mirrored into the generated C header beside the
  sibling time constants (`TAIRIX_RELEASE_EPOCH_SECS` /
  `TAIRIX_PLAUSIBLE_FUTURE_SECS`, emitted by the generator, not hand-edited).
- `lib/net::ntp` — the RFC 5905 §7.3 codec (`Header::decode` total over any
  buffer ≥ 48 bytes, a longer tail ignored so an extension-field or MAC-bearing
  reply is not refused), `NtpTimestamp` held as the wire's two 32-bit fields
  with era placement anchored on `RELEASE_EPOCH_SECS` (never on the local
  clock, which may be the wrong thing being corrected), the §0 validation
  rules, the sample computation (round trip from the *monotonic* legs minus the
  server's own processing, instant = transmit + ½ round trip), the §3
  politeness policy, and the `NtpClient` transaction machine with one folded
  `next_deadline()`. Shaped like `dhcp::DhcpClient` (non-blocking, poll /
  on_datagram) rather than `dns::resolve` (blocking one-shot), because a time
  client is a long-lived engine in a reactor; each entry point yields at most
  one action, so nothing is allocated.
- `lib/timesync` — the §2 decision matrix (`decide`), the `SyncRecord` whose
  `last_seen` never moves backwards, and the `TimeSync` client that turns a
  validated sample into a `ClockUpdate`. Provenance is always `Trusted`; the
  step-vs-refinement classification is audit-only, and an establishment carries
  no `correction` rather than a fabricated magnitude.
- Politeness invariants a future change must not break: **`MIN_POLL` bounds the
  steady state, not every packet** — a failed transaction retries sooner under
  the bounded exponential backoff, which is what RFC 8633 §3.2 and RFC 4330 §10
  permit for start-up and recovery, and that retry always rotates to the next
  server. Claiming a server is what advances the rotation cursor, so a failure
  path must not advance it again or a two-server client returns to the one that
  just failed. A Kiss-o'-Death hold is folded into the scheduled instant, so a
  `RATE` is waited out in a single sleep rather than a wake that finds every
  server still held off. Jitter scales by multiply-shift (a modulo leaves the
  top of the band unreachable and skews low) over a span clamped to
  `MAX_JITTER_SPAN_NANOS`, because overflow checks are on in every profile and
  an unclamped fixed-point multiply would panic rather than misbehave.
- 65 host tests (39 engine, 26 policy) over the decision matrix, the
  backoff/jitter/floor policy, the KoD codes, the anti-spoof gate under a
  wrong-nonce flood, and the pre-1970 / post-2038 / era-1 boundaries. The
  `fuzz_net_ntp` harness asserts the five never-panic / never-implausible /
  nonce-gate invariants and is registered in `cargo xtask fuzz`.
- Deferred to TS-2 by design (not a gap): the persisted record's on-disk
  encoding, the `time.*` configuration keys, and the sandboxed decode all
  belong with the service that owns the I/O.

### TS-2 — `timed`: the service — DONE
- `lib/net::ntp` gains `NtpClient::on_reply` and `lib/timesync` gains
  `TimeSync::on_reply` / `TimeSync::outstanding`: the transaction machine is
  reachable from an *already-evaluated* verdict, so a caller holding
  `CAP_TIME_SET` runs the decode elsewhere and the retry/rotation/KoD
  discipline still has exactly one implementation.
- `lib/sandbox::timesync` — `TimeSyncService` (the worker-side evaluation) and
  `evaluate_datagram` (the caller side). The caller gates the **nonce echo
  itself**, before the worker is involved, so a spoofed flood costs no round
  trip; only the fixed 48-byte header crosses; a returned sample is
  re-validated against the plausibility window, `MAX_ROUND_TRIP`, and the
  usable stratum range. `KissCode::Other` carries its four raw reference-id
  octets so a reader can diagnose the server.
- `tairix_abi::MAX_TIME_SERVERS` is the one server-count bound the config
  store validates against and `ntp::MAX_SERVERS` is defined as, so a
  configured server can never sit silently past the engine's reach.
- `lib/sysconfig` — `time.servers` (bounded host-operand list, `none` for the
  empty list so the render/parse round trip stays exact) and `time.refresh`
  (a closed cadence set, because the point of the cadence is politeness).
  `Key::values` became `Key::shape` (`ValueShape::Closed`/`Free`) and
  `SystemConfig::get` became `render_value`, since one key's value is no
  longer a fixed spelling.
- `lib/timesync` — the `SyncRecord` document codec: fixed-length, magicked,
  CRC-32C'd. A wrong length/magic, a torn rewrite, an implausible instant, an
  undefined flag bit, or a `last_seen` before its `last_sync` all resolve to
  `EMPTY`, so the stale-boot and went-backwards rules do not fire on a
  fiction. The checksum guards corruption, not tampering.
- `userland/system/timed` — the engine over injected `Clock`/`RecordStore`/
  `Transport` seams plus the freestanding tickless reactor (one wait-set, the
  folded deadline, park never poll), the `23000..24000` audit range, the
  service account (`timed`, uid 18, `TIMED_CEILING`), `TIMED_MANIFEST`, the
  `AppInfo.toml`, and the boot-floor registration in PID 1's startup config
  and the x86_64/riscv64 embedded spawn floor.
- **Config availability is a boot-order fact, not a bug.** The store lives on
  the encrypted root and this is a boot-floor service, so the first read
  normally precedes the mount. With no userland "root mounted" event, the
  reactor re-selects on a bounded doubling one-shot ladder (8 attempts, ~17
  minutes, parking between them). TS-7 made that ladder also the mechanism
  that picks up a DHCP lease acquired after start-up; configuring a server
  after the ladder is spent means restarting the service.
- **Every socket client's delivery port is process-private.** The kernel's
  port registry is machine-wide, so a fixed well-known id would let a
  long-lived process deny another its deliveries for the boot;
  `tairix_rt::bind_private_port` draws an unreserved CSPRNG id under a bounded
  budget, and `timed`, `lib/resolver`, `ping`, and `telnet` all bind through
  it. A delivery is believed only from the network stack's kernel-attested
  service account (`tairix_abi::net::from_network_stack`), never from
  whichever process posted first. `timed` opens the resolver's transport only
  for a server that is *not* an address literal.
- QEMU vertical `tairix-test-timed-qemu-aarch64` over the `time-net-root`
  disk: the peer answers each request **twice, spoof first**, and the serial
  gate requires the *exact* applied `wall_secs=` of the truthful reply — so a
  guest that believed the spoof, or that let the spoof cancel its outstanding
  transaction, fails the run. That one choreography covers both the sync and
  the anti-spoof property; a separate "wrong nonce is refused" case would have
  had no positive witness, because a spoofed packet is deliberately not
  audited (per-packet audit of an injected flood is itself a denial of
  service).
- The configuration re-read ladder arms on any selection below the
  `Configured` tier (originally: on any read that finds no server).
  An earlier attempt to disarm it when the store's path had no VFS backing —
  meaning to spare a volume-less guest a pointless timer — stranded the
  service on every ordinary boot instead: an unmounted encrypted root is
  indistinguishable from an absent one at `open`, so `timed` gave up three
  seconds before the unlock and never set the clock. The ladder's own finite
  length is what bounds the volume-less case; the classification is not worth
  attempting. Pinned by host tests over `ConfigRetry`, which lives in the
  engine half so it is testable at all.
- The `spawn_session` verticals' silence after `login` spawns was **not** the
  §17.1 cooperative-dispatch defect. Their audit sinks keyed PASS on raw
  `ProcessSpawned`/`SyscallInvoked` totals, so adding `timed` to the startup
  set met both thresholds at login's *first* spawn and the guest exited
  before the harness sent a single scripted line. They now key on the
  identity of each step through the shared
  `tairix-test-spawn-supervision` witness, which no service addition can
  shift. All three now pass.
- The record write no longer attempts an unconditional `mkdir` of
  `/System/Settings/Time`. That directory is authored by every image builder
  and its parent is system-owned, so the attempt was refused on every
  provisioned machine and filed a denied-mutation audit record on each
  successful sync — routine noise a real denial would have hidden in. The
  directory is created only when the record file itself is absent.
- The vertical had **no termination condition at all**, so it could never have
  passed. The guest carried no `qemu_exit`, on the stated basis that the
  harness would drive its serial script to completion — but a run ends only
  when the guest exits or a completion gate fires, and this peer's gate is
  deliberately neither. The guest now exits on `timed`'s `CLOCK_SET` record,
  gated on the applied `wall_secs` equalling the fixture instant, so a guest
  that believed the spoof records different seconds and never exits. That
  witness sits on the **diagnostic** sink, not the audit one: a service's own
  records reach only the former (`kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`'s `log_emit`).
  The serial script therefore ends at the session prompt — a step gated on the
  clock record would still be pending when the guest exits on that same
  record, which the runner reports as an unfinished script.
- Its serial script was also mis-ordered: it waited for the clock record and
  *then* for a shell prompt, but the prompt is printed seconds earlier and the
  matcher only searches forward, so it typed nothing and the run sat idle
  until the deadline. Prompt now precedes the clock gate.
- `timed`'s enrolment and SUM1 unit metadata are TS-5b's: it is registered
  from the enrolled startup-config tier and changed through the enrolment
  endpoint.

### TS-3 — RTC class + the QEMU-emulable RTCs — DONE

**The clock authority stays with `timed`.** An RTC driver holds no clock
capability: it serves the `Rtc` class over `tairix_abi::rtc_ipc`'s
`RTC_ENDPOINT`, and `timed` — the sole `CAP_TIME_SET` holder, a documented
invariant this plan must not break — reads it and tags the reading `Firmware`
itself. §1's "it sets the clock as `Firmware`" is the *outcome*, not the
issuer: `wall_time_set` takes provenance from its caller, so a driver holding
the capability could assert `Trusted` and the ladder below would be worthless.

**The provenance ladder is kernel-enforced, not driver politeness.**
`WallTimeState::supersedes` ranks `Unset` < `Firmware` < {`Trusted`,
`Adjusted`}, with the top two deliberately equal so a network sync still
corrects a manual step and a manual step still corrects a sync, while neither
can be undone by a local counter. `KernelWallClock::set` refuses a losing
write with `Errno::AlreadyExists` and leaves the stored reading and the
monotonic capture untouched.

**`lib/abi::time` owns the civil calendar.** `CivilTime`, `days_from_civil`,
`civil_from_days`, and `days_in_month` live there (`lib/fsmeta` keeps only the
alloc-dependent `iso_minute` spelling), which also removed the `fat32` and
`tools/xtask` copies of the same algorithm.

**The class and the wire.** `lib/abi/src/driver/rtc.rs` carries the `Rtc`
trait (`status` / `read` / `set`), `RtcStatus`, and the shared BCD codec plus
`resolve_two_digit_year`, which resolves a chip's `yy` inside the same fixed
plausibility window the wall clock validates against. `read` answers
`Ok(None)` for a chip that cannot vouch — a value, not an error, because a
flat backup cell is ordinary. `HwDeviceClass::Rtc = 11` is appended.
`lib/abi/src/rtc_ipc.rs` is the status-framed wire contract and the
`serve_request` transform every RTC driver runs, bound restricted-sender under
`CAP_TIME_SET` (no new capability: the clock authority is exactly the
principal that may touch the chip). One well-known id, not a slot range — a
second RTC would need a selection policy no consumer has, so a second driver's
`call_create` fails closed and it stands down, leaving the first RTC in
hardware-tree order.

**`timed`** gained the `RtcSource` seam, the RTC read at start-up (before the
decision matrix, so a board with a chip enters it with a `Firmware` clock),
the write-back of a validated sample, and audit ids `23013..=23017`. The read
climbs the same bounded doubling `RetryLadder` the configuration read does,
since "no userland event says it is there now" is one problem, not two.

**The generic FDT→hardware-tree walk is shared, and riscv64 is on it.**
aarch64 held the only generic `compatible` walk; riscv64 emitted a root, a
memory window, and a bare unbindable timer, so `google,goldfish-rtc` was never
discovered and *nothing* could ever autoload on that port. The charter forbids
a second copy, so the walk was hoisted rather than duplicated:

- **`lib/fdt::bus`** now holds the bus-aware `reg` decoder — `BusLevel`,
  `translate`, `translated_reg`, `reg_entry_count`, `dma_ranges_aperture`,
  `outbound_mmio_window`, `scan_translated`, `MAX_WALK_DEPTH`. It is pure
  Devicetree address translation with no hardware-tree dependency, so it
  belongs beside the parser.
- **`kernel/arch/api::fdtwalk`** holds the walk itself: the root emission, the
  per-depth bus/ancestor tracking, `classify`, the `compatible`→match-key
  decode, the MMIO and MAC resources, and the drop rule for nodes no driver
  could bind. A port contributes an `FdtPlatform` — the interrupt specifier's
  cell width and cells→line mapping, plus any board augmentation — and spells
  its discovery type as `FdtDiscovery<'_, P>`. The impl is a *value* built
  from the tree once, because riscv64's mapping needs a tree-wide fact (the
  PLIC's `riscv,ndev`) that aarch64's does not.
- aarch64 keeps only the GIC decode and the BCM2711 mailbox/GENET/PCIe
  augmentation; riscv64 keeps only the single-cell PLIC decode, bounded by
  `riscv,ndev` so the tree never carries a line the controller cannot raise.

**The user-space port-I/O trap.** `HwResourceKind::Port` was in the ABI but no
syscall let a granted driver issue `inb`/`outb`, so the x86_64 CMOS clock had
no path at all. `PORT_READ` (117) and `PORT_WRITE` (118) close it: the kernel
resolves the grant handle against the calling task, confirms it names a port
range, and confirms the whole `port .. port + width` transfer lies inside it
before issuing anything. Unbounded port I/O is privilege escalation — the
ports a machine exposes include the interrupt controller, the DMA controller,
and the reset line — so this is bounded by the same unforgeable grant
`mmio_map` is, and gated on the same `CAP_MMIO_MAP` the port resource already
requires (no new capability). `PortWidth` carries the three architectural
widths and is validated rather than trusted, because a wider access than the
grant covers reaches a neighbour's registers; a value is narrowed to its width
once, into a `PortValue`, so the two cannot disagree below that point. Only
the x86 family installs a producer; every other port fails both traps closed.

**Shipped and proven.** `drivers/rtc/pl031/` (`arm,pl031`) and
`drivers/rtc/goldfish/` (`google,goldfish-rtc`) are host-tested `lib` targets
beside their `Run` binaries, cross-compiled and signed into the per-board
`rtc-root` driver store by `tools/xtask`'s `image_drivers`. Two QEMU verticals
— one per port — boot the production pipeline against that store with **no NIC
driver and no unlock**, and exit on `timed`'s `RTC_CLOCK_SET` carrying a
`wall_secs` inside the window the harness pinned the emulated chip to
(`-rtc base=`, `tests/integration/rtc_fixture`). Gating on the *value* is what
makes the run worth having: a byte-swapped counter, a wrong register, a
fabricated epoch, and a missed nanosecond scale are all still *plausible* wall
times and all miss the window. The store deliberately carries the clock driver
alone, so a clock established there cannot have come from the network.

`drivers/rtc/mc146818/` (`motorola,mc146818`) landed with them, over the port
trap rather than a mapped window: UIP-safe double-read with a bounded budget
that fails closed, Register B's binary/BCD and 12/24-hour bits both honoured,
Register D's valid-RAM bit as the health signal, and `resolve_two_digit_year`
rather than the century register at `0x32` (whose presence is declared by the
ACPI FADT, which the driver does not see). `kernel/arch/x86_64`'s
legacy-fallback discovery path synthesises its node with the `0x70`/`0x71`
port pair, and the bundle ships in the x86_64 driver store.

**All three ports are proven.**
`tairix-test-rtc-mc146818-qemu-x86-64` boots the production x86_64 pipeline
against the same `rtc-root` disk with the same value-gated witness. It is worth
more than a third copy of one proof: the CMOS chip is the class's only
port-addressed part, so this is the only witness that a granted **port range**
reaches a real device from user space, and its node is *synthesised* rather
than parsed, so it is the only run that exercises the legacy-fallback discovery
path. Neither MMIO sibling can show either.

The x86_64 full-boot shape this hangs on is **not** new work and must not be
re-derived: `autoload_input_qemu_x86_64` and `netstack_autoload_qemu_x86_64`
already boot `boot_x86_64::boot` against a planted whole disk over virtio-PCI,
so a clock vertical here is an enrolment entry plus a witness sink, exactly as
on the two MMIO ports.

### TS-4 — Pi RTC support — DONE

**The mailbox tier.** `lib/vcmailbox` carries the RTC property tags — get
`0x0003_0087`, set `0x0003_8087`, with a two-word value buffer holding a
register selector and its value — plus `RtcRegister` (`Time`,
`BackupVolts`; the firmware's own selector numbering, only the two spelled
that have a caller). The decode requires the **per-tag response bit** and
checks the **echoed selector**, so the two ways this chip could lie about
itself are both closed: a firmware that stamps top-level success without
processing the tag would otherwise read as 1970, and one that answered about
the backup cell would have millivolts served as a wall time. A write is
tolerated with zero response words (there is nothing to return) but not with a
mismatched echo. `mock::MockFirmware` models both registers statefully — a
write sticks — so a consumer's set-then-read round trip is faithful; its
`respond` therefore takes `&mut self`, and a `MailboxChannel` test double over
it needs the `RefCell` shape the production `vcmailbox` service already uses.

`drivers/rtc/rpi/` (`raspberrypi,rpi-rtc`) is the driver. It is the class's
first part with **no address at all** — no window, no port pair — so it maps
nothing and its only resource is the IPC path: `RtDriverHost`'s
`MailboxChannel` over `MAILBOX_ENDPOINT`, gated kernel-side by `CAP_MAILBOX`.
Its matched node legitimately requests no resources, so the grant set is
empty. Two decisions worth not re-deriving:

- **A counter of zero is the chip's own "never set since it lost power"
  signal**, which is the state a board with no backup cell comes up in. `read`
  answers `Ok(None)` for it and `set` *refuses* to write it, so the two agree
  and nothing this driver writes can read back as no-time. This is a single
  distinguished hardware sentinel, not a plausibility window — that stays in
  `timed`.
- **`battery_backed` comes from the backup cell's own voltage register.** The
  battery is an optional accessory on every Pi that has this clock, so a board
  name would not be evidence. A firmware that does not know the register
  answers zero, which reads as "no cell" — the conservative direction.

The bundle requests `CAP_MAILBOX` + `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` and **not**
`CAP_MMIO_MAP`: the only RTC bundle that needs no mapping authority. It ships
in the flashable Pi image's store at `Drivers/rtc/rpi/Run` and stays unbound on
a Pi 3 or Pi 4, which have no such node. `timed`'s existing bounded RTC ladder
(1 s doubling, 6 rungs) already covers the mailbox service coming up after the
clock driver, so nothing there changed.

No QEMU vertical is possible — QEMU models no `VideoCore` — so the protocol
and every fail-closed path are host-proven and the live channel is the on-metal
acceptance item, exactly as for the rest of `plans/PI.md`'s mailbox work.

**The I²C tier.** §5 fixed the *requirement* — one grant-restricted transfer
endpoint per child, so a chip driver can never address a neighbour on the bus
— and I²C has no enumeration protocol to satisfy it with: a driver learns only
its own grants, `hw_tree_read` is the privileged global inventory, and probing
every address is forbidden and can be destructive. The shape that landed is
**the parent carries the duty, the child carries the authority, and both come
from the device tree**:

- **`kernel/arch/api::fdtwalk`** (shared by aarch64 and riscv64) recognises a
  bus child by the Devicetree convention for a non-memory-mapped addressed bus
  — parent `#address-cells = <1>` with `#size-cells = <0>` — so it stays
  platform-neutral. `/cpus` spells itself the same way, so a CPU node is
  excluded by its own spec-defined `device_type`. Each such child's endpoint id
  is `hwtree::BUS_CHILD_ENDPOINTS` indexed by its hardware-tree node id; the child
  node gets a plain `Endpoint` resource naming it and the **parent** gets a new
  `HwResourceKind::BusChild = 9` pairing that id with the child's bus address
  (`base`/`xlate`, the `Framebuffer` precedent for a paired record).
- **The parent is emitted before its children, so the duties are read ahead.**
  A cloned walk iterator replays the *same* emission predicate (`is_emitted`,
  now the one definition `build_node` also applies) to predict the ids the walk
  is about to assign. A child past the parent's `HW_NODE_MAX_RESOURCES` gets no
  duty **and** no endpoint — the two halves can never disagree, and that chip
  is simply left unbound and logged.
- **Binding a bus-child endpoint requires the duty grant.** The block is
  reserved (`ipc::is_reserved_endpoint`), and `call_create` additionally
  resolves a `BusChild` grant covering the id against the *calling task*, so a
  second privileged driver cannot claim a chip's endpoint first and feed its
  driver forged registers. `covers` gives `BusChild ⊃ Endpoint(same id)`, which
  is also what would let a bus driver forward the endpoint onto a node it
  publishes.
- **The wire carries no address.** `lib/abi::driver::i2c`'s `I2cPort` is one
  *part*, not a bus, and `i2c_ipc`'s frame is two phase lengths plus a payload:
  the bus driver takes the address from the duty grant paired with the endpoint
  a request arrived on. A chip driver has no field in which to name a
  neighbour, whatever it believes about the bus. `I2cAddress::from_bus_address`
  narrows the grant's 64-bit field rather than truncating it, so a malformed
  tree leaves a child unserved instead of pointing the controller elsewhere.
- **`lib/i2c`** holds the register-transaction protocol (`Device`: block/single
  read, block/single write, and the `update_one` read-modify-write that writes
  only a change) plus `mock::MockPart`, the one register-file part double every
  chip driver's host tests drive. `MAX_BLOCK_LEN` is derived from the seam's
  own per-phase bound, never restated.
- **`drivers/bus/i2c/bcm2835`** is the BSC: IRQ-driven through the host's
  `wait_irq` park (which `VirtioHost::notify_wait` now also routes through, one
  definition), one restricted-sender endpoint per duty, and a per-phase
  deadline sized from the slowest bus rate the driver tolerates — a liveness
  backstop for a wedged controller, not a bus-speed bound, since clock
  stretching is bounded by the controller's own timeout register. Two facts
  worth not re-deriving: **whether the address was acknowledged comes from
  `DLEN`**, which reads back the bytes still to move once a transfer has begun
  (the bytes the driver pushed into the FIFO say nothing — a write phase fills
  it before the part answers); and **aborting a transfer needs the enable bit
  dropped**, because the control register has no abort, so recovery disables,
  clears, and re-enables. It does not touch the clock divider: the bus speed is
  the board's, and nothing in discovery tells a driver what the part is rated
  for. The BSC cannot emit a true repeated START — a documented limitation, so
  a multi-master bus is out of scope.
- **`drivers/rtc/ds3231`** (`maxim,ds3231`, and `maxim,ds1307` on the same
  `0x00..=0x06` block), **`drivers/rtc/pcf8523`** (`nxp,pcf8523`), and
  **`drivers/rtc/pcf85063a`** (`nxp,pcf85063a`). Each honours its own
  oscillator-stop / clock-integrity flag by answering `Ok(None)` rather than
  reporting registers it cannot vouch for, and clears the flag only with the
  write that puts a real time in. The DS3231's century bit is masked off and
  never read as a century — it is a carry the chip toggles when the year field
  wraps. The two PCF parts put the chip in 24-hour mode at bring-up
  (read-modify-write, so the board's other settings survive) because the mode
  lives in a control register a previous owner could have left anywhere, while
  still honouring a 12-hour *field* on read. `battery_backed` is evidence, not
  a part number: the DS3231's own cell input is its purpose, the PCF8523 reads
  its switch-over setting, and the PCF85063A has no such circuit and reports
  `false`. An instant the two-digit year could not read back as itself is
  refused on write.
- **The 12-hour conversion is now the class's**
  (`driver::rtc::{hour_from_twelve, twelve_from_hour}`), hoisted out of
  `mc146818` rather than written a fourth time: which bit carries PM and
  whether the field is BCD differ per chip, the arithmetic does not.
- All four bundles ship in the flashable Pi store. **QEMU models no BSC**, so
  no vertical is possible for the tier and each README says so; the protocol
  and every fail-closed path are host-proven and the live bus is an on-metal
  acceptance item.
- Fixed in passing: the generated C header omitted `HwResourceKind::LinkAddress`
  entirely. The emission now iterates `HwResourceKind::ALL` (asserted dense by a
  unit test) through an exhaustive-match name function, so a kind cannot reach a
  C consumer's header as an unnamed discriminant again.

### TS-5a — Service-control transport + `servicectl start`/`stop` — DONE
The PID 1 wait-set control reactor and its one-shot timers,
`CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` with its enforcement point (the restricted-sender
endpoint bind) and its first holder, and the `servicectl` tool with its bundle
`Help/` tree and coreutils-shaped options and exit codes (§16.7). The design
and the decisions live in `plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-8; they are not
repeated here. QEMU witness: `tairix-test-servicectl-qemu-aarch64` runs a live
`servicectl stop timed` from a logged-in shell.

The tool's icon is authored as **SVG**, the charter's preferred form for an
icon expressible in the vector subset — one file serves every slot and UI
scale, so no slot ever upscales a raster.

### TS-5b — Enablement: `Enable`/`Disable` — DONE
The enrolment ops, over the *enrolment* path rather than the control endpoint:
`Enable`/`Disable` write through the pure `lib/enrolment` record transforms,
which decide eligibility only; the kernel derives authority at spawn. This is also
where `timed`'s SUM1 unit metadata is authored and where `timed` moves out of
the compiled-in boot floor into the `enrolled` startup-config tier. QEMU
vertical `tairix-test-enrol-qemu-aarch64`: a live `servicectl disable timed`
survives a reboot.

Reading enrolment and lifecycle state back is **TS-5c**, below: it is served
through the System Information API (§16.6), never a control-reply scrape, so
it is a separate query with its own capability gate rather than a third
enrolment op.

### TS-5c — `servicectl list` / `status SERVICE`
Not started. One paged System Information query behind both verbs — `list` is
the walk with no name filter, `status` the same walk looking for one row — so
the two can never disagree about a service's state, and a second singular
query is not added. A new `SysinfoQueryId` at the end of `SYSINFO_QUERIES`,
gated `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` and audited, because the answer names other
principals and their pids exactly as `GLOBAL_PROCESS_LIST` does. `sysinfod`
brokers it to PID 1 over a **read-only** reserved endpoint bound requiring
`CAP_SYSINFO_INTROSPECT` on the sender — which `sysinfod` alone holds — so the
audited query is the only way in, unlike netstack's ungated read endpoint. The
row set spans both enrolment tiers: the unenrolled-but-known specs PID 1
retains (`Init::unenrolled`) must appear too, or a disabled service would be
invisible and `enable` would look impossible. `list` takes no operand, so it is
the first verb whose arity differs from `servicectl`'s one-operand grammar, and
the `WrongOperandCount` path stays fail-closed for both arities rather than
becoming "any number is fine".

**The enrolment record is two layers, and that shape is forced by
`plans/NEW-NAMESPACE.md` §5.** PID 1 must know what is enrolled *before* the
encrypted root is unlocked — the RTC verticals boot with no unlock at all, and
a machine's clock service must reach its chip without one — yet an
administrator must be able to change enrolment at runtime. The target
namespace policy pins `attach.system.flags = ro` and
`project./System/Settings = root:/System/Settings`, so the pre-unlock volume
can never become the mutable store and the mutable path can never be read
pre-unlock. One document cannot be both, so there are two, layered exactly as
a bundle's `DefaultSettings/` layers under its own store (§16.5) — never
copied, never merged into a third place:

| Layer | Where | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Vendor | the `enrolled` directives of PID 1's startup configuration | the build |
| Administrator | `/System/Settings/Services/overrides` on the encrypted root | PID 1, on a control request |

- **The vendor layer is not on disk, and a QEMU run is what settled that.** An
  earlier shape put it at `/System/Services/enabled` on the read-only volume.
  The vertical failed with `SERVICE_NOT_ENROLLED`: no document under `/System`
  is reliably readable at the instant PID 1 must decide what to bring up — the
  writable root is not mounted, and the read-only volume's availability at that
  point is a boot-order fact PID 1 has no userland event for. The only
  sanctioned pre-unlock read is the store service's whitelist, gated on
  `CAP_DRV_LOAD`, which PID 1 must not hold to read a configuration file. So the
  image's decision travels the way the rest of the boot set already does — in
  the startup configuration — and the on-disk vendor document waits for the
  `/System/Services` discovery scan (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-5), which
  needs that same pre-unlock read path and will have to answer this question
  properly. This also retires the `SystemConfigFile::SystemServices` whitelist
  entry, which named a path the mount table makes unreachable and never had a
  reader (§2.14).
- **The administrator layer holds only what was changed**, as
  `<name> enabled|disabled` lines, so a system update that ships a different
  vendor default takes effect at once for every service the administrator has
  not spoken about.
- **`effective` = vendor with the overrides applied**, one pure function
  (`tairix_enrolment::effective`), so no consumer re-derives the precedence.
- **Applying the administrator layer is bounded by the unlock, and that is
  stated rather than hidden.** Pre-unlock, PID 1 obeys the vendor layer alone;
  the moment the override document becomes readable — on a bounded doubling
  one-shot ladder, since nothing announces the unlock — it re-derives the
  effective set and *stops* a service the administrator disabled, through the
  existing reverse-dependency `stop`, with an audit record. So a disabled
  service does run for the few seconds before the unlock, every boot. Closing
  that window would need the override readable pre-unlock, which the volume
  layout forbids; deferring the whole enrolled tier until the ladder resolves
  would instead deny a never-unlocking machine (a recovery session, an RTC
  vertical) its clock for the ladder's whole length. The bounded run is the
  lesser cost and is not a fail-open: nothing is *granted* by the document being
  unreadable, and the vendor default is a positive build-time decision — this is
  a narrowing that arrives late.

**`Enable`/`Disable` arrive on PID 1's own reserved endpoint, not the control
one.** `SERVICE_ENROL_ENDPOINT` is a second reserved id beside
`SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT`, sharing that module's request framing (one codec,
§2.2) but carrying its own op set and its own reply, because the answers differ
in kind: control answers with a `ServiceState`, enrolment with an enabled or
disabled disposition and whether it changed. Keeping them apart is
`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-8's decision and it is not reversed here; the
endpoint, not the module, is what that decision is about. Both are gated by the
existing `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` — no new capability, because nothing yet needs
to grant a principal the power to restart a wedged service without also
trusting it to disable one (§5.2), and the *durable* form of an administrative
act is not a different authority from the transient form. Both will become
scope-derived together when the per-user manager lands (SVC-8's open item).

- **The authority is the identity boundary, not a capability computation.**
  `plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-8 records why enrolment carries no
  manifest/ceiling refusal: an
  administrator's ceiling carries none of the service-scoped capabilities a
  system service holds, `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` among them, so the check would
  refuse enabling `timed` itself.
- **A service must be *known* to be enrolled.** The request names a service PID
  1 has a spec for; a typo can never record a phantom enrolment that a later
  image would silently activate (fail closed).
- **PID 1 gains `CAP_FS_ACCESS`** to read the layer it obeys and write the
  administrator's override. Per-inode authorisation still applies under its
  attested identity, and the vendor layer's volume is mounted read-only, so its
  reach there can never write.

**`timed`'s SUM1 metadata carries no readiness requirement, and that corrects
this plan's own earlier `requires: network-up`.** §1 recorded both that and
"needs no readiness gate"; the RTC work settled it — a machine with no NIC
still needs its clock service to read its chip, and TS-3/TS-4's verticals boot
exactly that machine, so gating admission on the network would deny a
no-NIC board its `Firmware` clock. The metadata is
`activation: permanent`, `restart: on-failure`, no `requires`.

**Open, and deliberately not answered here: what the desktop row *means* now
that `timed` also reads the RTC.** §6 fixed the switch as `timed`'s enrolment
while `timed` was purely an NTP client, so "disable automatic time-setting"
and "unenrol `timed`" were the same act. TS-3/TS-4 gave the same service the
RTC, so unenrolling it now also stops the chip being read and written back —
a machine with a healthy battery-backed clock would boot `Unset`. The switch
stays enrolment (a `time.*` key would be the second switch §2.2 and §6
forbid), and whether the row should instead mean "network time only" is a
product question for TS-6 to settle, not a defect in the mechanism.

**TS-6 depends on TS-5b, not TS-5a.** The desktop toggle is *automatic
time-setting on or off*, which is enrolment; the running-state control TS-5a
landed is not the switch that row needs.

### TS-6 — The desktop toggle
The taskbar clock menu row and the Date & Time settings pane entry over the
one control path, through the existing elevation broker. QEMU desktop
vertical: toggle off, confirm `timed` is disabled.

### TS-7 — The server tiers: a built-in default and the DHCP-supplied server — DONE

Replaced TS-2's empty default server list with the three-tier §3.1 policy, so
a stock installation keeps time with no configuration.

- **`lib/net::dhcp`** learns DHCPv4 option 42 (`DhcpReply.ntp_servers`,
  `Lease.ntp_servers`) and asks for it in the parameter request list — a server
  only supplies an option it was asked for. **`lib/net::dhcpv6`** learns
  RFC 5908 option 56's `SRV_ADDR` sub-options and the RFC 4075 option 31 list
  it supersedes, requesting both in the ORO since either may be deployed; a
  reply carrying both is taken at its option-56 word rather than merged. Both
  are bounded by the same fixed `MAX_ADDRESSES` the router/DNS lists are, and
  the fuzz harnesses assert it.
- **`Stack::dhcp_ntp_servers()`** is the twin of `dhcp_dns_servers()` over one
  shared walk of the two live leases (`dhcp_learned`), so acquisition and
  withdrawal track exactly and neither accessor can drift from the other.
- **One record type for both server sets.** `NetResolverServer` became
  `NetServerAddr`: an address is an address, so the resolver and time-server
  broker reads share one wire record, one codec, and one unicast check rather
  than a copied pair. `NetstackRequest::TimeServers` (op 14) is the read,
  `Interfaces::time_servers()` the source, `SysinfoQueryId::NET_TIME_SERVERS`
  (37) the ungated client query `sysinfod` fronts, and
  `procinfo::for_each_time_server` the client walk — beside
  `for_each_resolver_server` over one private paging helper in the renamed
  `procinfo::netservers`. `state:net/time/servers` renders it.
- **The time set has no static tier, deliberately.** A statically chosen time
  server is `time.servers`, which *outranks* the network's offer; mixing them
  in the stack would destroy the distinction `select_servers` needs.
- **`lib/timesync::servers`** holds the policy: `FALLBACK_TIME_SERVERS`,
  `ServerSource` (`Ord`ered worst-to-best), `TimeServer` (a spelling plus the
  address a source already supplied), and `select_servers`. Pure and host
  tested; the crate gained `alloc` for the owned result.
- **`timed`** takes a `ServerSelection` and a refresh cadence rather than a
  `SystemConfig`, drops the `tairix-sysconfig` edge from its engine half, and
  audits the tier as a `source` field on its start-up record. Its reactor
  re-selects on the existing ladder — one mechanism for both "the root is not
  mounted yet" and "no lease yet" — replacing servers only on a strictly
  better tier and disarming at `Configured`. Event 23_003 became
  `SERVERS_FROM_FALLBACK`: the fact worth recording is no longer "no server
  was configured" but "the search ended and the fallback stands".
- The QEMU witness is `tairix-test-timed-dhcp-qemu-aarch64`, with **no**
  configured server: the peer's DHCP lease carries option 42 naming itself,
  and the guest must apply the fixture instant. Only a guest that read the
  option finds a reachable server, because the fallback names cannot resolve
  on an isolated wire — so ignoring option 42 fails the run rather than
  quietly falling back.
- **Both time verticals gate on a *window*, not the base second.** A validated
  sample's instant is the server's transmit timestamp advanced by half the
  **measured** round trip, and the engine accepts a round trip up to
  `ntp::MAX_ROUND_TRIP`, so the applied second is the fixture's base plus up to
  half that ceiling. The witnesses originally required the base exactly, which
  held only while the round trip stayed sub-second: under the full QEMU matrix
  a guest measures whole seconds between its request leaving and its reply
  being read, the engine correctly compensated, and the gate then rejected a
  perfectly correct clock. `applied_is_fixture_sample` is the one shared
  predicate both witnesses use, with its window *derived* from
  `MAX_ROUND_TRIP` rather than restated — so it can never drift from the engine
  and can never be widened to make a slow run pass. It stays a million seconds
  clear of the spoof, so every discrimination the witness exists for survives.
  Do not reintroduce an exact-second gate on any clock a delay compensation
  passes through.
