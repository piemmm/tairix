# NEW-FILEMANAGER.md — the `files` app becomes a first-class file manager

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This is the staged build plan that takes the
Stage 7 `files` app (`userland/apps/files`, `tairix-files`) from the
keyboard-only, single-fixed-window directory browser it is today into a
first-class graphical file manager: clickable file/folder icons that open
directories, launch `.app` bundles, and hand files to the right viewer;
in-place rename; move/copy/delete; and make-directory — all done cleanly,
with a coherent, best-in-class UI and **without** the bloat of Windows
Explorer or the per-panel inconsistency of the typical Linux file manager.

Read first, in order: `AGENTS.md` (all of it), `plans/APPWIN.md` (AW1–AW5
— the window channel, the shared `lib/browse` engine, the CU6
one-shot `fd_grant`/`fd_redeem` delegation this builds directly on),
`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` (the `lib/controls` widget vocabulary every
surface here composes — no second control implementation, §2.2),
`plans/APPS.md` (command-word resolution / bundle lookup the "open with"
path reuses), `plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` (CU6 trusted-UI picker sizing),
`docs/src/filesystem/drives.md` (the storage-forest path model — `/` is a
view, not the root of storage), and `plans/DISPLAY.md` (the seat/display
model). Every rule in all of them applies here without exception.

**Note:** `abi-v1` is *not* frozen (the standing task direction supersedes
the `AGENTS.md`/`PLAN.md` language). A `lib/abi` change today is allowed;
it requires regenerating the C header (`cargo xtask c-header --write`),
which the drift guard enforces.

| FM19 | A window follows every change any program makes to the folder it shows, through the directory watch, repainting only the rows that moved | done |

`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D98 is the one open block: the QEMU harness cannot
order a typed key after a pointer click, so two guest click-throughs cannot be
driven. Both product halves are landed and host-tested; only the guest witness
is missing.

**FM15** — a press on a selected entry that travels past `DRAG_SLOP` hands the
session the drag (`BeginDrag`: the first item's name, the count, and whether it
is one openable file); dropped on a slot that claims the file, the manager
takes the chosen application (`TakeDropTarget`) and opens the file for it
exactly as its "Open With" does, so no path and no authority crosses to the
desktop. Drops onto its own windows and the desktop are
`plans/FILES-INTERACTION.md` FI9. Every document open — activation, "Open With", a drop —
runs on the reader worker (`Reads`), FIFO: resolving the application waits
for the bundle scan when it has not landed, and the `fs_open` of the document
never runs on the loop that owes the window a frame. A document is opened
read-write for an application whose manifest edits documents, where the user
may write it.

**FM14** — the manager spawns the viewer itself whenever the desktop's funnel
answers `NotRunning`, and the desktop used to answer that every time because it
resolved a slot's application from its own launch bookkeeping rather than from
the kernel's attestation. Two pictures therefore produced two viewers, each
with its own unattributed icon-bar slot. Fixed in the session
(`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T19); the manager's own side is unchanged except that
its "Open With…" table now discovers installed bundles through the shared
`lib/appstore` walk instead of a private copy of it. Witnessed by
`handover_qemu_aarch64`, which no longer pre-launches the viewer.

## What the landed work guarantees

FM13 is the
places/devices rail; the grid view's file-class artwork it draws comes from
`plans/ICONS.md`. **The UI-polish
increment** makes the browser window **resizable/maximizable**
(`files.app` opens `resizable` and re-maps its zero-copy frame region on a
`WindowEvent::Resized`, laying the shared renderer out to the new viewport;
fail-closed re-map, min-size clamp), labels every permission toggle — the
Permissions section is the shared form family's access and ownership groups
(FM8b) — and enlarges **icon-only buttons** to fill their plate. The
icon-only glyph is now sized from the plate (the smaller plate dimension inside
its frame, less a margin proportional to the plate — `lib/controls`
`icon_content_side`) instead of from the text inset (`control_inset`), which had
shrunk it to a ~6px glyph adrift in the 28px control plate (the "tiny icon"
defect); it is the one `lib/controls` icon-button paint path, so every icon-only
button across the desktop benefits. Host tests: the `lib/browse`
permission-toggle non-overlap regression + hit-test scan, and the
`lib/controls` `icon_only_glyph_fills_the_plate_not_the_text_inset` regression;
freestanding app builds + lints clean.

**FM16 — glass.** A browser window is drawn on `MANAGER_WINDOW_GROUND`, the
frosted window ground: the listing's ground is translucent over the blur the
window asks for before its first frame and on every desktop change, while its
overlays, the "Open With…" chooser and the Properties windows keep the opaque
theme (`tairix_theme::Grounds`, shared with Settings).

**FM17 — no blank band.** A browser window's height ceiling is what its
listing and rail fill at its width (`render::fitted_height`, declared through
`fitted_sizing`), restated whenever that moves; the window manager holds the
window to a restated range, so a shrinking listing brings the window down and
a drag or maximize stops at the listing. It opens at that height, up to the
ordinary browser height (`manager_opening`, which the QEMU reconstruction
shares), measured from the listing `first_listable` already read, and a move
to another folder fits it afresh without undoing a height its user gave it.
A listing still being read changes nothing.

**FM18 — one row, and a bar that stays.** A browser window's floor is one
whole row of its listing beneath the bands it draws (`browser_floor`,
`render::listing_floor_height`) — a line of tiles in the grid or a row in the
list, under the command band when it shows — which is exactly what a one-row
listing fills. The window restates it with the ceiling whenever its view or
bands change, and the window manager holds a drag in flight to the range as it
is restated (`InputRouter::restate_resize`), so narrowing a window raises its
ceiling and the same drag can take it taller. The listing's bar is drawn beside
the "Listing…" cue as beside any listing that fits, its thumb resting the
track's length, and the cue lays out no entry, so nothing undrawn can be
pressed, scrolled to or probed. A Properties window keeps its own floor
(`properties_sizing`).

**FM19 — a listing that follows the folder.** Each listing is read through a
descriptor armed with a directory watch before the read
(`docs/src/filesystem/watch.md`), so no change falls between the two; the
reader worker drains each report, and the window merges it in place
(`Browser::apply_changes`), keeping the focus and selection on their entries
and repainting only the rows `render::listing_damage` reports. A reload keeps
them too, and a folder's occupancy cue is kept while it is probed again, so
nothing blinks. A report waits while a menu, an inline rename or a drag holds
the listing; a rescan reads the folder again; a folder gone from its path is
left for its parent. New Folder opens its rename once the listing shows the
folder. A watch the kernel refuses leaves the listing correct but not live,
and says so.

**FM-dialogs — the two popup surfaces.** Three defects, one of them shared
with every other surface on the desktop.

*The empty buttons.* `lib/controls`' plate content was charged `control_inset`
as a **vertical** budget and withheld entirely when the plate was shorter than
twice it. That threshold is 22px at the reference density, which is exactly
`render::row_height` — so every button in both dialogs, laid out on the text
row pitch, drew as a bare plate with no label at all. The inset is a
*horizontal* text budget (it exceeds what the theme's own `control_height` can
spare vertically); the vertical budget is now the plate less the frame, with
the content centred and clipped like every other blit. Both dialogs also now
reserve `control_height` for their action bands, not a text row pitch, through
the one shared `render::control_height`.

That same budget was sizing the glyph of an *icon-and-label* plate, which on
the 28px control plate left a 6px glyph beside 18px type — the "tiny icon"
defect `icon_content_side` had already fixed for icon-*only* plates, still
present in this arm and fixed by the same change. Every surface with an
icon-and-label button benefits; the regression test measures the glyph by
differencing two icons under one label, since differencing against a
label-only plate moves the label and measures that instead.

*The inert chooser.* `files.app`'s `route_event` resolved an event's window id
against its window list alone. The chooser is a popup pane held inside the
browser window's overlays, not a list member, so **every** key, click, scroll
and redraw addressed to it was dropped — the popup opened, painted once, and
never responded again. The session focuses a popup when it opens, so those
events do arrive naming the popup. Resolution now goes through the pure,
host-tested `route::addressee`, which reports the window *and which of its two
surfaces* was named: a popup's events go to the chooser, and never to its owner
(an undistinguished match would have resized, released or closed the manager
window instead). The reciprocal interception in `apply_event` — which fed the
*parent* window's events to the chooser — is gone: it resolved parent-local
coordinates against the popup's viewport, which could land on Open and launch
an application the user never picked.

*Two more defects the review found.* `properties_hit` resolved the ownership
cell with **no** `can_chown` gate while the draw only drew the control when the
capability was held — so a session without `CAP_FS_CHOWN` could click where the
undrawn value sat and open an editor for a change the kernel could only refuse.
The hit-test now takes the same gate the draw took, so it resolves exactly what
was painted (the kernel always enforced the write, so this was a fail-open UI,
not an escalation). And sectioning the window left the *attribute* keyboard
live on every section — typing on General filled a field the user could not
see, an arrow moved an invisible cursor and paid for a repaint, and `Escape`
cleared a hidden line instead of closing the window. `route::properties_key`
is now the one host-tested statement of which part of the window a key acts on.

*The design.* Both windows now open with one shared identity band
(`render::Identity` / `draw_identity`) — the node's own artwork at 48 logical
pixels, its name in `TextRole::ItemTitle`, and a muted detail line — so the
subject of a window is named once at the top rather than as a row among its
fields, and neither surface carries its own copy. Properties is then a
`lib/controls` `Tabs` strip over the closed `render::PropertiesTab`
vocabulary (General / Permissions / Attributes) and the selected section's
body; `render::Field::tab` is the one definition of which section a field
belongs to, and `Left`/`Right` walk the strip while it holds the keyboard.
The frame is resolved from the
**client alone**, never the node, so an alias row no longer moves every band
below it — the same click meant different things on a link and a plain file.
The Permissions section is composed of the shared form family (FM8b), and
each ownership id's editable cell is a pressable plate — an idle `TextField`
drew identically to the live editor over it, so a reader could not tell
whether their keys were landing. The metadata rows are a
`lib/controls` `FactList` in both the window's General section and the trusted
picker's panel, which deleted the hand-rolled two-column `FieldLayout`. The
chooser draws each candidate's **own** application icon (it resolved through
`NoArtwork`, so every row wore the same generic glyph), marks the candidate a
plain *Open* would have used, and takes a single press as a *pick* with a
double-click, `Enter` or **Open** as the activation — a press that launched at
once left the Open button with nothing to do and spawned an application on a
mis-click.

Still a single `key = value` line rather than separate key and value fields:
the shared `tairix_fsmeta::attr::parse_assignment` grammar backs it and the
placeholder states the spelling, so the split is a refinement rather than a
defect, and is not smuggled into this change.

**Chrome layout, the default view, and the modal cancel rect.** The command
toolbar is *window* chrome: its band spans the full window width
(`render::toolbar_bounds`, and the three hit-tests that invert it —
`toolbar_command_at`, `manager_tool_at`, `manager_tool_rect` — take the
window), and `render::sidebar_view` insets the places rail's top by that band,
so the rail's first row top *is* the first listing row's top and its rows share
the `row_height` grid with the listing rows beside them. `content_area` keeps
its meaning as the window less the rail — what the item view, scrollbar
and overlays occupy — so the picker (no rail, `content_area` == window) is
laid out exactly as before. The manager opens on `ViewMode::Grid` (icons)
with the toolbar toggle switching to the list; the engine default and the
read-only picker stay `List`, since a chooser needs names, sizes and dates.
The modal file-operation progress panel's Cancel press resolves through the
same `content_area` the panel is painted in — the routing lives in the
host-testable `userland/apps/files/src/operation.rs`, which takes the window
plus the drawn rail and derives the panel rect itself, so a caller cannot hand
it the wrong rectangle (it previously hit-tested the whole window, so a press
on the drawn button missed by the rail's width). Host tests: the `lib/browse`
chrome-geometry set (toolbar band spans the window, a press at `x == 0` in the
band resolves to the first enabled command, the rail's row grid, no rail row
above the band, degenerate windows total) and the `operation` cancel-routing
set (a press on the drawn button cancels; the same y over the rail does not).

**Both chrome bands are off by default, and are the user's to turn on.** A
window opens showing the listing alone: neither the places rail nor the
command toolbar reserves any of it. `chrome::ToolbarBand` (`Shown`/`Hidden`)
is threaded through every measurement of the listing and every hit-test that
inverts one, beside the `Option<&Places>` that already said whether a rail is
drawn — so `chrome_height` is zero, `sidebar_view` starts the rail at the top
of the window, and `toolbar_bounds` yields *no* rectangle rather than a flat
one (the shared `Toolbar` lays its buttons out from whatever origin it is
given, so a zero-height band would have resolved a press on the window's top
row against a strip nothing painted — fail closed). `userland/apps/files`
holds the pair per window as `chrome::Chrome`, defaulting to `Chrome::HIDDEN`,
and a window showing no rail routes nothing to one.

`F9` shows or hides the rail and `Ctrl+F9` the toolbar. These are what keep
every command the toolbar carries reachable while it is hidden — the view
toggle, the sort cycle, and the Trash tools have no keyboard equivalent of
their own — until the desktop settings application sets the same two fields
from the user's stored preference (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md`); the
accelerators stay afterwards, as the in-window spelling of the setting. The
read-only picker is unchanged: `ManagerChrome::none()` still carries
`ToolbarBand::Shown`, and `picker::PICKER_CHROME` names it once so the painted
band and the hit-tests that invert it cannot disagree.

**FM12 (pointer activation gestures)**: four gestures reach the one `activate`
dispatch a keyboard `Enter` uses (so pointer and keyboard never diverge, §2.2)
— double-click (activate), shift-double-click (list a bundle rather than run
it), and right-click (which asks the desktop for the context menu; its **Open
and Close** row activates and then closes
the window once the entry is handed over). The pairing is the shared pure
`lib/browse::click::DoubleClickTracker` over the capability-free monotonic
clock, keyed on the **button** as well as the item so one press of each is two
gestures begun, never one completed. Which gesture a press is comes from the
app's own pure, host-tested `gesture` module (`bundle_intent`,
`primary_press`, `secondary_press`, `AfterHandoff`), mirroring how `command`
keeps the freestanding binary's decisions testable; `apply_primary_press` /
`apply_secondary_press` are then thin routers, and the tracker is reset on any
tool/chrome press so a click through the chrome and back never mis-pairs. The
shift modifier arrives on the pointer event itself (`WindowEvent::Pointer`'s
`modifiers`, stamped by the seat from the `KeyInput::ModifiersChanged` edges the
keyboard drivers now report) — a modifier key reaches no surface as a key, so
an app could not otherwise know one is held. FM1–FM11
remain landed, including **FM11c (the empty-Trash QEMU
witness)**: the aarch64 `autoload_input` vertical now proves the empty-Trash
click-through end to end (after FM10's move-to-Trash `op=rename`, the runner
clicks Go to Trash → Empty Trash → confirm *Delete Permanently*, and the guest
PASS latches an eleventh witness — `FsNodeMutated op=rmdir` whose `path` is
under `Library/Trash`, gated on the move having latched via the one-shot
`FM11_TRASH_FILLED_MARKER`, so no earlier removal can satisfy it — fail
closed). **FM11b lands the app-side Empty Trash
verb + the navigable Trash view.** Two manager-only toolbar tools join the
`chrome::ManagerTool` set (drawn only for the write-capable file manager): **Go
to Trash** (`ManagerTool::Trash`) navigates the browser to the user's
`Library/Trash` via the new `Browser::navigate_to` jump-to-arbitrary-location
primitive, and **Empty Trash** (`ManagerTool::EmptyTrash`) — enabled only in a
non-empty Trash via the new `chrome::ManagerToolModel` threaded through
`render`/`manager_tool_at` — builds `empty_trash_plan`, confirms with the
`DeleteDisposition::Permanent` dialog, and drives the plan's `DeleteWalk`
through the same interleaved progress/cancel runner a delete uses
(`ProgressOp::Delete`). Each tool carries a new built-in `lib/icon` glyph
(`IconKind::Trash` / `IconKind::EmptyTrash`). Host-tested in `lib/browse`
(`navigate_to` off-spine/no-op/fail-closed; the Empty Trash enable-gate
hit-test) and `lib/icon`; the freestanding files app builds + lints clean.
**FM11a — the pure empty-Trash model.** `lib/browse::trash::empty_trash_plan` turns the Trash
directory's `fs_readdir` listing into a `delete::DeletePlan` over its *contents*
(never the Trash directory itself, so emptying leaves the now-empty folder in
place), carried out by the same recursive `DeleteWalk` a permanent delete uses
(no second removal engine, §2.2). Emptying is always permanent, so the app
confirms it with `DeleteDisposition::Permanent`; it returns `None` for an
already-empty Trash (a no-op the app just does not offer, never an error) and is
fail closed — a root Trash dir (`RootTrash`) or an invalid child leaf
(`InvalidName`) refuses the whole empty rather than remove outside Trash or
silently skip an item (§5.4). It touches no filesystem and holds no authority
(the app drives the plan with its own `fs_readdir`/`fs_unlink` under the user's
identity), so composing it grants nothing and the read-only picker never builds
one. Host-tested in `lib/browse` (contents-not-the-dir removal, empty=no-op,
root-trash refusal, invalid-child refusal). Now justified rather than
speculative: the move that fills the Trash (FM10) has landed, so the way back to
a permanent removal is real surface (§2.4). **FM11c's witness**: the
end-to-end empty-Trash click-through on the aarch64 `autoload_input` QEMU
vertical latches a new eleventh witness (`FsNodeMutated op=rmdir` under
`Library/Trash`, gated after the FM10 move via the one-shot
`FM11_TRASH_FILLED_MARKER`). **FM10 (recoverable delete:
move to Trash).** FM10a is the pure `lib/browse::trash` model
(`trash_strategy` same-volume-move-vs-unlink + collision-safe `trash_dest_path`);
**FM10b is the app-side Trash verb and its QEMU witness.** On a confirmed
delete the `files.app` `Run` binary resolves the user's home from the exported
`HOME`, ensures the fixed `Library/Trash` subtree (shared `trash::trash_dir`),
and — when Trash and every target share a volume — carries the removal out as a
recoverable **move to Trash** (`Job::Trash`: one `fs_rename` per target into its
collision-free `trash_dest_path`, driven by the same interleaved
progress/cancel runner), falling back fail-closed to the irreversible
`DeleteWalk` unlink when Trash is unavailable or cross-volume. The confirmation
`Dialog` is disposition-aware (`DeleteDisposition` threaded into the shared
`render::build_delete_dialog`): a recoverable *Move to Trash* vs an irreversible
*Delete Permanently*, so the wording always matches what will happen (§2.24).
The desktop session now forwards the **user environment** (incl. `HOME`) to its
launched apps (`spawn_app` → `spawn_with`), the prerequisite that lets the file
manager locate the per-user Trash. The aarch64 `autoload_input` QEMU vertical's
tenth witness changed from `FsNodeMutated op=rmdir` to `op=rename` with a
destination under `Library/Trash` (still gated after the FM9-b `fd_redeem`, so
no earlier mutation can satisfy it — fail closed). **FM1, FM2a, FM2b, FM3, FM4a, FM4b's pure chrome model,

`Job::Delete` `DeleteWalk` or a `Job::Paste` state machine — the event loop
drives a bounded slice at a time, drawing the shared `lib/browse::progress`

children reaped on an any-child wait-set member),
and FM4b's context menu (a secondary-button press asks the desktop's own menu
service to open the rows `chrome::context_menu` declares from the shared
`ContextMenuModel`, routed through
`dispatch_context_command` to the *same* Open/Rename/Cut/Copy/Paste/Properties
verbs the toolbar and keyboard drive, fail-closed on a disabled row or a press
off the menu)
are done** — completing FM4b's drawn chrome and all of FM7b's app-side verbs,
plus **FM6b's app-side `OpenFile` hand-off** (opening a data file in its
associated viewer via the inherited-document `DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` + `STDIN`
spawn-time hand-off, with the viewer's own inherited-document startup path and
the signed `AppInfo` MIME associations that resolve the viewer), and
**FM6b's explicit "Open With…" chooser** (`OpenWith` re-joins the context menu
for a regular file; the app's own scrolled `OpenWithChooser` list offers the
full `applications_for` result and launches the picked bundle through the same
`DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG`+`STDIN` hand-off, where the default open picks the first).
**FM9-pre** (the `FsNodeMutated`/
`FsMutationDenied` filesystem-mutation audit events every write syscall emits,
a §5.4/§19.4 requirement in their own right and the robust serial witnesses a
mutation vertical keys on). **FM9-b is now complete, app side and guest side.
FM9-a and FM9-c are app-side only: their product halves are landed, and their
guest click-throughs are partly delivered and partly blocked, as below.**

**FM9-a — what is true.** The *product* half: `render::selection_name_rect`
for rows, the forward `render::manager_tool_rect` over `Toolbar::tool_rect` for
the New Folder tool, and the inline-rename commit. The *guest* half is
`tests/integration/fsmutate_qemu_aarch64`, a
dedicated vertical that reaches the **create** through the *desktop backdrop's*
own New Folder row and latches `FsNodeMutated` `op=mkdir` attributed by the
created path — the first mutation record any guest run in the tree has ever
produced. Two parts remain blocked on `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D98 (the harness
cannot order a typed key after a pointer click): the **rename** commit, which
needs typing sequenced after the click that opens the editor, and the
**toolbar** gesture itself, because a files window opens with
`Chrome::HIDDEN` and the New Folder tool is reachable only after `Ctrl+F9`
reveals the band (or via `Ctrl+Shift+N`) — neither key being expressible by a
harness that injects characters. `manager_tool_rect` therefore has no caller
yet, tracked as D99.

What is no longer missing is the *geometry*: a gesture into a file-manager
window is reconstructible host-side (`reconstruct_manager_item_click` — the
session's own cascade placement, the compositor's furniture band, and the
engine's content-area and item-rect over the listing the guest holds, with the
opening presentation read from `lib/browse`'s `MANAGER_VIEW_MODE` /
`MANAGER_TOOLBAR_BAND`). The three-principal hand-over vertical
(`plans/VIEW.md`) is its first consumer, activating a real item in a real
manager window through that item's own context-menu *Open* row
(`reconstruct_manager_item_menu`, which composes the session's chain from the
rows this app declares). D98 remains the block on FM9-a's remaining halves, and
it is a block on *keys*, not on reaching the window.
Landed: the trusted picker opens at the user's `UserFiles` (`Browser::open_at`
over the session's `HOME`, climbing from a refused start), and the CU6 one-shot delegation
that hands the picked file to the viewer is host-tested end to end (mint, the
D92 instance gate, one-shot redemption, the grantor-identity re-check, the
extent ceiling). **The guest run now exists**:
`tests/integration/filepick_qemu_aarch64`, a dedicated vertical rather than a
stage on the aarch64 `autoload_input` vertical, which would have inherited its
open intermittency (D15). It launches `view` from the program-library row,
waits for the picker to be on screen, and clicks the planted document's row;
its guest PASS is `SyscallInvoked` `sc=fd_grant` from `comm=desktop` followed by
`sc=fd_redeem` from `comm=view`, attributing each half to the principal the
kernel says made the call so the run states a hand-off *between* processes.

Two of this section's earlier premises were wrong and are corrected here. The
viewer bundle **is** already on every fixture image — the image build discovers
it from the userland walk, and its manifest's `library` category already makes
it a popup row — so no fixture change was needed. And the session **can**
emit a record: `DESKTOP_REVEALED`, `WINDOW_SHOWN` and `MENU_SHOWN` already
reach the serial transcript through `tairix_rt::LogSink`.

The pick-click gate is therefore not the test-kernel `fs_open` marker this
section proposed, which measurement showed unsound: the session emits 43
`comm=desktop sc=fs_open` records per run, 10 of them *after* a library launch,
and the picker's listing is read on a worker (`Listing::Pending`) so no single
read means "ready to click". Instead the session announces the fact itself —
`PICKER_SHOWN`, one-shot per pick and only once `Browser::is_listing()` is
false — the sibling of `MENU_SHOWN` for the other surface no channel reports.
Closed as `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D94. **FM9-c (delete with confirm) stands as
product; its guest click-through is not** — no vertical drives a delete or a
context menu, and it is blocked with FM9-a's remaining halves on
`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D98. A clickable **Delete** joins the context menu (its
`begin_delete` action already existed, so this is not speculative surface,
§2.4), routed through `dispatch_context_command` to the same confirm-and-remove
verb the `Delete` key opens. Delivering the right-click needed a real compositor
fix that also makes the *whole* context menu usable in the desktop: the
secondary (right) button was **dropped** — `tairix_wm`'s router ignored it and
the desktop session's router had a catch-all that swallowed it. Now the WM
router raises+focuses and returns `InputResponse::SecondaryActivated`, the
session forwards `PointerPressed {Secondary}`, and the session delivers
`WindowEvent::Pointer Pressed(Secondary)` to the app (host-tested in
`tairix-wm` and `tairix-desktop-session`). The earlier "the injected
right-click never arrives" was a `tools/qemu` harness bug (QEMU's HMP
`mouse_button` help string mislabels the state bits — `0x2` is right, `0x4` is
middle — so the harness sent a right-press as the *middle* button); the
`MouseButton::mask_bit` fix sends `0x2` and the dedicated
`pointer_button_virtio_mmio_qemu_aarch64` vertical proves it (`BTN_RIGHT`,
fails-before/passes-after). **One QEMU vertical now clicks this app's context
menu**: the hand-over vertical (`plans/VIEW.md`) right-presses an item and
clicks the plate's *Open* row, reconstructing the desktop's chain
(`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` M3.3 — the plates are the session's own surfaces) from
the rows this app declares, and gating that click on the `MENU_SHOWN` record
that says a plate reached the display. The session's chain is additionally
driven end to end by `tests/integration/menu_qemu_aarch64`, which photographs
the plate at the rectangle the production chain reports. The menu's *other*
verbs (Rename/Cut/Copy/Paste/Properties/Delete) are still unreached by any
vertical, blocked with FM9-a's remaining halves on D98. The starting point was
`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3/AW5 (done): the
`files.app` `Run` binary composes the shared `lib/browse` `Browser` model +
`render` renderer over the AW2 window channel, parks on its event mailbox, and
navigates by keyboard; the renderer-mirroring point hit-test
(`render::entry_index_at`) and the kernel one-shot read delegation
(`fd_grant`/`fd_redeem`) the viewer consumes are in place.

FM2 was split (§2.19) into FM2a (the list item view) and FM2b (the icon-grid
view, the runtime view toggle, and the drawn `ScrollBar`); both are done. FM4 is
split the same way: **FM4a** (the engine navigation model — the bounded
back/forward history); **FM4b** paints that model as drawn
chrome. Its **drawn clickable
toolbar** — its commands (Back/Forward/Up/Refresh/ToggleView/
Sort) and their actions already exist, so it needs no speculative surface. The
**drawn context menu is now done** — a secondary-button press paints the shared
`ContextMenuModel` as a `lib/controls::Menu` routed to the existing
Open/Rename/Cut/Copy/Paste/Properties verbs; `OpenWith` **now re-joins**
`CONTEXT_COMMANDS` with FM6b's chooser verb (enabled only for a regular file),
and **Delete** joined it with FM9-c's confirm-and-remove verb (enabled on any
selection). New ▸ (Folder and the blank documents, `plans/FILES-INTERACTION.md`
FI10) is a submenu of it; the read-only picker opens no write menu.

FM6 is split (§2.19) the same way: **FM6a** (the engine `activate` dispatch-by-kind
decision — descend / launch a bundle / open a file, host-proven), and
so now is **FM6b's pure type→bundle "open with" association model** (the
`lib/browse::open_with` module — the `BundleSource` enumeration seam and
`applications_for` over the shared `lib/browse::media` content-type registry,
host-proven like FM6a). **FM6b's app-side bundle launch is now done too**: `Enter` on the
selection dispatches through `Browser::activate_selected`, and a `LaunchBundle`
spawns the `<Name>.app` bundle's own `Run` through the ordinary signed load
gate under the `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` grant this stage added (async and
non-blocking, with launched children reaped on an any-child wait-set member).
**Handing a data file to its associated viewer (`OpenFile`) is now done too**:
`Activation::OpenFile` resolves the viewer from the installed bundles' signed
`AppInfo` MIME associations (`RtBundleSource` + `applications_for`), opens the
file read-only in its own table, and **offers it to a live instance first**
through the desktop's single-instance funnel
(`WindowRequest::HandOverLaunch` with a `Document`): the grant is minted from
that descriptor to the session, which relays it on to the resident instance, so
a bundle declaring one instance opens a second window rather than a second
process. Anything but `Reached` — no instance, one that could not be reached, a
session with no funnel — spawns as before, handing the file over through the
race-free spawn-time inheritance (`spawn_attached` with the descriptor wired
onto the child's `STDIN`, `FdWire::Handle`, plus the reserved
`DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` token). Either way the viewer reads its document with no
filesystem capability of its own, and a bundle launch (`LaunchBundle`) goes
through the same funnel with no document. This supersedes the earlier
fd_grant-after-spawn sketch. **The
explicit "Open With…" chooser over the full `applications_for` result is now
done too** — the default open picks the first association, the chooser lets the
user pick any. See FM6b below.

## 0. Scope and decisions (binding for this plan)

- **One engine, two consumers, no divergence (§2.2).** All navigation,
  selection, layout, hit-testing, and file-operation *modelling* lives in
  the shared `lib/browse` crate (`tairix-browse`) — the same engine the
  desktop session's trusted CU6 file picker (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW5)
  drives. The `files.app` `Run` binary stays "only the program": it wires
  syscalls to the engine and paints; it never grows a private copy of a
  behaviour the picker also needs. A capability the picker must *not* have
  (write/delete) is gated in the app's own privileged tail, not by forking
  the engine.

- **The window's reads run off its loop** (`AGENTS.md` §28). Every unbounded read
  the app makes runs on one reader thread: the directory the user navigated to
  (through `ListingDesk<FilesClient>`, committed by `Browser::resume`), the
  icon artwork every visible tile draws (recorded on `tairix_icon::ArtworkDesk`
  from inside the paint), the folder cue every visible folder draws (likewise
  recorded from inside the paint and answered a frame later, so the paint
  performs no I/O at all), and the three-program-store walk the *Open With…*
  chooser is built from. They share one worker rather than taking one each —
  the app browses one place at a time, so these are never concurrent workloads
  — and the sharing is what gives the order they are served in a single stated
  answer: the listing first (the user navigated and is waiting), then the
  artwork (which the listing's own tiles are drawn from), then the cues (which
  decorate a listing already shown), then the bundle scan (which no frame
  depends on). Nothing starves: each request set is finite and refilled only by
  the user asking again.
  - The one read left on the app's own task is `first_listable`, which answers
    *which* location to open — a question a deferred source cannot answer,
    since its first answer is always "not yet" and every candidate would look
    listable. The first window's read comes before any window exists; a later
    window's is taken on the loop (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D454).
  - The rename's move runs on the reader thread too; the other writes — New ▸'s
    create, the Properties commits, the Trash folder, and each step of a
    delete, paste or move to Trash — are still taken on the loop
    (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D815).
  - A kernel that grants no thread, or a pipe it refuses, leaves the reads on
    the loop, stated once: slower under load, never wrong.

- **The app is its own process with its own bounded authority (§4, §5.2).**
  `files.app` holds exactly its manifest ∩ ceiling set: `CAP_FS_ACCESS`
  (read/list) + `CAP_SHM` + `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE`, plus `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` (added
  in FM6b, the stage that first launches a bundle). Write-side
  operations (rename/move/copy/delete/mkdir) are ordinary §5.3-checked VFS
  calls under the launching user's own identity — they need **no new
  capability**: the per-inode owner/mode/ACL model already gates them, and
  a refused write fails closed with a stated reason (§2.24), never a
  fabricated success. Launching another app is the `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` request
  added to the manifest **only** in the stage (FM6b) that first uses it,
  never ahead of it (§2.4); the child still loads through the ordinary signed
  load gate and runs as the launching user (no ambient authority).

- **No ambient authority; every operation is the user's own (§4, §5.4).**
  The file manager performs a write only through a path the user directly
  acted on (selected + invoked). There is no daemon doing work on the
  user's behalf with wider authority, no setuid, no "run as system". A
  drag-drop move is the same authorised `fs_rename`/copy the user could
  type; the GUI is a spelling of the user's intent, not an escalation.

- **Coherent UI, zero bloat (§2.3, best-in-class mandate).** One window,
  one consistent layout, built entirely from `lib/controls` widgets over
  the shared theme (`lib/theme`) — a toolbar, one
  scrollable item view (list *or* icon-grid, a view toggle, not two
  code paths), a selection model, and a small honest set of operations.
  No ribbon, no modal-dialog maze: the one surface that is a window of its
  own is Properties, because a user comparing two nodes needs two of them and
  the listing must stay usable while they are open. Every action
  is discoverable from the toolbar/context-menu and has a keyboard
  equivalent. A feature earns its place or it is not built (§2.3).

- **Destructive actions are honest and reversible where cheap (§2.24).**
  Delete asks once (a `lib/controls` `Dialog` with honest action warmth),
  reports refusals in-UI (a denied delete is an answer, not a crash), and
  — where the backing supports it cheaply — prefers a recoverable move to
  a per-user trash location over an irreversible unlink (staged FM7).

- **Fail closed, park never poll, no busy loops (§5.4, §2.23).** The event
  loop parks on the wait-set exactly as today; a long copy is chunked and
  interruptible and never spins; a refused listing/operation leaves the
  view exactly where it was (the `lib/browse` transactional discipline).

- **Not in this plan:** the compositor window furniture
  (`plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md`), display acceleration
  (`plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md`), the storage-namespace resolver
  internals (`docs/src/filesystem/drives.md`), and network/remote volumes.
  This plan consumes those surfaces; it does not build them.

## 1. Stages

Each stage is one fully-gated increment: it lands with its host tests, its
docs, and a green whole-project validation gate (§7), and — where the
behaviour is observable end-to-end — extends the autoload QEMU vertical
rather than a faked run (§2.1). The engine work (FM1–FM3, FM7 modelling)
is host-proven in `lib/browse` against injected sources exactly as the AW1
model was; the app work (painting, click routing, spawn) rides the desktop
autoload vertical the AW3/AW5 interaction contract already drives.

### FM1 — richer entries: metadata, kinds, and a stable sort

`lib/browse::Entry` now carries `size: u64` and `modified: Time64`
alongside its name and kind, mapped straight from the existing `fs_readdir`
`DirEntry` stream (no new syscall); a bad record still refuses the *whole*
listing (§5.4). `EntryKind` gained a `Bundle` variant — a `<Name>.app`
directory is a sealed unit, so `Entry::is_directory` is `false` for it and
`Browser::open_index` refuses to descend; the engine only models the
distinction (FM6 owns the launch). `EntryKind::for_listing` / `is_bundle_name`
are the one pure classifier both views share. `lib/browse::sort` adds
`SortMode` (`SortKey` name/size/modified × `SortDirection`) and the pure
`sort_entries` — directories first, then the key, with an alloc-free
case-insensitive name tiebreak; the `Browser` applies it to every listing and
`set_sort_mode` re-orders in place keeping the selection on the same entry
(default: name-ascending). Host-tested in `lib/browse/src/tests.rs` (metadata
mapping/refuse, `is_bundle_name`, bundle-not-descendable, the three sort keys +
direction + empty, `set_sort_mode` selection-preserve); the order-dependent
existing tests were updated to the sorted order. Docs:
`docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md`. No app-behaviour change
(the app repaints in FM2).

Deliberately deferred to a later stage (not FM1): a `Symlink`/`Special`
variant is added only when the VFS surfaces such a kind (a new variant, never
overloading the existing ones).

### FM2a — the list item view over `lib/controls`

The ad-hoc row painter in `lib/browse::render` is replaced with a real
list item view built from the shared collection controls, so the manager and
the trusted picker share one coherent, themed surface (§2.2, §17.4). No app-
behaviour change: the `files.app`/picker `render` and `entry_index_at`
signatures are unchanged, so both get the new look for free.

- **List view**: each entry is a `lib/controls` `TableRow` with a leading
  name cell (a directory suffixed `/`), a trailing numeric size cell, and a
  modified-date cell; the selected row carries the shared row chrome's
  selection state (raised surface + accent selection rail), not a browser-
  private accent fill. The column layout is one definition (`render::COLUMNS`),
  scaled proportionally into the content width by `TableRow::render`.
- **Item-view geometry** (`lib/browse::layout::ListView`): the one pure
  definition of where each row is laid out, unscrolled, which rows a pixel
  scroll shows any part of, and the point→index hit-test through the scrolled
  view, built on the shared `lib/controls` `scroll::ScrollRange` clamp rather
  than a re-derived anchor. Both `render` (paint) and `entry_index_at`
  (hit-test) consume it, so they can never disagree (§2.2).
- **Column formatting** (`lib/browse::format`): `format_size` (binary units)
  and `format_date` (`Time64` → ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, blank at the epoch so a
  stampless file is never given a fabricated date, §21) — the file-listing
  convention shared by both views, deliberately distinct from the `top`/
  `sysinfo` figure spellings in `lib/procinfo` (a browser engine does not
  depend on the System Information client crate).
- Host tests: `format` size/date (bytes, binary scaling, huge-size no-overflow,
  epoch-blank, pre-1970/post-2038, leap day); `layout` (visible window excludes
  the header, degenerate viewport/zero row height show nothing, row rects and
  the mirroring hit-test at every offset, including part-way through a row,
  the least-pixel reveal, the `ScrollRange` offset clamp); the render
  selection-chrome assertion.

### FM2b — the icon-grid view, the view toggle, and the drawn `ScrollBar`

The engine now owns a `ViewMode` (`List`/`Grid`) and a single scroll
offset, and both views land complete (§27) behind one `layout::ViewLayout`
dispatch that the renderer and the pointer hit-test share (§2.2):

- **Two views, one model.** `layout::ListView` (full-width rows) and
  `layout::GridView` (a wrapped grid of `lib/controls` `IconTile` items — a
  picture over its name, no plate per entry) take an explicit scroll offset and
  share one `reveal` rule + the `scroll::ScrollRange` clamp.
  `Browser::set_view_mode` toggles the view keeping the selection on the same
  entry and re-reading nothing; the picture above each grid tile's label is FM3
  (the tile is complete without it here).
- **A grid line holds only whole tiles and spreads its leftover width**
  (`tairix_geometry::GridFill::Spread`, the policy a *resizable* view takes): no tile is
  cut across its line, and the width left over once the row has fitted as many
  whole tiles as it can is shared out along it — the gaps widen by equal amounts
  and the two end margins match — so widening the window spreads the row until
  one more tile fits and then re-flows into the extra column. Only the space
  between tiles moves: a tile never stretches, so its picture slot, label field,
  and hit target read the same at every window size, and a part-filled last row
  still lines up with the rows above it. The pitch is the floor (an exact fit is
  laid out identically under either policy) and the *scroll* axis is never
  spread — the rows follow one another at their pitch and the view is a pixel
  window onto them, so the row its edge crosses is drawn whole and cut there,
  one scroll from whole. Both views are laid out unscrolled at their natural
  size and painted through their `ScrollView`, confined to the item area, so
  nothing an item draws can encroach on the scrollbar gutter or the chrome. The
  desktop's fixed icon field takes `FixedPitch` instead, keeping its icons
  anchored to the edge they hug, and never scrolls.
- **Scrolling** is the drawn `lib/controls` `ScrollBar` in a reserved
  right-edge gutter over that same `ScrollRange`, in pixels. The wheel's scroll
  units move the listing a fixed distance a detent through the browser's own
  bar (`render::scroll_wheel`), which carries what is short of a pixel to the
  next turn; the bar's own presses and drags route through
  `render::scroll_pointer`; and a selection-moving key reveals the selection
  whole, moving the least it can (`render::reveal_selection`). The browser
  holds the one `ScrollColumn` both the bar and the views read.
- **Hit-testing** is `render::entry_index_at`, a point (x, y) test through
  `ViewLayout` that resolves list rows and grid tiles alike, rejecting the
  header, the inter-tile gaps, the spread row's end margins, and the scrollbar
  gutter. It inverts exactly the arithmetic that placed each tile, so a click
  can only ever land on the tile the user saw. The picker adopts it.
- Host-tested in `lib/browse` (list + grid layout/hit-test at degenerate and
  normal sizes and part-way through a row or a line of tiles — the cut item
  drawn whole and found where it shows — the least-pixel `reveal`, the
  view-toggle selection-preserve, the wheel's detent, carry and clamp and the
  damage it reports, and the drawn scrollbar thumb tracking the offset). Docs:
  `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md`.

### FM3 — file-type icons

`lib/icon::IconKind` gained the file-manager kinds `Folder`,
`FolderOpen`, `File` (generic), `AppBundle`, `Text`, `Image`, `Archive`, and
`Executable`, each a built-in vector glyph on the shared 24-unit design grid
resolved (like every kind) through the SVG-first theme-asset path, with
`Generic` the fail-closed fallback (§2.9). `IconSet` was refactored to store
one slot per kind indexed by the new `IconKind::index`, so adding a kind is a
new `ICON_KINDS` entry rather than a new field (§2.2); `builtin()` stays
`const`. The existing audio `Volume` glyph is left as-is: reusing an audio
speaker for a *storage* volume would be a semantic defect, so a storage-volume
icon is deferred to the stage that actually draws one, not forced onto the
audio kind here.

Kind→icon is `lib/browse::media::icon_for_entry(entry, parent)`, the one
classification both views draw through: the shared registry's glyph
(`media_for_entry(entry, parent).icon()`) — by `EntryKind` first
(directory→`inode/directory`→`Folder`, bundle→`application/x-tairix-service`
under the system service store and `application/x-tairix-app` elsewhere), then
a documented, ASCII-case-insensitive filename-extension table, with
`application/octet-stream`→`File` as the fallback for an
unknown/extensionless/dotfile name — except that a plain directory *known* to
hold something takes `FolderFilled` (see *Folder occupancy* below). One
classification shared by manager and
picker, and the same one the "Open With…" association reads (§2.2). It is a
display *hint* only; it gates no operation (authority stays in the VFS and the
launcher, §4/§5.4). The
picture is drawn by `lib/controls::IconTile`, the plateless icon-view item
(`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §11.34): a square picture slot over a centred,
truncated label, with hover/press/selection/focus/bead marks and nothing at all
behind a resting tile, and `render`'s grid tile sets its kind from the registry
— so the FM2b grid tile is complete. The tile takes the owner-supplied artwork
seam: `render`'s trailing `&mut dyn tairix_icon::IconArtwork` is asked for each
tile's kind at exactly the side its `TileLayout` reserves, and the tile
blits what it returns or draws the built-in glyph, so real icon artwork lands
without a second draw path.

**The decode is never on the event loop at all.** `crate::icons::IconPipeline`
is the manager's paint side: the shared reclaim-governed `ArtworkCache` bound to
the resolver its misses go to. That resolver is the reader thread's
`tairix_icon::ArtworkDesk`, the same deferred-decode desk the desktop session
uses (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md` DESK-8/DESK-12). A tile that misses records the
decode and draws its built-in glyph; the reader takes the job, reads and
decodes it with nothing held (in its **own** sandbox child, so no sandbox
handle crosses a thread), delivers, and nudges the loop once its artwork queue
drains — one whole-window pass per batch, because a present is a compositor
round trip and far dearer than the decode that produced one tile. The lock
carries only the desk: the cache stays on the paint side, since a picture is
handed out as a borrow into it and a borrow cannot outlive a guard. An answer
the cache took is forgotten by the desk, so an icon it later evicts is decoded
again rather than answered "not yet" for ever, and a band change re-offers what
the cache *refused* (the pressure wake's `IconPipeline::trim` plus the desk's
`retry_declined`). `draw_grid` asks only for the tiles on screen, so the desk
only ever holds the visible set and there is no second definition of "what is
on screen". A kernel that grants no reader thread leaves the read and the round
trip in the paint, exactly where they used to be. Host-tested in
`userland/apps/files/src/icons_tests.rs` (a paint performs no read and no
sandbox round trip, the reader delivers what the paint recorded, a decode in
flight is neither re-offered nor re-recorded, a delivery after teardown keeps
nothing, a retained decode is never produced twice, every tier's refusal
settles on the glyph, a declined decode is not re-asked until the band moves,
and a whole window's grid keeps every tile's artwork across repaints and a
scroll) — with the inline resolver's read-and-decode-in-the-paint cost pinned
beside them so those assertions cannot go vacuous.

The picker passes `NoArtwork`: it draws from built-in glyphs until it is given
a cache of its own.

Host-tested: `lib/icon` (the new glyphs draw, `index`↔`ICON_KINDS` round-trip,
`for_asset` mappings, per-kind SVG load/fallback over the full set),
`lib/controls` (a resting tile paints no plate/rim/panel over a backdrop in
either theme, hover vs selection vs press are distinct, focus draws the shared
ring, the bead states show, artwork blitted / glyph fallback / off-size artwork
centred, and nothing escapes the tile's bounds), and
`lib/browse` (the registry: every extension→type→icon row, spelling
round-trip, kind-before-extension, case-insensitivity,
unknown/extensionless/dotfile/trailing-dot → generic, last-extension-wins).

`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §11.34, `lib/icon`/`lib/browse` README + rustdoc.

#### Folder occupancy — an empty folder is not a full one

A folder that holds something draws a picture of what it holds — the folder
composite of its `FolderSample` (`plans/FILES-INTERACTION.md` FI11), or
`IconKind::FolderFilled` where that will not draw; an empty one keeps `Folder`.
A directory's `size` is `0` and no VFS surface reports a child count, so
occupancy is a separate read, and only a *known* answer changes the icon:

- `Entry::occupancy()` is `Unprobed` / `Empty` / `NonEmpty(sample)` /
  `Indeterminate` (refused or failed). Only `NonEmpty` changes the picture, so
  an unprobed or unreadable folder is the plain icon — fail closed, never a
  guess (§5.4).
- `DirectorySource::has_children` is the probe; `VfsDirectorySource` answers it
  by opening the directory, reading **one** `PROBE_BUF_LEN` batch, and closing
  — never a listing, never a walk. A batch costs the kernel what its buffer
  holds, so the cost does not grow with the child count.
- `Browser::resolve_occupancy(range)` — the shared `resolve_occupancy` the
  desktop resolves its icons through too — answers only the caller's indices,
  and only where an entry still needs one. The app passes
  `render::visible_range`, the one definition of what is on screen, so a
  100 000-entry directory probes a screenful (§26). A refusal is recorded,
  never retried; a fresh listing resets every answer, so a refresh re-probes.
  The deferred probe desk both share is `lib/browse` `Probes`.
- The trait's default answers `NotImplemented` (read as `Indeterminate`). The
  trusted picker takes that default deliberately: the cue adds nothing to
  choosing a file, so it exercises no directory-read authority it does not
  need.

Host-tested in `lib/browse` (empty vs occupied in both views, a refusal probed
exactly once, files and bundles never probed, a scroll-back issuing no second
probe, a reload re-probing, and a 100 000-entry listing bounded by the visible
window) and `lib/icon` (the new glyph and its shipped master). Docs:

### FM4a — the engine navigation model: history

The host-testable navigation *model* the FM4b chrome drives, added to
`lib/browse::Browser` (§2.2 — the picker gets it for free):

- **Navigation history**: a bounded back/forward stack (`go_back`/`go_forward`,
  with `can_go_back`/`can_go_forward` supplying the Back/Forward toolbar enable
  state). Every fresh navigation — descend, climb, or a jump to a location —
  records the directory it left on the back stack and clears the forward branch
  (standard browser semantics). The history is a bounded ring (`HISTORY_MAX`)
  that drops the *oldest* location rather than growing without bound: it is a
  UX convenience, not a hardware-scaled resource, so a deliberate defensive cap
  is the right shape (§24 — a bound, not a discovered capacity), and reaching
  it never fails a navigation.
- **Jump to a location**: `navigate_to(components)` reaches a directory that is
  neither an ancestor nor a listed child (the Trash tool uses it). Honours the
  storage-forest model — the root view is whatever the source lists (the four
  view bindings), never a fabricated POSIX tree
  (`docs/src/filesystem/drives.md`).
- Every one of these is the same transactional, fail-closed navigation as
  descend/climb: the target is listed *before* any state *or history* changes,
  so a move to a directory that has become unreadable leaves the browser and
  its history exactly where they were (§5.4).
- Host-tested in `lib/browse/src/tests.rs` (descend→back→forward, no-op on empty
  history, `go_up` records history, fresh-navigation clears forward,
  `go_back` transactional when the target
  becomes unreadable, and the bounded drop-oldest cap); `MockFs` gained a
  read-count-driven `deny_after_first` to model a revoked directory without a
  test-only source accessor. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
  `lib/browse/README.md`.

### FM4b — the drawn chrome: toolbar, context menu

The app frame, entirely `lib/controls`/`lib/browse::render` widgets over the
theme, painting the FM4a model. **A drawn surface lands with the action it
invokes** so no menu/toolbar entry is built ahead of the behaviour it calls
(§2.4) — the toolbar and context menu land with their verbs.

**There is no path bar.** The window title carries the current location
(`plans/APPWIN.md`), so a band of the window restating it would be a second
spelling of one fact (§2.2) and a row of listing the user does not get back.
`chrome_height` is therefore the toolbar strip alone, and the item view starts
directly beneath it.

**The pure chrome model** (§2.19 — host-proven ahead of the drawn
widgets, exactly as FM6a/FM6b/FM7a/FM7b's pure models landed): the
`lib/browse::chrome` module. `ToolbarModel::for_browser` snapshots which
`ToolbarCommand` (Back/Forward/Up/Refresh/ToggleView/Sort) is actionable —
Back/Forward/Up over `can_go_back`/`can_go_forward`/`!is_root`, the rest always
available — plus the active view/sort so a tool renders disabled, not hidden,
when it cannot apply; `TOOLBAR_COMMANDS` is the one command order the chrome
iterates.
Host-tested in `lib/browse` (toolbar enable/disable at root / after descend /
after go-back, the active-view/sort report, and the `TOOLBAR_COMMANDS` order).
Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The pure context-menu chrome model** (§2.19 — host-proven ahead of
the drawn menu, exactly as `ToolbarModel` landed ahead of the drawn toolbar):
`chrome::ContextMenuModel::for_browser(browser, has_clipboard)` +
`ContextCommand` + `CONTEXT_COMMANDS`. It reports which right-click command is
actionable: Open/Rename/Cut/Copy/Properties over the selection (an empty
directory offers none), Open With… over a regular file only (a directory
descends and a bundle launches itself, so neither has an app to choose), and
Paste over the app's held clipboard (threaded in, since the clipboard lives in
the app — `Browser::clipboard` *captures* one from the selection rather than
storing it). This is no longer speculative surface: every modelled command maps
to an engine action that already exists (§2.4). Delete and New Folder, whose
engine action does not exist yet, are deliberately absent from `CONTEXT_COMMANDS`
and land with the stage that first wires them. Host-tested in `lib/browse`
(no-selection disables the item commands, a directory enables all but Open
With…, a bundle disables Open With…, a file enables it, Paste tracks the
clipboard flag, and the `CONTEXT_COMMANDS` order/coverage). Docs:
`docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The drawn, clickable toolbar.** `render` paints `TOOLBAR_COMMANDS`
as a `lib/controls::Toolbar` of themed `IconButton`s in the top strip (each
glyph from the new `ToolbarCommand::icon()` — six new `lib/icon::IconKind`
glyphs NavBack/NavForward/NavUp/Refresh/ViewToggle/Sort), each enabled or
disabled from `ToolbarModel` (muted, never hidden). `render::toolbar_command_at`
is the strip's mirror hit-test returning **only an enabled command** (fail
closed); the app routes a primary-button press through it, then item
selection. Both the click and the keyboard accelerators run through
the one shared read-only `chrome::apply_command(browser, cmd)` (Back/Forward/
Up/Refresh + `ViewMode::toggled` / `SortMode::next`), so they cannot diverge
and the picker can drive the same toolbar. Accelerators: **`Alt+←/→`**
(Back/Forward), **`Alt+↑`** (Up), **`F5`** (Refresh). One `render::chrome_height`
(the toolbar strip) is the single header offset the item views, the
scrollbar gutter, and every hit-test share (§2.2). Host-tested in `lib/browse`
(`ViewMode::toggled`, the `SortMode::next` six-mode cycle, `ToolbarCommand::icon`
distinctness, `apply_command` navigation/view/sort + fail-closed refresh, and
`toolbar_command_at` enabled-resolution + disabled-fail-closed) and `lib/icon`
(the new glyphs draw + round-trip). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
`lib/browse`/`lib/icon` README + rustdoc.

The view-toggle and sort commands are toolbar (pointer) commands; they have no
conventional single-key accelerator, and a uniform keyboard path for every tool
awaits the later toolbar keyboard-focus pass (the `lib/controls::Toolbar`
`on_key` focus model), not invented chords now.

**The New Folder tool** (its `fs_mkdir` action already exists, §2.4),
and it exposed — and settled — a real design point: the drawn read-only
toolbar (`chrome::ToolbarCommand` / `apply_command` / `render`) is composed by
**both** the file manager *and* the trusted read-only picker, so a *write*
action cannot live on it without handing the picker write authority. New Folder
is therefore a separate **manager-only write-tool vocabulary**,
`chrome::ManagerTool` (with `MANAGER_TOOLS` + `ManagerTool::icon()`), that only
a write-capable consumer hands to `render` — the file manager passes
`MANAGER_TOOLS`, the picker passes `&[]`, so the picker cannot draw or resolve
a write tool (the separation is by type, not a runtime flag). `render` draws
the write tools in their own toolbar group after the read-only commands, and
`render::manager_tool_at` is the mirror hit-test (a read-only command's
position is unchanged whether or not tools follow, so `toolbar_command_at`
needs no `tools` argument). The `files.app` `Run` binary routes a toolbar click
(and the `Ctrl+Shift+N` keyboard equivalent) to `begin_new_entry`, which names
a non-clashing placeholder (`NewEntry::suggest_name`), creates it through
`Browser::create_entry` over the `fs_mkdir` seam under the user's own
identity (**no new capability**), and opens the inline rename on the new folder;
a refused create states its reason on `stderr` and leaves the listing put
(§2.24, §5.4). Host-tested in `lib/browse` (`manager_tool_at` resolves New
Folder and stays disjoint from the read-only commands, the empty-`tools` picker
never resolves a write tool, and `NewEntry::suggest_name` disambiguation) and
`lib/icon` (the `NewFolder` glyph). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
`lib/browse`/`lib/icon` README + rustdoc.

**The context menu is the desktop's** (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md`
M3.3). A secondary-button (right-click) press selects the item under the pointer
(or clears the selection on empty space, so only the directory-scoped Paste is
offered) and asks the one menu service to bring a chain up:
`chrome::context_menu` declares one row per `chrome::CONTEXT_COMMANDS` entry
(its `ContextCommand::label()` + `shortcut()` caption, *disabled with its
reason* — never hidden — when the model reports it inapplicable, so the menu's
shape does not move with the selection), and the `Run` binary sends it as an
`OpenMenu` anchored at the window-local press point. `ContextMenuModel::reason`
is the one rule and `is_enabled` derives from it, so a row cannot grey out with
nothing to say; the desktop shows that reason as the seat's tip on dwell and
never as a caption beside the label, which used to size the whole plate to
"only a file opens with an application" (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D33); removal
declares the destructive emphasis; a row's id is its command's position in
`CONTEXT_COMMANDS`, and `context_command_from_item` is that numbering's exact
inverse.

The answer is one `MenuClosed` matched against the open id the window minted, so
an answer to a settled gesture cannot run a stale command. The `Run` binary
routes the chosen command through `dispatch_context_command` to the *exact same*
app verbs the toolbar and keyboard already drive — Open (`activate`), Open and
Close (the same activation with the window closed behind the hand-off), Open
With… (FM6b), Rename (FM5), Cut/Copy/Paste (FM7), Properties (FM8), Delete
(FM9-c) — so the menu can never diverge from them (§2.2) and adds no authority
(every verb is the user's own §5.3-checked action). A refusal is stated on
`stderr` and the window carries on. The file manager draws no menu pixel and
holds no menu shell.

Host-tested in `lib/browse`: the row-id inverse over the whole command list, one
declared row per command carrying its own label and caption, every inapplicable
row disabled *with* the model's reason, the three distinct reasons Open With…
and Open and Close can state, that a decoded reason reaches the chain row's tip
and never its drawn form, the destructive emphasis on removal alone, and a
title the bounds refuse opening nothing. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
`docs/src/desktop/menus.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

`OpenWith` was **removed** from `ContextCommand`/`CONTEXT_COMMANDS` (and the now
unused `ContextMenuModel::selection_is_file` deleted with it, §2.14): the drawn
menu has no verb to invoke for it until the FM6b file→viewer hand-off lands, so
carrying a clickable-but-dead Open With… row would be speculative surface
(§2.4). It rejoins the command set in that stage, exactly as Delete and New
Folder join with the stages that first wire their behaviour. The drawn context
menu therefore has no `planned` remainder.

### FM5 — in-place rename

Done — the first write operation, and the model for the rest. The edit is
modelled in `lib/browse` (host-tested without a kernel); the `files.app` `Run`
binary supplies the inline text editor and the `fs_rename` seam.

- **Shared name rule**: the typed name is spelled through the new
  `lib/path::validate_file_name` — the *one* leaf-name rule (non-empty, not
  `.`/`..`, no `/`, no control/NUL, no `:`, within `FS_NAME_MAX`), also now
  the per-component check inside `lib/browse::vfs::absolute_path`, so the
  rename target and every path component obey one definition (§2.2). Two new
  `PathError` variants (`ReservedName`, `SeparatorInName`) name the leaf-only
  failures.
- **Engine** (`lib/browse::rename` + `Browser::prepare_rename` /
  `Browser::finish_rename`): `RenameError`
  (with a terse in-UI `message()`) and the pure `validate_new_name`
  (spelling + clash-with-a-different-sibling + no-op `Unchanged`).
  The rename is transactional and fail-closed — `prepare_rename` validates
  before any syscall and spells both paths, the app runs the `fs_rename` under
  the user's own identity (**no new capability**) on its reader thread rather
  than its event loop, and `finish_rename` re-lists and follows the selection
  to the new name; a VFS refusal leaves the listing untouched and is surfaced as
  `RenameError::Refused(errno)` (§2.24, §5.4). The read-only picker composes
  the same `Browser` and never calls the write path.
- **App** (`files.app`): `F2` opens the one shared `lib/controls::TextField`
  over the selected item's **name** (via `render::selection_name_rect`, which
  reads the drawn controls' own geometry — the list row's name-cell text span
  through `TableRow::cell_text_rect`, the grid tile's label band through
  `TileLayout::label_rect`), pre-filled and bounded by `FS_NAME_MAX`; keys route
  to the editor, edits live-validate (a clash/bad char shows in the field),
  `Enter` commits and `Escape` cancels. The window-channel wire key is mapped
  onto the `lib/input` vocabulary locally. The same rename is reachable without
  the in-place editor at all: the context menu's Rename row carries a
  quick-entry field as its child (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` M6), and a name
  committed there runs this very prepare-and-hand-on path.
- Host tests (`lib/browse`, `lib/path`): valid commit-then-refresh with the
  selection following, each invalid-name class refused before any syscall,
  clash, no-op unchanged, VFS refusal surfaced, empty-directory no-selection,
  `validate_new_name` purity, every `RenameError` message non-empty, and the
  field's rectangle lying on the name in both views rather than over the whole
  item. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse`/`lib/path`
  README + rustdoc.

### FM6a — the engine activation decision

The pure dispatch-by-kind decision behind a double-click / `Enter`, the
one primitive both the file manager and the trusted picker act on (§2.2). Added
to `lib/browse` as the `activate` module (`Activation`) + `Browser::activate_selected`
/ `activate_index`:

- **`Activation`** is exhaustive over the three entry kinds: `Descended` (the
  entry was a directory and the engine descended into it, transactionally, via
  its own fail-closed navigation — nothing to launch), `LaunchBundle { path }`
  (a `<Name>.app` bundle, named for the caller to launch through the signed
  load gate), and `OpenFile { path }` (a regular file, named for the caller to
  open in the associated viewer).
- **The engine holds no launch or open authority.** It decides *what* the
  target is and *what should happen*; the spawn and the `fs_open` stay in the
  app's own capability-checked tail under the user's identity, so the read-only
  picker composes the same `Browser` and simply never launches.
- **The target path is spelled through the one shared `vfs::absolute_path`**,
  so a launch/open can never name a different node than the browser shows; a
  name that cannot be spelled as a valid bounded absolute path fails closed as
  `BrowseError::Source` — the same outcome descending into it already produces.
- Host tests (`lib/browse`): directory→descend (listing changes), bundle→
  `LaunchBundle` without descending, file→`OpenFile` without descending, a
  nested target's path spelling, no-selection and out-of-range refusal, and a
  descent into an unreadable directory failing closed and staying put. Docs:
  `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

### FM6b — the app: launch `.app`, open a file, "Open With…"

Make items *do* something end-to-end — the defining first-class behaviour. The
`files.app` `Run` binary acts on the FM6a decision; this stage needs the spawn
and delegation wiring the pure engine model does not.

**The pure association model** (§2.19): the `lib/browse::open_with`
module lands the type→bundle "open with" model host-proven ahead of the app
wiring, exactly as FM6a landed the activation decision. `media_for_name`
derives a file's content type from its filename extension through the one
`lib/browse::media` registry the icon is drawn from (one table, one `extension`
split, §2.2), `BundleSource` is the injected installed-bundle
enumeration seam mirroring `DirectorySource`, and `applications_for(name,
bundles)` returns the `AppAssociation`s whose declared `AppInfo` MIME set
handles the file's type or any broader type it subclasses
(`MediaType::parent`, the shared-mime-info relation — an editor declaring
`text/plain` opens a `.rs` file), most specific claim first and source order
within a claim — no match being an honest empty
answer (§2.24), never a fabricated default. The type decision is a display
hint only; the load gate still verifies and capability-checks the picked
bundle, and the engine never spawns. Host-tested (the registry's type per
name, case-insensitivity, unknown/dotfile fail-closed, `handles`, match /
single / none / unrecognised, seam refusal, the subclass chain terminating for
every type, a generic `text/plain` application matching a refined extension,
and a specific declaration outranking a generic one). Docs:
`docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
`lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The app-side bundle launch.** The `files.app` `Run` binary now
dispatches a plain `Enter` on the selection through the shared
`Browser::activate_selected` (the one dispatch-by-kind decision the trusted
picker also acts on, §2.2): `Descended` reveals the selection and repaints (as
any navigation does), and `LaunchBundle { path }` launches the
`<Name>.app` bundle through the ordinary signed app-load gate — the manager's
own `Launcher` spawns the bundle's own `Run` (`<path>/Run`, never a private
path) via `tairix_rt::spawn`, under the launching user's identity, with the
`CAP_PROC_SPAWN` grant added to `AppInfo.toml` (and the kernel
`FILES_BROWSER_REQUEST` pin) in *this* stage (§2.4). The launch is **async and
non-blocking** (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`): `spawn` admits the child and returns
its PID before the image loads, so the event loop never freezes behind a load;
a synchronous refusal (a stripped capability, a malformed path) is stated
fail-loud on `stderr` at once, and a load refusal that only shows once the image
is read surfaces later as the child's reserved `LOAD_*` exit status, named by
the reap (the shared `tairix_abi::load_failure_reason` wording, §2.2, §2.24).
The manager **reaps** every launched child on a new any-child wait-set member
(`CHILD_TOKEN`), drained in the event source's park branch the instant it fires,
so a launched app is never left a zombie and the wake never degrades into a
busy-poll (§2.23). Only the write/spawn-capable file manager builds and drives
this; the read-only picker composes the same `Browser` and never launches.
The app wiring rides the FM9 autoload vertical; the freestanding `Run` builds
and clippy-clean cross-compiled, and the manifest grant is pinned by the kernel
`appinfo_sources_match_the_embedded_registry` host test.

**Opening a data file in its associated viewer (`OpenFile`) is now done** —
the defining "make items *do* something" behaviour. The inherited-document
hand-off is the TAIRiX spelling of `viewer < file`, race-free at spawn:

- **The launch convention** is `tairix_abi::DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` (a reserved
  launch-argument token, modelled on `SPAWN_SELF`) plus the `STDIN` stream: a
  launcher that opens a document for a viewer opens the file read-only in its
  **own** table, spawns the viewer with a `SpawnAttach` block wiring that
  descriptor onto the child's `STDIN` slot (`FdWire::Handle`), and passes the
  token as an argument. The kernel clones the read-only *open description* into
  the child owner-checked, so the viewer reads its document with **no
  filesystem capability of its own** (least privilege, §5.2) and there is no
  post-spawn channel, handle-forwarding, or ordering race. This **supersedes**
  the earlier fd_grant-to-attested-PID sketch (`fd_grant`/`fd_redeem` stay the
  picker's *post-hoc* delegation to an already-running window owner; §2.13).
- **The signed `AppInfo` now carries file-type associations.** The bundle
  composer parses an optional `associations` MIME array from `AppInfo.toml`
  and emits the signed MIME table the ABI already reserved (`mime_count` /
  `mime_type_at`); the whole body — capabilities then MIME table — is under the
  signature, so a tampered association breaks the bundle. `view.app` declares
  the picture types its decoder supports completely.
- **The running-system `BundleSource` is `files.app`'s `RtBundleSource`**: a
  bounded recursive walk of the system program stores then `/Apps`, reading each
  `<Name>.app/AppInfo` through the shared, host-tested
  `lib/browse::association_from_appinfo` decode (fail-closed — a corrupt
  manifest is skipped, never offered). `Activation::OpenFile { path }` resolves
  the associated bundle via `applications_for` (keyed off the file's leaf
  name — never a hard-coded viewer path), and `Launcher::open_file` /
  `launch_viewer` `fs_open`s the file read-only and `spawn_attached`es the
  bundle's `Run` with the `STDIN` wire + `DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` + the leaf-name
  title, closing its own descriptor and reaping the child on the same any-child
  member. A file no installed application claims is stated fail-loud on
  `stderr`, never a fabricated open (§2.24). Only the write/spawn-capable file
  manager does this; the read-only picker composes the same `Browser` and never
  launches. Host-tested (`association_from_appinfo` valid / empty / fail-closed);
  the app wiring rides the FM9 vertical and builds clippy-clean cross-compiled.
- **The viewer's inherited-document startup path**: `view.app`
  detects `DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` and reads its document from the inherited `STDIN`
  descriptor (titling its window from the leaf name), distinct from its
  interactive picker path (its standalone launch is unchanged). The wire now
  *confers* the manager's reach — a path-backed descriptor reaches the child as
  a delegation carrying the spawning parent's captured identity — which is what
  makes the hand-off reach an application holding no filesystem capability at
  all (D119, `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`).

**The explicit "Open With…" chooser is now done, and it is not a menu**
(`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §6, decision 2 — the candidate set grows with the
applications a user installs, so no menu plate can promise to hold it, and a
menu's rows must all exist before it opens, which would put a read of three
program stores on every right-click). `OpenWith` is a row of
`chrome::CONTEXT_COMMANDS`, enabled only for a regular file — a directory
descends and a bundle launches itself, so neither has an application to pick, and
each says so. Choosing it concludes the chain; the app then resolves the file's
absolute path (the shared `chosen_target_path`), enumerates the full
`applications_for` candidate list over `RtBundleSource`, and — when at least one
application claims the type — opens an `open_with::OpenWithChooser` in its own
popup window, opening with the identity band that names the file, then one
`ListRow` per candidate in ranked order, scrolled in pixels inside its own
shape by wheel (`render::open_with_scroll_wheel`), by the drawn bar's drag
(through the one `ScrollColumn` routing the listing's bar uses, §2.2), and by
Up/Down/Home/End with the selection revealed whole (`render::open_with_reveal`).
A press resolved through `render::open_with_row_at` (which mirrors the draw's
placement, so paint and click cannot disagree, §2.2) picks a candidate; a
double-click, `Enter`, or the Open button launches it through the **same**
`DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` + `STDIN` hand-off `open_file` already uses; `Escape` or
Cancel dismisses it and launches nothing. A file no
installed application claims is stated fail-loud on `stderr` and opens nothing
(§2.24). The default open still picks the first association; the chooser lets the
user pick any. Host-tested in `lib/browse` (the `OpenWith` enablement and reason
over file/directory/bundle/dangling-link/empty, the chooser refusing an empty
candidate list, its selection clamping at both ends, its wheel stepping and
clamping, its least-pixel reveal, the draw/hit-test agreeing on the same row
before and after a scroll, and the rows its edges cut drawn whole and pressed
where they show); the app wiring builds clippy-clean cross-compiled. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
`lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

Double-click activation was deferred from FM6b to its own pointer pass; it is
now landed as **FM12** below (the shared `click::DoubleClickTracker` over the
capability-free monotonic clock, driving the same `activate` dispatch `Enter`
does).

### FM7a — the selection + clipboard model

Done (§2.19 — the pure model host-proven ahead of the app verbs, exactly as
FM6a/FM6b's pure model landed). The two `lib/browse` modules the management
verbs are built on:

- **Multi-selection** (`select::Selection` + `Browser` methods): the
  per-listing set of marked entries plus the range anchor. `single` (plain
  click / unmodified keyboard move), `toggle` (`Ctrl`-click), `range_to`
  (`Shift`-click from the anchor), and `select_all`; `Browser::select`,
  `toggle_selection`, `extend_selection_to`, `select_all`, `clear_selection`
  bounds-check every index against the live listing (`NoSuchEntry` otherwise).
  Because members are indices, every listing change (navigate / refresh /
  re-sort) and every unmodified move collapses the selection to the single
  focused entry, so it never points at a stale row.
- **Cut/copy clipboard** (`clipboard` module + `Browser::clipboard`):
  `ClipboardOp` (`Copy`/`Cut`) and a `Clipboard` capturing the selected
  entries' absolute component paths (so it survives navigating to the paste
  target); `None` when nothing is selected. `plan_paste(clipboard, target)`
  resolves each source to a destination under the target and is fail closed
  (§5.4): a target inside one of the moved items is `PasteError::WouldRecurse`
  (an exact component-prefix test), and a paste back into an item's own
  directory is flagged (`PasteItem::overwrites_source`) for the app to confirm
  rather than silently clobber (§2.24). The `Empty` case is the *absence* of a
  clipboard (`Option::None`), not a paste error, so a constructed `Clipboard`
  is never empty and no dead variant lingers (§2.14). The model names *what*
  would move where; the app performs the move/copy under the user's own
  identity, so composing it grants nothing and the picker never builds one.
- Host-tested in `lib/browse/src/tests.rs` (each `Selection` gesture + anchor,
  the bounds refusals, the listing-change/keyboard collapse, the empty-directory
  empty selection, clipboard capture + `None`, `Clipboard::new` empty/root
  refusal, `plan_paste` mapping / self-overwrite flag / recurse-into-self +
  descendant + sibling-prefix, and the error message). Docs:
  `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

### FM7b — move, copy, paste, delete, new folder

The core management verbs on top of the FM7a model.

**The pure paste-execution model** (§2.19 — host-proven ahead of the
app verbs, exactly as FM6a/FM6b/FM7a's pure models landed): the
`lib/browse::execute` module. `paste_strategy(op, source, dest)` makes the
move-vs-copy decision from the clipboard op and the two items' `VolumeId`s (the
16-byte `fs_stat` volume identity) — `Copy` streams, a same-volume `Cut` is one
`Rename`, a cross-volume `Cut` is `CopyThenDelete` — the one `mv`/`st_dev`
definition (§2.2). `CopyCursor`/`CopyChunk` model the bounded, resumable,
interruptible streamed copy: a known-length source is walked in fixed
`COPY_CHUNK_LEN` steps, `advance`d by the bytes actually carried (so short reads
and cancellation between chunks both work), `resume`d from a persisted offset,
and fail closed — advancing/resuming past the source length is
`CopyError::Overrun`, never a silent wrap (§2.23, §5.4). The engine does no I/O
and the cross-volume source is deleted only after its copy fully succeeds, so
composing it grants nothing and the read-only picker never runs it. Host-tested
(strategy per op × volume, `VolumeId` round-trip, empty/small/large chunking to
completion, short-transfer advance, resume, resume/advance overrun, error
message). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The pure new-folder model** (§2.19 — host-proven ahead of the drawn
New Folder tool, exactly as the paste-execution model landed ahead of the app
verbs): the `lib/browse::create` module (`CreateError` + `validate_new_entry_name`)
plus `Browser::create_entry`. `validate_new_entry_name` spells the typed name
through the one shared `lib/path::validate_file_name` rule and refuses a name a
sibling already carries (`Clash`), both before any syscall. `create_entry`
spells the new folder's absolute path through the one shared
`Browser::spell_child` helper the launch/open targets also use (de-duplicated
from the two former private copies, §2.2), applies it through an injected
`fs_mkdir` seam under the user's own identity (**no new capability**), then
re-lists and follows the selection onto the new folder ready for the inline
rename — transactional and fail closed, a VFS refusal leaving the listing put
and surfacing as `CreateError::Refused` (§2.24, §5.4). The read-only picker
composes the same `Browser` and never calls it. Host-tested in `lib/browse`
(commit creates + selects the new folder, each invalid-name class refused
before any syscall, clash refused, VFS refusal surfaced leaving the listing
put, create in an empty directory needs no selection, failed post-create
re-list surfaced, `validate_new_entry_name` purity, every `CreateError` message
non-empty). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The pure delete model** (§2.19 — host-proven ahead of the app verb,
exactly as the paste-execution and new-folder models landed): the
`lib/browse::delete` module (`DeletePlan` + `DeleteTarget`) plus
`Browser::plan_delete`. `plan_delete` captures the current multi-selection into
a `DeletePlan` (`None` when nothing is selected), one `DeleteTarget` per marked
entry in listing order, each carrying the entry's absolute component path (the
one shared spelling, so a target names exactly the node the browser shows) and
whether it is directory-backed on disk — a directory *or* a sealed `<Name>.app`
bundle, via the new `EntryKind::is_directory_backed`, so either is removed with
`UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY` and recursed into while a regular file is a leaf.
`DeletePlan::new` is fail closed: an empty selection, or any target naming the
root (an empty component list), yields no plan rather than one that could
remove nothing or the root itself (§5.4). `len`/`has_directories` are the
honest figures a delete confirmation reports (§2.24). The model names *what*
would be removed; the app performs each `fs_unlink` under the user's own
identity (**no new capability**), so composing it grants nothing and the
read-only picker never builds one. Host-tested in `lib/browse` (capture +
per-target path/kind, none-on-empty-selection, a bundle marked
directory-backed, a files-only plan reporting no directories, and the
fail-closed `DeletePlan::new` empty/root refusals). Docs:
`docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The pure recursive-delete *execution* model** (§2.19 — host-proven
ahead of the app verb, the delete-side analogue of the paste-side
`execute::CopyCursor`): the `lib/browse::delete::DeleteWalk` driven cursor.
`DeleteWalk::from_plan` begins a removal of a `DeletePlan`; `next_action` yields
the next `DeleteAction` — `List(path)` (the app reads that directory and reports
its children with `expand`, so contents are removed before their container) or
`Remove { path, is_directory }` (the app `fs_unlink`s the leaf or now-empty
directory and reports it with `complete_removal`), depth-first. It does no I/O,
keeps its own explicit stack (so a deep tree cannot overflow the call stack),
is bounded by `MAX_DELETE_DEPTH` (a fail-closed defence — a deeper tree is
`DeleteError::TooDeep`, never descended without limit, §26.6/§24.4), and holds
its exact position between steps so the app can cancel or be preempted without
losing or repeating work (§2.23 — no unbounded buffer, no spin); driving it
against the wrong step is `DeleteError::OutOfStep`, leaving the walk unchanged.
`removed` is the honest rising count a progress indicator shows (the total is
unknown until the reads reveal it, so no fabricated percentage, §2.24). It is
the browser engine's own component-path traversal, deliberately distinct from
`rm`'s coreutils removal engine — two consumers with two data models, not one
algorithm copied twice (§2.2). Host-tested in `lib/browse` (single file, empty
directory listed-then-removed, contents-before-container depth-first order,
multiple targets in listing order, the `TooDeep` bound, out-of-step fail-closed
refusals leaving the walk put, and the interruption/resume holding its exact
position). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The app-side Delete verb.** The `files.app` `Run` binary binds the
`Delete` key to a modal confirmation before any removal. `begin_delete` captures
the selection with `Browser::plan_delete` (a no-op when nothing is selected —
the plan is `None`, fail closed) and opens a `lib/controls::Dialog` built by the
shared `render::build_delete_dialog`: the title names a single target or reports
the honest count, the message warns when folders (and their contents) are among
the removals, and the honest Action Warmth sits on the safe recommended
**Cancel**, never the destructive **Delete** (§2.24). While the dialog is up it
owns the window (`apply_modal_event` handles it first): `Escape`/Cancel dismiss,
`Enter`/Delete confirm; a primary press routes through the mirror
`render::delete_dialog_action_at` (over the dialog's own `Dialog::action_rects`),
fail closed off a button. On confirm the app drives a `DeleteWalk` to completion
— reading each directory with the same capability-checked listing call and
shared decode the browser navigates with (`tairix_browse::vfs`), and
`fs_unlink`ing each node depth-first (with `UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY` for a
directory-backed target) under the user's own identity, **no new capability** —
then re-lists so a partial removal is shown honestly. It is bounded and fail
closed: the first refused read or unlink stops the removal, states the reason on
`stderr` (fail loud, §2.24), and leaves what was already removed removed rather
than a fabricated success (§5.4). Only the write-capable file manager builds and
drives this; the read-only picker never deletes. Host-tested in `lib/browse`
(the confirm dialog's honest title/count + folder warning, the destructive/
recommended action roles, `delete_dialog_rect` centering/clamp,
`draw_delete_dialog` paint/degenerate-no-panic, and the `delete_dialog_action_at`
full-window mirror + fail-closed) and `lib/controls` (`Dialog::action_rects`
matching `on_pointer`'s geometry). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
`lib/browse`/`lib/controls` README + rustdoc.

**The pure recursive-copy *walk* model** (§2.19 — host-proven ahead of
the app move/copy verbs, the copy-side analogue of the delete-side
`delete::DeleteWalk`): the `lib/browse::execute::CopyWalk` driven cursor. Where
`execute::CopyCursor` streams a single *file*, `CopyWalk` copies a whole *tree*:
`from_items` begins a copy of resolved `(source, dest, is_directory)` items (the
app supplies each item's kind, which the path-only `Clipboard` does not carry)
and is fail closed — an empty set, or a source/dest naming the root, yields no
walk (§5.4). `next_action` yields the next `CopyAction` — `MakeDir { dest }` (the
app `fs_mkdir`s the destination *before* its contents, so a child always has a
parent, reported with `created`), `List { source }` (the app reads it and
reports children with `expand`), or `CopyFile { source, dest }` (the app streams
the bytes with a `CopyCursor`, reported with `copied_file`), depth-first. It
does no I/O, keeps its own explicit stack (so a deep tree cannot overflow the
call stack), is bounded by `MAX_COPY_DEPTH` — the one shared `MAX_WALK_DEPTH`
recursion bound `DeleteWalk` also obeys, hoisted so the two walks cannot drift
(§2.2, §26.6) — and holds its exact position between steps so the app can cancel
or be preempted without losing or repeating work (§2.23); a deeper tree is
`CopyWalkError::TooDeep` and driving it against the wrong step is
`CopyWalkError::OutOfStep`, both leaving the walk unchanged. `copied` is the
honest rising count a progress indicator shows (§2.24). The model holds no
authority, so the read-only picker never runs one. Host-tested in `lib/browse`
(single file, container-before-contents depth-first order, multiple items in
order, empty-directory create-then-empty-list, the `TooDeep` bound, the
out-of-step fail-closed refusals leaving the walk put, the interruption/resume
holding its exact position, `from_items` empty/root fail-closed, and the error
messages). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

**The app-side move/copy verbs are done.** The `files.app` `Run` binary holds
one `Clipboard` in its overlay state, captured by `Ctrl+X` (a move clipboard)
or `Ctrl+C` (a copy clipboard) from the current selection
(`Browser::clipboard(op)`; nothing selected is a fail-closed no-op), and pasted
into the current directory by `Ctrl+V`. Paste validates the plan with
`plan_paste` (a paste of a folder into itself is refused outright, nothing
touched), stats the destination directory for its `VolumeId`, and carries out
each item under the user's own identity — **no new capability**:
`execute::paste_strategy` picks `fs_rename` for a same-volume move,
copy-then-delete for a cross-volume move (the source removed through the shared
delete path only after its copy fully succeeds), and a stream for a copy — a
file through an `execute::CopyCursor` and a directory (or sealed `.app` bundle)
through an `execute::CopyWalk`, over `fs_read`/`fs_write`/`fs_mkdir`/`fs_readdir`
with one reused, fixed-size (`FS_IO_MAX`) buffer, so a copy of any size holds no
unbounded buffer and never spins (§2.23, §26.6). It is bounded and fail closed:
the first refused operation stops the paste, states the reason on `stderr`
naming the item (fail loud, §2.24), and leaves what already landed in place
(§5.4); the view is re-listed so a partial paste is shown honestly. A completed
`Cut` clears the clipboard; a `Copy` keeps it. A destination is created
*exclusively*, so a pre-existing name is refused rather than clobbered, and a
`Copy` back into an item's own directory is refused rather than duplicated onto
itself — overwrite/merge confirmation is a deliberate v1 scope boundary, not a
silent overwrite. Only the write-capable file manager builds and drives this;
the read-only picker never pastes. The engine models are host-tested in
`lib/browse` (FM7a + the `execute` model above); the app wiring rides the FM9
autoload vertical. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `files.app` README +
`run.rs` rustdoc.

**Progress + cancel covers both the Delete verb and copy/paste.** Neither
interactive verb drives its walk to completion in one blocking pass: the
confirmed work is handed to an interleaved **operation** the event loop advances
a bounded slice at a time (`advance_operation`, up to `OPERATION_STEP_BUDGET`
units of work per turn — one directory read, one unlink, one `fs_mkdir`, one
copy chunk, or one rename), repainting a modal progress panel and polling the
event mailbox *non-blocking* for a mid-run cancel or a close between slices, so
even a large recursive delete or a multi-gigabyte copy never freezes the window
and never busy-spins — the walk is genuine pending work, so continuously
stepping it is not a spin (§2.23). One `Operation` carries either a `Job::Delete`
(a `DeleteWalk`) or a `Job::Paste` (the app-side `Paste` state machine), so both
drive through the one interleaving path (§2.2). The drawn surface is the shared
`lib/browse::progress` model (`ProgressModel` — op kind, the honest rising count
from the walk's own figure, and a *latched* cancel) painted by
`render::draw_progress_dialog` as a `lib/controls` `Panel` + an indeterminate
`Progress` trace (a "working" bar, no fabricated percentage since the total is
unknown until the reads reveal it, §2.24) + a Cancel `Button`;
`render::progress_cancel_at` is the mirror hit-test resolving a click to the
drawn button (fail closed off it, §2.2/§5.4). A latched cancel stops the walk at
the next unit boundary (never mid-node, and never mid-chunk), and a completed or
cancelled/refused run alike re-lists so a partial result is shown honestly
(§2.24). The blocking and the non-blocking event paths share one `accept_frame`
sender-attestation (§2.2).

The **copy/paste** slice is app-side interleaving only, over the *existing*
engine models and drawn surface (§2.19): `Ctrl+V` no longer drives the copy
synchronously. `run_paste` validates the plan, stats the destination volume, and
hands a `Paste` to the `Job::Paste` operation; the event loop then advances it
through `advance_paste`. The `Paste` machine holds its exact position between
slices in a `PasteStage` (`Idle` → begin the next item; `Copying` — a per-item
`CopyWalk` with an in-flight leaf-file `Transfer` streamed one bounded chunk at a
time so a single huge file cannot block the loop; `Deleting` — a cross-volume
move's source removal over the *same* shared `DeleteWalk`, so a move's cleanup
and an interactive delete can never diverge, §2.2), decides each item's mechanism
with `paste_strategy` as it runs, and reuses one fixed-size `FS_IO_MAX` buffer
(§2.23, §26.6). It is fail closed: the first refusal stops the paste, states the
reason on `stderr` naming the item (fail loud, §2.24), and leaves what already
landed in place (§5.4). Initiating a `Cut` paste clears the clipboard (its
sources are being moved); a `Copy` keeps it. The now-dead synchronous
`run_paste_item`/`copy_tree`/`copy_file`/`copy_dir`/`delete_source` helpers are
deleted (§2.14).

The engine models are host-tested in `lib/browse` (FM7a + the `execute` model
above: strategy per op × volume, chunked-copy completion/short-transfer/resume/
overrun, the `CopyWalk`/`DeleteWalk` order + `TooDeep` + out-of-step, and the
`ProgressModel` count/verb/no-percentage + latched cancel + `progress_cancel_at`
mirror); the app-side drive interleaving (`advance_operation`/`advance_paste`)
rides the FM9 autoload vertical. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse`
README + rustdoc, `files.app` `run.rs` rustdoc.

(**New Folder** — its drawn manager-only tool + `Ctrl+Shift+N` +
create-then-inline-rename wiring landed with FM4b's chrome; see that stage.)

### FM8a — the properties view model

Done (§2.19 — the pure model host-proven ahead of the drawn panel, exactly as
FM6a/FM6b/FM7a/FM7b's pure models landed): the `lib/browse::properties` module.
`Properties::from_stat(name, kind, stat)` turns an entry's name, its browser
`EntryKind`, and the node's `fs_stat` `FileStat` into the display-ready fields
the panel renders — a human kind label (`Folder`/`File`/`Application`, so a
sealed `<Name>.app` bundle reads distinctly from an ordinary directory), the
apparent `size` and on-disk `allocated` bytes (both via the shared
`format_size`, never one derived from the other), the raw mode + its
four-digit octal spelling, the ten-character permission string, the owning
uid/gid, and the four `Time64` stamps rendered as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` by the
new `format::format_datetime`. Every field is straight from `fs_stat` (§21,
64-bit-native), no fabricated field: a stamp the backing does not keep is the
epoch and renders blank, never a made-up `1970-01-01` wall time.

- **The permission spelling is one shared definition (§2.2).** The
  `drwxr-xr-x` mapping is the new `tairix_abi::fs::mode_string` — an alloc-free
  `[u8; 10]` producer in the ABI crate that owns the mode bits — so the
  properties view and `ls -l` can never disagree on what a mode means. The
  private duplicate that lived in the `ls` app is deleted and `ls` now
  delegates to it (§2.14). The permission string's leading type indicator
  reads from the structural `FileStat::kind`, so a bundle is *labelled*
  "Application" yet honestly shows a directory's `d`.
- **The model holds no authority.** The app performs the one
  capability-checked `fs_stat` under the user's own identity and hands the
  result here; the model reads nothing, so composing it grants nothing and the
  read-only picker builds the same view (§4, §5.4).
- Host-tested: `lib/browse` (regular-file / directory / bundle summaries,
  timestamp render + epoch-blank, octal masking) and `lib/browse::format`
  (`format_datetime` date+time, epoch-blank, sub-second, pre-1970/post-2038),
  and `lib/abi` (`mode_string` kind indicator + triads + empty/full/private +
  higher-bit masking). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse`
  README + rustdoc, `tairix_abi::fs::mode_string` rustdoc.

### FM8b — the drawn Properties window + permission/ownership editing

The permission (mode) control, the ownership-change model with its
privileged kernel primitive, the ownership control, and the extended-attribute
list all landed. The trusted picker shows no Properties: choosing a file needs
none, and a metadata read there would be a second privileged path.

**The General section's facts.** The closed `render::Field` vocabulary is the
one host-tested definition of which facts the General section states and how
each reads — kind, a link's stored target, size + on-disk `allocated`, and the
four `Time64` stamps, all straight from `fs_stat` (§21, 64-bit-native
throughout), no fabricated fields — so the display order, each label, each
value, and which facts a given node shows cannot drift apart. The alias row
appears only for a node that stores a target. The mode's symbolic and octal
spelling is the Permissions section's reading, and the owning ids its editable
values.

**The file manager's Properties is a window of its own**
(`render::draw_properties_window`, opened at
`render::properties_window_extent`, resizable thereafter). Several are open at
once, each pinned to its node by *path* — so the listing behind them may be
reloaded or navigated away from without any of them describing or writing to
something else — and the listing stays usable while they are open, which an
in-window modal could not offer. Its client is the fields, the permission and
ownership controls, and the extended-attribute list; no second panel header
inside a window that already has a title bar. A section taller than the body
— the window may be dragged down to the floor `properties_sizing` declares — is laid
out at its natural height and scrolled in pixels through the body, a bar beside
it: the wheel (`render::properties_scroll_wheel`), the bar
(`render::properties_scroll_pointer`), and the keyboard's reveal of the row a
cursor lands on (`render::properties_reveal`) move the window's one
`ScrollColumn`, a section switch starts the new section at its top, and a press
lands only on what the scroll shows. The attribute rows scroll in the band
above the `key = value` editor, which stays put. `files.app` opens one with
`Alt+Enter` or the context menu's *Properties* row: the node is resolved from
the listing that named it (`Browser::chosen_target_path`), the window is
appended once the round's borrow of its own window has ended, and the **read
leaves the loop** — one `fs_stat` plus one `fs_attr_get` per attribute key is a
stall, not a frame (§28.1). `render::PropertiesFrame` is what the window draws:
`Reading` until the answer lands, `Refused` with the reason, or `Ready`.
`render::properties_hit` is the one hit-test over the whole client, stating the
precedence once — the capability-free permission toggles resolve before the
privileged ownership control, and a press on nothing resolves to nothing.

**Permissions.** `lib/browse::mode_edit::set_mode` is the pure, path-targeted
model: `validate_mode` fails closed on any bit above `FS_MODE_MASK` (refused,
never masked into a different mode), the validation runs *before* any syscall,
and the change goes through an injected `fs_set_mode` seam under the user's own
identity (**no new capability**); a refusal surfaces as `ModeError::Refused`
leaving the mode untouched (§2.24, §5.4). The section is two groups of the
shared form family (`FieldGroup`/`FieldRow`, `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`
§11.41) stacked by the shared plate column (`tairix_controls::stack`), with no
layout arithmetic of its own (`render::PermsSection`): **ACCESS** — the
symbolic + octal mode as a `Reading` row, then one `Owner`/`Group`/`Other` row
per class whose slot is a `FlagSet` of three labelled `Checkbox`es
(`Read`/`Write`/`Execute`) — over **OWNERSHIP**, the owning user and group.
Every control lines up in one column, the width a class's flags need, so
neither a node's reading nor an open id editor can move one. The window's
opening width is derived from the access group's natural width, so every flag
opens seated whole under any type ladder; a narrower window elides the labels
and keeps every box. `render::PERMISSION_BITS`/`permission_cells` are the one
definition of which bit each flag carries. A press flips that `rwx` bit alone,
preserving the setuid/setgid/sticky bits, and re-reads the node on success so
the window shows what the kernel applied. Those higher bits stay visible in the
octal/symbolic spelling and are edited via `chmod` — a deliberate scope
boundary.

The keyboard reaches every control the pointer does. From the strip, `Down` or
`Tab` takes it into the section (`render::PermsCursor`, carried in
`PropertiesView`); there `Up`/`Down` walk the rows and carry between the two
groups, `Left`/`Right` walk an access row's flags (keeping the column as the
cursor moves between classes), and `Space`/`Enter` toggle the flag or open the
ownership cell — resolved by `render::properties_permissions_key` to the same
`PropertiesTarget` a press is, so both reach one act — while `Tab` or `Escape`
hands the keyboard back to the strip. `route::properties_key` gives the section
the arrows and `Escape` only while it holds the keyboard.

**Ownership.** Reassigning a file's *owner* is genuinely unlike the other write
verbs, so it is gated by the dedicated `CAP_FS_CHOWN` (id 39, the Unix
`CAP_CHOWN` analogue), carried by the `ADMINISTRATIVE_SET` ceiling and by
nothing an ordinary session holds (§5.2 — a capability guarding a real class of
authority, added with its live holder and enforcement point). The kernel
primitive is `fs_set_owner` (no. 96): the whole authority rule lives in the
secured VFS (`DelegatedFs::set_owner` over the frozen driver `set_security`, so
no driver-trait change) — reassigning the uid, or setting a gid the caller is
not a member of, requires `CAP_FS_CHOWN`; otherwise only the node's owner may
change the group, and only to a group they belong to (the unprivileged
`chgrp`); any change strips the set-*id* bits (the `chown(2)` safety
behaviour). Dispatch keeps the coarse `CAP_FS_ACCESS` gate; the privileged
check is per-inode, in the VFS, under the caller's kernel-attested credential,
audited, fail closed (§5.4). Wired end to end: `lib/rt::fs_set_owner`, the C
stub `tairix_sys_fs_set_owner`, and the generated `include/` header. The engine
model is `lib/browse::owner_edit::set_owner` (`OwnerChange`/`OwnerError`/
`validate_owner`): it names *what* to change, refuses the reserved
`FS_OWNER_UNCHANGED` sentinel as an explicit target before any syscall, and
surfaces a refusal as `OwnerError::Refused` leaving the ownership untouched.
The cells are editable only where the launching user holds `CAP_FS_CHOWN`
(read once from the kernel-attested `self_origin`): each is a pressable plate
the `Owner` arm of `properties_hit` resolves to exactly the uid or gid it edits,
and the active `TextField` takes that row's slot, published as
`properties_owner_editor_rect`; a press on the open editor keeps the typing. A
session without the capability is shown the same cells refused — the rows'
`NeedsCapability` state wears the Authority Mark and the group's footnote says
why — and a press or a key on them resolves to nothing (§2.24). A non-numeric
or out-of-range id, or a VFS refusal, states its reason in the field and keeps
the editor open.

**Extended attributes** (the ARXFS `namespace.name` store,
`plans/ARXFS-METADATA.md`). The window lists the node's *visible* attributes
and can set and remove them. The kernel omits keys whose namespace the caller
may not read, so there is no privileged-namespace surface to build and
`system.*`/`trusted.*` are invisible rather than refused. Four states are
distinguished rather than shown as one empty list (`properties::Attributes`):
`Unread` (the picker never asks), `Unsupported` (the volume stores none),
`Refused` (with the reason), and the `Visible` set — drawn as selectable rows
scrolling in pixels in the band above the `key = value` editor, which stays put;
the cursor over them is the shared `RowList`. Values are opaque bytes, escaped
through `tairix_fsmeta::attr::display_value`, so nothing a volume stored
reaches a surface raw; a value whose bytes a typed line could not reproduce is
offered back by key alone with the reason stated, never lossily rewritten.
*Set* applies the `key = value` line and *Remove* deletes the cursor row's
attribute, through `fs_attr_set`/`fs_attr_remove` — needing only the
`CAP_FS_ACCESS` the app holds, with the node's own write permission the real
gate. The key is validated through the shared
`tairix_fsmeta::attr::parse_assignment` grammar *before* the call, so a
malformed key is refused in the app rather than by the kernel. Every applied
change re-reads the node (§28.4). The on-disk `AttrFlags` (`SYSTEM`,
`NO_BACKUP`) are a stated omission: no syscall surfaces them, so the window
does not invent them; named streams are staged future work.

**The deferred reads.** `PropertyReads` (`userland/apps/files/src/deferred.rs`)
is keyed by *window*, because several are open at once and one window's read
must not displace another's; a re-read of the same window supersedes its own
outstanding one, since only the latest answer describes the node now. A closed
window's read is forgotten and an answer for it dropped on delivery — a window
id could be reused, and an answer for a window that has gone belongs to nobody.

**Not yet off the loop:** the mode, owner and attribute *writes* are one
syscall each on a discrete press, like every other write gesture in this app
(rename, mkdir, delete, paste). Moving the app's write gestures to the worker
is `plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`'s staged work, not this increment's.

**FM8c — keyboard reach in the attributes section.** Its *Remove* action
has no key, and `Left`/`Right` walk the strip there rather than the attribute
editor's caret. Which key removes a row, and whether the section takes the
keyboard from the strip as the Permissions section does, is undecided.

**FM8d — a QEMU vertical for the window and the cue.** Two loop-level
behaviours the host tests structurally cannot reach are covered only by the
desk-level seam today — that a Properties window opens on the session and
adopts its deferred answer, and that a delivered folder-cue batch reaches the
screen with no input at all. Both want one vertical that opens a manager
window on a folder holding a non-empty subfolder, gates on `WINDOW_SHOWN` as
`filepick`/`handover` do, asserts the filled-folder cue appears unprompted,
then opens a Properties window on a node with an attribute and photographs it.
The existing `filepick`/`handover` verticals cover the `OpenWindow`/
`WindowKind` split against regression in the meantime.

Host-tested in `lib/browse` (the fact set/order, the alias row and its
absence, the mode reading, one whole-client scan proving
every permission toggle, both owning ids, each attribute row, the editor and
both actions are reachable and pairwise apart, every flag seated whole at the
opening size under the shipped themes, double density and a wider type ladder,
every toggle still apart at the narrowest window, the keyboard reaching every
toggle and both owning ids as the targets a press resolves, its cursor walking,
carrying and stepping back out, the open editor drawn inside its published
rectangle and kept on a press, the row→attribute mapping under a pixel scroll,
the bands moving exactly one row when an alias adds one, each drawn state
differing, a press on the gutter scrolling the list and repainting the rows it
slid, each section scrolling in the shortest window the manager declares — the
General facts under the wheel, the Permissions cursor revealing the row it
walks onto, the attribute cursor revealed — and the extent scaling with
density), in `userland/apps/files`
(the property desk answering two windows independently, a re-read superseding
its own answer, a refusal delivered as its reason, a closed window's answer
dropped, and which part of the window each key reaches), in `lib/fsmeta` (the
value display and the
assignment grammar), and in `kernel/core`/`kernel/syscall`/`lib/rt` for the
`fs_set_owner` primitive. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,

### FM9 — the autoload QEMU vertical + docs

FM9 is split (§2.19) so the vertical's robust, non-fragile gates exist before
the click-through that keys on them is written.

- **FM9-pre — filesystem-mutation audit gates.** The write
  syscalls the vertical must observe (`fs_mkdir`, `fs_unlink`, `fs_rename`,
  `fs_set_mode`, `fs_set_owner`) emitted **no** audit record, so there was no
  kernel-attested serial witness for a New-Folder / rename / delete step to
  gate on — and, independently, mutating on-disk state is a security-relevant
  decision the charter (§5.4(4)/§19.4) requires be logged. Landed: two stable
  events in `kernel/core` — `FsNodeMutated` (id 4100, `Info`) on a successful
  mutation and `FsMutationDenied` (id 4101, `Warn`, carrying the refusal's
  `errno`) — emitted by every write handler after the secured VFS decides,
  under the caller's kernel-attested uid, via the free `emit_fs_mutation`
  (with `audit_path_field` bounding the path on a char boundary so an
  over-long path can never drop the record, and `format_mode_octal` for the
  chmod field). Fields: `op` (`mkdir`/`rmdir`/`unlink`/`rename`/`chmod`/
  `chown`), `uid`, `path`, plus `to` (rename dest), `mode` (chmod), and
  `owner`/`group` (chown); read-only ops are not audited; no token/secret is
  logged. Host-tested in `kernel/core` (`fs_audit_tests`: allow+deny id/level/
  fields per op, path-bounding incl. multibyte boundary + always-emitted, octal
  mode). Docs: `docs/src/architecture/kernel.md` audit catalogue.
- **The manager already has a writable place to act — no extra fixture
  volume is needed (corrected §2.3).** An earlier draft of FM9 said the
  autoload fixture "must first give the fixture a **writable** volume
  because `/System` is read-only". That prerequisite is redundant and was
  dropped: the autoload vertical boots the production path, which on a
  successful unlock publishes the encrypted `ARXFSRoot` partition
  **read-write** as `/` and its writable sub-mounts (`/Users`, `/Storage`,
  `/System/Logs`, `/System/Settings`) — see
  `tairix_kernel::unlock_orchestrate::WritableStateSink` /
  `system_mount::register_writable_state`. The shared users-root fixture
  already carries `/Users/root/`, owned by the logged-in account
  (`tairix_users::FIRST_USER_UID`/`FIRST_USER_GID`, mode `0700`;
  `tairix_test_arxfs_image::build_users_root_image_with_key`), and the
  desktop session (and the files bundle it spawns) run as that account.
  So the manager can create/rename/delete under `/Users/root` with the
  authority it already holds. Adding a fourth writable partition would
  duplicate an already-writable tree (§2.3) and is forbidden; FM9 acts on
  `/Users/root`.

- **FM9 is split (§2.19) into three mutation increments**, each a complete,
  fully-gated landing appended **after** the AW4 terminal round trip (so the
  existing delivery counts 2/4/7/16 do not shift; each new stage adds its own
  kernel-attested PASS witness rather than re-deriving the terminal gates):
  - **FM9-a — New Folder + inline-rename.** The product half is
    `render::selection_name_rect` for rows, the forward
    `render::manager_tool_rect` over `Toolbar::tool_rect` for the New Folder
    tool, and the inline-rename commit, all host-tested.
    The create's guest coverage is
    `tests/integration/fsmutate_qemu_aarch64`, which reaches it by pointer
    alone: it right-clicks bare wallpaper, so
    the session opens the *backdrop's* own menu, and clicks its New Folder row
    (`PinboardCommand::NewFolder`), whose handler runs `fs_mkdir` in the
    account's desktop folder. The guest PASS is one `FsNodeMutated` record with
    `op=mkdir` whose `path` ends in the creator's own `NEW_FOLDER_BASE`,
    attributed by path rather than by a count because the file manager
    legitimately creates its Trash directory when a window opens. It is the
    first mutation record any guest run in this tree has produced; the whole
    gesture→syscall→audit-trail path was previously unexercised on a running
    kernel. Falsified by dropping the row click: the menu still opens and no
    mutation is recorded, so the run fails.
    The **rename** commit and the **toolbar** gesture stay blocked on
    `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D98: the rename needs typing sequenced after the
    click that opens the editor, which the harness's independent typed-key
    cursor cannot express, and the toolbar tool is not even drawn until
    `Ctrl+F9` reveals the band (`Chrome::HIDDEN` is what a window opens with) —
    a key the character-based injection has no spelling for.
  - **FM9-b — open a file into the viewer via CU6 delegation.**
    The trusted picker now opens at the user's home (`Browser::open_at` over
    the session's `HOME`, parsed with the shared
    `vfs::components_from_absolute_path`, falling back to `/`), and the shared
    users-root fixture plants a readable document (`HOME_DOC_NAME`) in
    `/Users/root`. The guest half is
    `tests/integration/filepick_qemu_aarch64` — its own vertical, not a stage
    on `autoload_input`, which is the D15 freeze case. It clicks the
    program-library button and `view`'s row; `view`, handed no document, asks
    the picker, which opens the home. A single pointer click on the document
    row (reconstructed through the production `Browser` and
    `render::entry_rect`, at `PICKER_ORIGIN` with **no** frame inset — the
    picker is undecorated session chrome) concludes the pick, so the session
    `fd_grant`s the chosen file to `view` and `view` `fd_redeem`s it.
    The guest PASS is `sc=fd_grant` from `comm=desktop` then `sc=fd_redeem`
    from `comm=view`, in that order: attributing each half to the principal
    the kernel says made the call is what makes the run a claim about a
    hand-off *between* processes, and the order rules out a redemption that
    could not have come from this pick.
    **Sequencing the pick is the hard part, and the gate must be the session's
    own announcement.** `PICKER_SHOWN` fires one-shot per pick and only once
    `Browser::is_listing()` is false — the sibling of `MENU_SHOWN` for the
    other surface no channel reports. Nothing derived from the session's
    `fs_open` records can stand in: it emits 43 of them per run, 10 after a
    library launch, and the listing is read on a worker, so no single read
    means "there is a row to click".
  - **FM9-c — delete with confirm.** A
    clickable **Delete** joins the context menu (`ContextCommand::Delete`,
    enabled on any selection), routed through the app's
    `dispatch_context_command` to the *same* `begin_delete` the `Delete` key
    opens — the action already existed, so this is not speculative surface
    (§2.4). Delivering the right-click needed a real compositor fix that also
    makes the *whole* context menu (Open/Rename/Cut/Copy/Paste/Properties/
    Delete) usable in the desktop: the secondary (right) button was being
    **dropped** — `tairix_wm`'s input router ignored it and the desktop
    session's router had a catch-all that swallowed it. Now the WM router
    raises+focuses and returns `InputResponse::SecondaryActivated` for a
    client-area right-press, the session router forwards `PointerPressed`
    `{Secondary}` to the WM, and the session delivers `WindowEvent::Pointer`
    `Pressed(Secondary)` to the app so it opens its menu — host-tested in
    `tairix-wm` (`secondary_press_activates_and_delivers_to_the_client`) and
    `tairix-desktop-session` (`secondary_press_over_a_window_routes_to_the_window_manager`).
    The shared `Menu::row_rect` gave a
    caller the drawn Delete row's rect (§2.2).
    - **The earlier "emulation gap" was a harness bug, now fixed and proven.**
      A prior draft recorded that a scripted right-click "never arrives in the
      guest" and blamed the emulator. The real cause was in the QEMU test
      harness (`tools/qemu`): QEMU's HMP `mouse_button` help string
      ("1=L, 2=M, 4=R") is **wrong**. `hmp_mouse_button` feeds the state mask
      to `qemu_input_update_buttons` through a `bmap` of the legacy
      `MOUSE_EVENT_*` bits (`MOUSE_EVENT_RBUTTON = 0x2`,
      `MOUSE_EVENT_MBUTTON = 0x4`), so state bit `0x2` is the **right** button
      and `0x4` the **middle**. The harness trusted the help string and sent a
      secondary press as bit `0x4`, which QEMU delivered to the guest as a
      *middle*-button event — so every OS layer decoded a correct (but wrong)
      button and the right-click context menu was unreachable in QEMU.
      `MouseButton::mask_bit` now sends the bit QEMU actually decodes as the
      right button (`0x2`). A dedicated aarch64 vertical,
      `tairix-test-pointer-button-virtio-mmio-qemu-aarch64`, proves it: it
      attaches a `virtio-mouse-device`, injects a secondary press+release, and
      the shared `virtio_input_button` tail asserts the driver decodes
      `BTN_RIGHT` (`0x111`), never the middle button (`0x112`). It **fails
      (times out) with the old mask and passes with the fix** — the
      fails-before/passes-after regression guard (§2.18).
    - **One vertical clicks this app's context menu; the rest of its verbs
      wait on D98.** Its plates are the desktop's own surfaces
      (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` M3.3), so a script aiming at one reconstructs the
      *session's* chain — which is tractable, and is what the hand-over
      vertical does (`reconstruct_manager_item_menu`): the chain is composed
      from the rows this app declares, so nothing restates a row by position,
      and the click is gated on the `MENU_SHOWN` record that says a plate
      reached the display. That covers the glue a host test cannot reach —
      sending the open and matching the answer's id — for the *Open* row. The
      remaining verbs (Rename/Cut/Copy/Paste/Properties/Delete) need the
      ordered typed-key script D98 blocks.
- **Docs** kept current in the same changes (§2.8, §13):
  `docs/src/desktop/apps.md` (the manager's design as each stage lands),
  the `lib/browse`/`lib/icon`/`lib/controls` rustdoc + `README.md`
  stability tiers (§6), and the app's 13-locale `Help/` tree (§16.5 —
  authored in the bundle, discovered by `tools/syshelp`, never hardcoded).

### FM10 — recoverable delete: move to Trash

The §0 scope promises a delete that "prefers a recoverable move to a per-user
trash location over an irreversible unlink … where the backing supports it
cheaply" (§2.24). FM9 shipped delete as an irreversible recursive `fs_unlink`;
FM10 makes it recoverable in the cheap case. Split (§2.19) into the pure engine
model and the app wiring, exactly as FM6/FM7/FM8 were.

- **FM10a — the pure move-to-Trash model.** `lib/browse::trash`,
  host-proven ahead of the app verb exactly as the pure delete/paste-execution
  models landed. `trash_strategy(item, trash)` makes the one recoverable-vs-
  irreversible decision from the item's and the user's Trash directory's
  `execute::VolumeId`s — `TrashStrategy::Move` (a single same-volume `fs_rename`
  carrying the item into Trash intact, recoverable until emptied) when they
  share a volume, else `TrashStrategy::Unlink` (the existing `DeleteWalk` path,
  since a rename cannot cross a volume, exactly as `mv` decides from `st_dev`) —
  reusing the same volume identity `paste_strategy` compares, one definition
  (§2.2). `trash_dest_path(trash_dir, leaf, taken)` resolves a collision-free
  home inside Trash: the original leaf when free, else the smallest ` (n)`
  disambiguation inserted before the extension (`notes (2).txt`) via the one
  shared `icon::extension` split (§2.2). It never clobbers an existing trashed
  item (§2.24) and is fail closed — `RootTrash` (an empty/root Trash dir),
  `InvalidName` (a bad original leaf), `TooLong` (a disambiguation past
  `FS_NAME_MAX`), and `NoFreeName` past the fixed `MAX_TRASH_NAME_ATTEMPTS`
  bound (§5.4, §24.4). The model touches no filesystem and holds no authority
  (the app performs the `fs_stat`/`fs_rename` under the user's own identity, no
  new capability), so composing it grants nothing and the read-only picker never
  runs it. Host-tested in `lib/browse` (same-/cross-volume strategy, free-name
  passthrough, extension-aware and whole-name and dotfile disambiguation,
  suffix-skipping over taken names, and each fail-closed refusal). Docs:
  `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.
- **FM10b — the app-side Trash verb + the QEMU witness.** The
  `files.app` `Run` binary, on a confirmed delete, decides one disposition for
  the whole plan (a selection lives in one directory, hence one volume): it
  resolves the user's home from the exported `HOME`, spells the fixed
  `Library/Trash` subtree with the shared `trash::trash_dir` (honouring the
  fixed `/Users/<u>/` shape — Trash is *inside* `Library/`, never a new
  sibling, §16.3), ensures that directory exists (`fs_mkdir` of `Library` then
  `Trash`, the user's own authority), and — when Trash and every target share a
  volume — resolves each target's collision-free `trash_dest_path`. On confirm
  a recoverable removal is a `Job::Trash` (one `fs_rename` per target into
  Trash, driven by the same interleaved progress/cancel runner as delete/paste,
  `ProgressOp::Trash`); an unavailable or cross-volume Trash falls back, fail
  closed, to the existing `DeleteWalk` unlink. The confirmation `Dialog` is
  disposition-aware (`DeleteDisposition` threaded into the shared
  `render::build_delete_dialog`): a safe, recoverable *Move to Trash* vs the
  destructive *Delete Permanently*, so the wording always matches what will
  happen (§2.24). The prerequisite — the desktop session forwarding the user
  environment (incl. `HOME`) to its launched apps (`spawn_app` → `spawn_with`);
  plain `spawn` gave a child an empty environment — lands in the same change
  (§2.19). Rides the aarch64 `autoload_input` QEMU vertical: its tenth witness
  changed from `FsNodeMutated op=rmdir` to `op=rename` whose `to` is under
  `Library/Trash` (still gated after the FM9-b `fd_redeem`, so no earlier
  mutation can satisfy it — fail closed).

### FM11 — emptying the Trash

FM10 made a delete recoverable by moving items into the per-user Trash; FM11
gives the user the deliberate way back to a permanent removal — emptying it.
Because the move that fills the Trash now exists, emptying it is real surface,
not speculative (§2.4). Split (§2.19) into the pure engine model and the app
wiring, exactly as FM6/FM7/FM8/FM10 were.

- **FM11a — the pure empty-Trash model.**
  `lib/browse::trash::empty_trash_plan(trash_dir, children)`, host-proven ahead
  of the app verb exactly as the pure delete/paste/trash models landed. It turns
  an `fs_readdir` listing of the Trash directory into a `delete::DeletePlan`
  over its *contents* — one target per immediate child, in
  listing order — never the Trash directory itself, so emptying removes the
  contents and leaves the now-empty folder in place. The removal is carried out
  by the *same* recursive `DeleteWalk` an ordinary permanent delete uses, so
  there is no second removal engine (§2.2), and it is always permanent (there is
  no trash-of-the-trash), so the app confirms it with
  `DeleteDisposition::Permanent`. It returns `None` for an already-empty Trash —
  a no-op the app simply does not offer, never an error — and is fail closed: a
  root Trash dir (`RootTrash`) or an invalid child leaf (`InvalidName`) refuses
  the whole empty rather than remove outside Trash or silently skip an item
  (§5.4). The model touches no filesystem and holds no authority (the app drives
  the plan's walk with its own `fs_readdir`/`fs_unlink` under the user's own
  identity, no new capability), so composing it grants nothing and the read-only
  picker never builds one. Host-tested in `lib/browse` (contents-not-the-dir
  removal preserving listing order and directory-backed flags, empty=no-op
  `None`, root-trash refusal, invalid-child refusal across `""`/`.`/`..`/`a/b`/
  `a:b`). Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.
- **FM11b — the app-side empty-Trash verb + the navigable Trash view.** Two
  manager-only toolbar tools join the `chrome::ManagerTool`
  vocabulary (drawn only for the write-capable file manager, never the read-only
  picker), each carrying a new `lib/icon` built-in glyph (`IconKind::Trash` /
  `IconKind::EmptyTrash`, host-tested as the FM3 file-type glyphs were):
  - **Go to Trash** (`ManagerTool::Trash`) — the navigable Trash view. The
    `files.app` `Run` binary resolves the user's home from `HOME`, ensures the
    fixed `Library/Trash` subtree (shared `trash::trash_dir`, §16.3), and
    navigates there with the new `Browser::navigate_to(components)` — the
    jump-to-an-arbitrary-location primitive (neither an ancestor nor a listed
    child), transactional and fail closed like every other navigation, so the
    Trash's contents show like any directory. Always offered; an absent home or
    unreachable Trash is stated on `stderr`, not hidden (§2.24).
  - **Empty Trash** (`ManagerTool::EmptyTrash`) — enabled only when the current
    directory *is* the user's Trash and it is non-empty (a new
    `chrome::ManagerToolModel` the app computes from `HOME`, since the engine
    does not know it; threaded through `render`/`manager_tool_at` so a disabled
    tool renders muted and a click on it resolves to nothing, §5.4). Clicking it
    re-reads the Trash (recomputing the location so a stale click can never
    empty the wrong directory), builds `empty_trash_plan`, confirms with the
    `DeleteDisposition::Permanent` dialog, and drives the plan's `DeleteWalk`
    through the same interleaved progress/cancel runner a delete uses
    (`ProgressOp::Delete`), under the user's own `fs_readdir`/`fs_unlink` (no new
    capability). An already-empty Trash is a silent no-op; a refusal is stated
    fail-loud on `stderr`.

  Host-tested in `lib/browse` (`navigate_to` off-spine/no-op/fail-closed; the
  Empty Trash tool disabled-vs-enabled hit-test gating) and the freestanding
  files app builds and lints clean. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
  `lib/browse/README.md`, `lib/icon/README.md` + rustdoc.
- **FM11c — the QEMU witness for the empty-Trash click-through.**
  Proves the Empty Trash verb end-to-end on the aarch64 `autoload_input` QEMU
  vertical with a new eleventh witness. After FM10b's move-to-Trash `op=rename`,
  the host runner clicks the **Go to Trash** tool (navigating the front files
  window into `Library/Trash`, now holding the trashed folder), the **Empty
  Trash** tool (opening the *Delete Permanently* confirmation), and the dialog's
  Delete button — each point reconstructed from the app's own layout
  (`render::manager_tool_rect` for the tools, `empty_trash_plan` →
  `build_delete_dialog(Permanent)` → `Dialog::action_rects` for the confirm
  button, §2.2). The guest PASS latches a further `FsNodeMutated op=rmdir`
  whose `path` is under `Library/Trash`, gated on the FM10 move having latched.
  The whole empty burst is gated on the one-shot `FM11_TRASH_FILLED_MARKER` the
  test kernel emits the first time it observes the move latch, so the clicks
  land only after the folder is provably in the Trash (Empty Trash enabled) and
  no earlier removal can satisfy the witness — fail closed. Contract markers
  live beside the guest PASS gate (`FM11_TRASH_FILLED_MARKER` in the vertical
  crate's `lib.rs`), so the script and its observer cannot drift (§2.2).

### FM12 — pointer activation gestures

Three gestures and one menu row drive the one `activate` dispatch a
keyboard `Enter` uses, so pointer and keyboard can never open different things
(§2.2):

| gesture | what it does |
|---|---|
| double-click / `Enter` | activate: descend, run a bundle, or open a file |
| shift-double-click / `Shift+Enter` | list a bundle's contents instead of running it |
| right-click | ask the desktop for the context menu on the item |
| the **Open and Close** menu row | activate, then close this window |

There is no right-*double*-click. The menu the first press opens is the
desktop's chain and holds the seat's grab, so the second press is consumed there
and never reaches this app — a property of the design, not a gap
(`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D20). The verb it carried is a menu row instead:
discoverable, and reachable from the keyboard as the gesture never was.

- **The pure detector.** `tairix_input::click::DoubleClickTracker` is the
  one host-proven rule that turns a stream of presses into single- and
  double-click gestures (`ClickKind`). `register(now_ns, index, button,
  interval)` pairs a press with the previous one only when it lands on the
  **same** item with the **same** button within the desktop's published
  double-click interval (`DesktopInfo::double_click`), so one
  press of each button is two gestures begun rather than one completed; a
  completed double *consumes* both presses (a third quick press begins a fresh
  single — standard triple-click semantics), a non-monotonic clock reading fails
  closed to a single, and `reset` breaks the pair when an intervening
  interaction (a chrome click) interrupts it. It holds no authority and does no
  I/O — the caller supplies the hit-test index, the button, and the timestamp —
  so it is fully host-tested and the read-only picker can compose it for free
  (§2.2). `PointerButton` is re-exported from `lib/browse` because it is now
  part of that surface.
- **The bundle intent.** `lib/browse::BundleIntent` (`Launch` / `Browse`)
  is what `activate_selected`/`activate_index` take: a bundle is both a program
  and a directory, so the caller names what the *gesture* meant while
  dispatch-by-kind stays in the engine. `Browse` descends by the entry's own
  name (through the link, when it is one) via the shared `descend_index`
  `open_index` already used, and returns `Descended`.
- **The app's own gesture decisions.** `files.app`'s `gesture` module is
  pure and host-tested, mirroring how `command` keeps the freestanding binary's
  decisions testable: `bundle_intent(shift)` (one spelling, so the pointer and
  `Shift+Enter` cannot diverge), `primary_press` (which resolves a press to
  `Activate`/`Select`/`Chrome`, registering against the tracker and resetting it
  on a press that resolves to no item), and `AfterHandoff` (whether a completed
  hand-off closes the window). The secondary-press decision is gone with the
  gesture it resolved: a right-press asks the desktop for the menu and resets
  the tracker, so a click either side of it cannot pair.
- **The app wiring.** `apply_primary_press` is a thin router over those
  decisions and `open_context_menu` is the secondary press's whole answer; the
  shift modifier arrives on the pointer event itself
  (`WindowEvent::Pointer`'s `modifiers`). Open and Close closes the window only
  on a `LaunchBundle`/`OpenFile` — a `Descended` is the window's new content, so
  closing it would leave the user with nothing, which is why the row is offered
  only over a file or a bundle and states its reason otherwise.
  `open_context_menu` takes the caller's already-resolved index, so a press
  costs one hit-test. Docs: `docs/src/desktop/apps.md`,
  `docs/src/desktop/menus.md`, `lib/browse/README.md` + rustdoc.

### FM13 — the places / devices sidebar

The vertical shortcuts rail down the left of the manager's window that
`plans/desktop1.png` shows, listing the user's own places and every mounted
volume with an icon matching the **real** storage medium.

- **The model.** `lib/browse::places` is pure: `Place`/`PlaceKind`/
  `Volume`/`Places`, built from the caller's home components plus a list of
  volumes — never I/O. One deterministic order (Home, Desktop, Documents,
  Apps, System, a separation, then volumes sorted stably by label). A volume
  is validated fail closed and simply dropped when its label is empty,
  over-long, or holds a control character, when its target is not an
  absolute parseable path, or when it duplicates another; a stale row is
  never fabricated. Interaction state (cursor, focus, hover, unavailable)
  lives on the model so every state the shared `ListRow` offers is
  reachable.
- **The geometry.** `layout::SidebarView` is the one definition of the
  rail's width (derived from the theme/font metrics, clamped to a third of
  the window), its row rectangles, its separator, and the hit-test that
  inverts them — shared by paint and hit-test, never computed twice. The
  rows are laid out unscrolled and shown through a `ScrollView`, so a rail
  longer than the window scrolls rather than dropping its last rows: a bar
  carved from its trailing edge while it does, moved by the rail's own
  `ScrollColumn` (the column the listing's bar is), and a hit-test that
  resolves a window point through the view. The rail sits below the
  window-wide toolbar band; the list/grid and its scrollbar are inset by it;
  with no rail the frame is exactly what it was. Building it exposed
  and fixed a latent defect: `ListView`/`GridView`'s `index_at` were not
  origin-aware while their rect builders were, so both now invert through
  one shared helper.
- **The medium is data, not a guess.** The app reads the ungated
  `MOUNT_LIST` sysinfo query through `lib/procinfo`, keeps the available
  mounts, and maps each record's `medium()` through
  `tairix_icon::disk_icon` — rotational, solid-state and removable to their
  shipped artwork, paravirtual **or unknown** to the generic drive glyph.
  Threading that medium from the block device through the kernel mount
  table onto the record is `plans/ICONS.md` I6.
- **The behaviour.** Pointer press focuses the rail and navigates; the
  rail's bar and a wheel turn over the rail scroll it; Tab moves focus
  between rail and file view; arrows move the cursor (clamped), scrolling it
  into view, and Enter navigates; Escape leaves the rail; keys the rail must
  not steal (unfocused arrows, key releases, the window's accelerators, which
  the app's `chrome::Accelerator` names once for the rail and the listing
  alike) fall through, and Alt+Enter navigates nowhere. The window records the
  pointer for every pointer event, rail or no rail, and the lit row follows
  the rows: a round that scrolls them re-lights it, and a whole repaint
  finds it again. A place that will not list states the reason on `stderr`,
  marks that row unavailable, and leaves the browser exactly where it was.
  The routing is host-visible (`userland/apps/files/src/sidebar.rs`) and
  host-tested rather than stranded in the freestanding module.
- **Refresh.** The rail converges on the kernel's `Mounts` system
  notice (`plans/NOTICE.md`): an attach, a re-backing, or a removal wakes the
  manager, which re-reads the rail through its existing reader desk (the mount
  table comes from the System Information service, so it is never read on the
  event loop) and redraws every window's rail when the answer lands. F5 and
  the Refresh tool remain the explicit ask, through the same desk and the same
  landing. Focus, cursor and scroll survive the rebuild; no timer and no
  polling loop.
- The trusted picker composes the same renderer with no rail
  (`ManagerChrome::none()`): it is a read-only one-shot over a caller-chosen
  start location, and a machine-wide device rail is neither its job nor
  within the authority it is given.

## 2. Sequencing and dependencies

FM1→FM2a→FM2b→FM3 build the shared engine + views + icons (host-proven;
FM2a repaints the list, FM2b adds the icon grid). FM4a adds the engine
navigation model (the history); FM4b paints the chrome and grows the
context menu alongside the actions it invokes (FM5–FM8), so no menu entry is
built ahead of its behaviour (§2.4). FM5 is the first write and the template for
FM7. FM6a models the activation decision (host-proven); FM6b (launch/open) acts
on it, depends on FM3 (bundle/file kinds), and reuses AW5 delegation. FM7 is
split (§2.19): FM7a models the selection + clipboard in the engine
(host-proven); FM7b executes the verbs in the app and depends on FM4b's
selection/menu. FM8 is split the same way: FM8a models the properties view
(host-proven); FM8b paints it and adds permission editing. FM9 closes out the
core with the autoload QEMU vertical. FM10 makes delete recoverable (move to
Trash), and FM11 gives the way back — emptying the Trash (FM11a the pure model,
FM11b the app verb + navigable Trash view, FM11c the QEMU witness), each split
the same way and depending on the FM7 delete walk it reuses (§2.2). FM12 adds
the pointer double-click gesture (the pointer pass FM6b deferred), reusing the
FM6 `activate` dispatch so pointer and keyboard never diverge. FM13 adds the
places/devices rail, depending on FM3's classification for its artwork and on
the storage medium `plans/ICONS.md` I6 threads onto the mount record. Each lands
fully gated; a stage that turns out larger than one clean increment is split and
staged here, never shipped half-done "for now" (§2.19).

## 3. What this explicitly refuses to become

To stay best-in-class and bloat-free (§2.3), the file manager will **not**
grow: a built-in text/image editor (that is what associated apps and CU6
delegation are for), a search-indexer daemon, cloud/account integration, a
ribbon or customisable-toolbar framework, per-file-type plug-in surfaces,
or a second theming/rendering path. Anything that belongs to another
subsystem (viewers, the shell, the storage resolver) is *reached*, not
reimplemented here.

The **Network view** is that rule, not an exception to it: the manager reaches
`lib/discovery` exactly as it reaches the mount table, renders the answer
through the existing list/grid, and hands a chosen share to the storage
resolver to mount — it holds no discovery protocol, no second renderer, and no
synthetic network path. It is filtered to storage-class service types, so it
is also not a general service browser. The design and its stages are
`plans/ZEROCONF.md` §6 (Z8, Z9), which owns their status.
