# FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES — Boot-time CPU feature detection and self-optimising routine selection

Status: **in progress** — P0 (build-time floor), P1 (the `cpufeatures`
/`cpucycles` Arch HAL slices), the P2 **framework crate** (`lib/cpuops`,
foundational-complete), and the P2 **first consumer + delivery** done: the
`lib/crc32c` CRC-32C family (portable baseline + per-arch `crc32c*`/SSE4.2
candidates, `lib/cpuops`-selected + self-verified + host-fuzzed), the
migration-safe common-`CpuFeatureSet` delivery (kernel folds each core's set
into an intersection, stamps it into every `ProcessStart`, exposes it via
`lib/rt::cpu_features`), the `kernel/core` bring-up resolve+audit
(`AuditEvent::CpuOpsRoutineSelected`), and the ARXFS `physical_checksum`
consumer (FNV-1a → CRC-32C, on-disk trailer 8→4). The P2 **crypto-availability
consumer** is also done: `lib/crypto::backend` is the authoritative SHA-256
backend-availability decision routed through `lib/cpuops` as an
availability-only (`ByPriority`, never benchmarked) family, whose mandatory
self-verify is a boot-time FIPS-180-4 known-answer self-test (POST) of the live
SHA-256 path; `kernel/core` records the decision and **halts** on a POST failure
(`AuditEvent::CryptoSelfTestFailed`), the FIPS discipline. It does not fork the
crypto computation (§2.12 forbids hand-rolling; the audited `sha2` crate owns
backend selection): the crate detects through `cpufeatures`, which answers
nothing on `target_os = "none"`, so no TAIRiX target reaches a hardware SHA-256
path and the honest software answer is recorded everywhere
(`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D361). Recovering hardware crypto awaits a **vetted,
driveable audited backend** — a supply-chain decision, deliberately not faked
(D363).

The P3 **page-zero** consumer is also done: `lib/pagezero` is a capability-gated
(`ByPriority`) family — portable byte-fill baseline + per-arch hardware
candidates (aarch64 `DC ZVA` cache-block zero, x86_64 ERMS `rep stosb`), gated
on the new `DcZva`/`Erms` `CpuFeatureSet` bits, `lib/cpuops`-selected +
self-verified + host-fuzzed. The `kernel/mem` frame scrub (`zero_frame` /
`fill_frame`: zero-before-map and the zero-on-free secret scrub) routes through
it, and `kernel/core::cpuops::resolve_accelerated_ops` resolves it once against
the finalised common set and audits the choice (`CpuOpsRoutineSelected`).

**A design correction landed with it (§2.13, no staged migration):** page-zero
was listed below under `ByBenchmark`; that is wrong. A block-zero primitive is
unconditionally better when present and bit-identical, so it is chosen by
*capability* (`ByPriority`), never a benchmark — exactly as Linux selects
`DC ZVA`/ERMS by feature. `memcpy`/`memset` fall in the same bucket where a
hardware fill/copy dominates. The plan is corrected accordingly below.

Remaining: that aarch64 hardware-crypto backend; the genuine **`ByBenchmark`**
demonstration (below); and P4 (matrix + burn-down). Design fixed below.

**Open design question for the `ByBenchmark` axis (must be resolved before its
consumers land, §15.7).** The family where a benchmark genuinely decides (the
raid6/xor case: best SIMD width varies by microarch) is the RFC-1071 IP
checksum (`lib/net`) — **userland**, while the bounded microbenchmark measures
over the Arch HAL `CpuCycles` counter, which is **kernel-only**: there is no
mechanism today for a user-space process to obtain a per-core-type "fastest
routine" decision. The framebuffer blit/blend/fill families select on the
capability axis instead (P3c), so they are not waiting on this.
Resolving this needs a deliberate design (e.g. `lib/rt` benchmarks its own
candidates at startup keyed by the delivered feature set over a cycle-counter
access path, or the kernel measures per core type and delivers the winners),
which is a separate, ABI-touching sub-plan — not started. The plan's former
XOR/parity `ByBenchmark` family is **dropped** until a real RAID/FEC/parity
consumer exists (a family with no caller is speculative/dead surface, §2.4);
`lib/cpuops`'s `ByBenchmark` policy + `BenchHarness` remain fully implemented
and host-tested against a fake counter, ready for the first real consumer.

Binding under `AGENTS.md` (§3, §15.18). This plan turns the standing
performance defect — *every* TAIRiX image is built and run against the
lowest-common-denominator baseline of its architecture and never uses the
extra instructions or the faster routine the booted CPU actually offers —
into a first-class, modular, boot-time hardware-feature framework that is
**better than Linux's** `raid6_algos` / `xor` self-benchmark and its
`alternatives`/ifunc feature dispatch, because it splits the two decisions
Linux tangles together and makes both auditable, deterministic where
correctness demands it, and fail-closed.

The framework selects, once per boot per distinct core type, the best
*correct* implementation of each accelerated operation (CRC32, IP/RFC-1071
checksum, `memcpy`/`memset`/page-zero, framebuffer blit/blend/fill,
XOR/parity, and the crypto-backend *availability* decision) from a registry
of candidates, using: (1) a deterministic **capability gate** read from CPU
ID registers, (2) a mandatory **self-verify** against a portable reference,
and (3) either declared **priority** or a bounded **microbenchmark** — with
a portable baseline that is always feature-legal and always the last resort,
so the system never traps on a missing instruction and never panics.

## Read first (§15.18)

- `AGENTS.md` §2.16 (performance is first-class), §2.20/§2.21 (platform
  neutrality; least arch-specific code), §5.4/§2.9 (fail closed, no panic),
  §17.2 (Arch HAL is a closed trait set), §17.5 (`cfg-check`/`deps-check`),
  §18.1 (the hardware tree is the discovery precedent), §19.1/§2.12 (crypto
  constant-time; audited backends), §19.4 (audit log), §27 (foundational
  implementations are complete, not minimal).
- `kernel/arch/api/src/lib.rs` — how the closed HAL trait set is assembled
  and re-exported; the `conformance` vertical pattern.
- `kernel/arch/api/src/memtag.rs` and `kernel/arch/api/src/sidechannel.rs`
  — the template for a new closed HAL slice with honest
  `Supported`/`Unsupported(reason)`/`Pending(note)` profiles and a
  per-slice `conformance::run_all`.
- `kernel/arch/api/src/timer.rs` and `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/apic_timer.rs`
  (`Rdtsc`) — the timer surface and the existing x86_64 cycle reader the
  benchmark harness must generalise into a HAL cycle-counter primitive.
- `kernel/arch/api/src/platform.rs` (`PlatformDiscovery`/`HwNodeSink`) — the
  §18.1/§18.2 discovery precedent this framework mirrors for CPUs.
- `.cargo/config.toml`, `tools/xtask/src/commands.rs`,
  `tools/xtask/src/commands/pie_build.rs` — the build-time floor layer
  (`-C target-cpu`/`target-feature`), which this plan **layers under**, not
  replaces.
- `lib/crypto`, `lib/net` (RFC-1071 checksum), the ARXFS record-checksum
  path, `lib/raster` (blit/blend/fill, P3c) — the first consumers.

## The defect (why the status quo is unacceptable)

1. **Build-time floor only, and set to the baseline.** Nothing in the tree
   sets `-C target-cpu`/`target-feature`, so LLVM emits `target-cpu=generic`
   — plain ARMv8.0-A on the Cortex-A72 RPi4 image, generic x86-64 on the
   ISO. CRC32, the AArch64 crypto extension (AES/PMULL/SHA1/SHA2), NEON/AVX
   widths, and the core scheduling model are all left unused on exactly the
   §2.16 hot paths (crypto, checksums, allocator, FS/net, compositor).

2. **A single generic-per-arch image cannot bake in any optional
   extension.** The product model is **one generic floor image per
   architecture, not per-board** (decided below): a single `aarch64`
   installation media that boots RPi 4, ClockworkPi CM4, OrangePi, and other
   ARMv8 SBCs, and a single `x86_64` ISO that boots arbitrary PCs, each
   working the hardware out at runtime from device-tree/ACPI discovery. The
   build-time floor is therefore forced to the *common* feature set of every
   SoC/PC that image must boot; anything above that floor is reachable
   **only** by runtime detection + dispatch. A universal `aarch64` image's
   floor is essentially baseline ARMv8.0-A (A53∩A72∩A76∩Allwinner∩… ≈
   baseline); the generic x86_64 ISO's floor is very low too (unknown PCs),
   yet a booted PC may have AES-NI/AVX2/SHA-NI. Runtime dispatch is what
   recovers, per booted CPU, everything the conservative floor gives up — so
   one image per arch loses nothing a per-board image would have gained.

3. **No mechanism exists to pick the faster of two equally-correct
   routines.** Even within one feature level, method X can beat method Y on
   core A and lose on core B (the raid6/xor case). TAIRiX has no framework
   to measure and choose, so it always ships one hard-coded choice.

**Scope note — the kernel binary is already universal; the *media* is the
real open work.** "One image per arch" is two questions with the same answer
for different reasons. The **kernel/CPU** half — one binary per arch that
adapts to any board by reading its device tree (`plans/PI.md` §0.2/§0.3:
boards of the same arch differ only in runtime-discovered data, never
`cfg(board=…)`) plus the build-time floor + runtime ceiling below — is
settled here. The **boot/firmware/DTB/media** half (a multi-board boot
partition carrying the single kernel plus every supported board's DTB and
each firmware family's loader, board-detect → DTB-select) is a packaging
problem that differs board-to-board and is owned by `plans/BOOTLOADER.md`
(and `plans/PI.md` for RPi-family specifics), **not** this plan. Per-board
images are a rare escape hatch for a board whose boot handoff genuinely
cannot be unified onto shared media, never the default.

The fix is **layered**, and both layers are mandatory:

- **Build-time floor (already the right home, just unset):** the compiler
  may emit the common-baseline instructions inline, image-wide. Chosen per
  image in `tools/xtask`/`tools/mkimage` (see P0), never as a `cfg` in
  shared source.
- **Runtime ceiling (this plan):** an ops table selects the
  extension-using or measured-fastest implementation *only on cores that
  have the extension*, baseline everywhere else.

## Goal / invariants (the design that survives review)

1. **Two axes, never conflated.** *Capability* ("does this core have the
   instruction?") is a deterministic fact read from CPU ID registers, never
   a benchmark. *Performance* ("which equally-correct, feature-legal
   implementation is fastest here?") is the only thing the benchmark
   decides. Benchmarking to discover whether an instruction exists is a
   defect; see also invariant 8 (crypto).

2. **Detection is arch-specific and lives behind a closed HAL slice.**
   Reading `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1`/`ID_AA64PFR0_EL1` (aarch64), `CPUID`
   (x86_64), `misa` + SBI/device-tree (riscv64), or the host capability
   query (wasm32) is target-divergent (§2.21) and belongs **only** under
   `kernel/arch/<target>/`, exposed through a new closed
   `kernel/arch/api/src/cpufeatures.rs` trait. The output is a normalised,
   arch-neutral `CpuFeatureSet` — the CPU analogue of the §18.1 hardware
   tree. No `cfg(target_arch)` leaks above the HAL (enforced by
   `cargo xtask cfg-check`, §17.5).

3. **The dispatch framework is generic and platform-neutral (§2.20).** The
   registry, selector, self-verify, benchmark harness, and ops-table type
   are one `no_std` `lib/*` crate (`lib/cpuops`) with **no** board/SoC/`cfg`
   reference. Adding it updates §3 and `PLAN.md`.

4. **Every candidate declares its required features; the gate is absolute.**
   A candidate is a filter-survivor only if *all* the `CpuFeatureSet` bits
   it requires are present. An unsupported instruction is never reached —
   that would trap. This is the correctness gate.

5. **Mandatory self-verify — an accelerated path with a bug is structurally
   unpickable.** Every filter-survivor is run against the portable
   reference over a fixed vector of sizes, alignments, and edge cases; a
   candidate whose output differs on any input is *rejected*, never
   selected. This is also the regression-test hook (P4).

6. **Fail closed, never panic (§5.4/§2.9).** The portable baseline is
   always the last-registered candidate, always feature-legal, and always
   self-verifies. If everything above it is filtered or rejected, the
   baseline wins. Selection never panics and never busy-waits (§2.23).

7. **Select once into an ops table; do not runtime-patch.** The winner per
   family is stored as a struct of `extern "C" fn` pointers consumed on the
   hot path. A select-once fn-pointer table avoids the W^X churn (§19.2) of
   Linux-style code patching and is far simpler. The indirect-call cost is
   *measured* (§2.16), not assumed; only if a specific ultra-hot path
   provably cannot afford the indirect call is patching reconsidered, with
   evidence and a stop-and-ask (§15.7).

8. **Crypto is capability-gated only — never benchmarked, never "fastest"
   (§19.1/§2.12).** For anything touching a secret, selection is
   *availability* only: hardware AES/PMULL/SHA present → the audited
   constant-time hardware backend; else the audited constant-time software
   backend. A "fastest AES" benchmark would happily pick a table-driven
   variant that leaks keys through cache timing — a §2.17 security
   regression. The `ByBenchmark` axis is restricted to routines that are
   (a) bit-identical in output and (b) handle no secret and have no
   timing-security requirement.

9. **Per-core-type, because cores are not uniform (§4 SMP).** big.LITTLE and
   heterogeneous SMP mean a measurement on the boot CPU does not describe
   another cluster. Results are keyed by CPU model / core type; the ops
   table is per-core-type (or per-cluster), resolved as each CPU comes up,
   never measured once and imposed globally.

10. **Deterministic, observable, pinnable.** The chosen implementation per
    family per core type is logged through the audit log (§19.4) with a
    stable event ID, and a boot parameter can *pin* a specific
    implementation. Builds stay bit-reproducible (§19.3); only runtime
    *selection* varies, and pinning makes it deterministic for CI,
    debugging, and reproducible-build validation.

11. **Foundational-complete from the start (§27).** The registry, both
    selection policies (`ByPriority` and `ByBenchmark`), the mandatory
    self-verify, per-core-type keying, pinning, and logging are all present
    in the first landed increment — not a one-family, one-policy slice.

## Layering (where each piece lives)

```
lib/cpuops                     generic: CpuFeatureSet consumer, Family/Candidate
  (no_std, no cfg, no SoC)     registry, Selector (filter→verify→choose),
                               BenchHarness, OpsTable<T>, pin/log seams.
kernel/arch/api/cpufeatures    closed HAL trait: read CpuFeatureSet + cycle
                               counter; conformance vertical.
kernel/arch/api/cpucycles      (or fold into timer.rs) arch-neutral cycle-
                               counter primitive for the bench harness.
kernel/arch/<target>/          the ONLY place that reads ID registers/CPUID/
                               misa/host query; per-port cycle counter.
concrete routines              portable ones in the owning lib/*/kernel/*;
                               ISA-divergent ones under kernel/arch/<target>/,
                               each gated on a discovered feature bit — one
                               generic impl per bit, never copy-pasted per arch.
kernel/core                    the single point that builds the per-core-type
                               ops tables at bring-up and hands them to consumers.
.cargo + tools/xtask/mkimage   build-time floor: image → target-cpu/feature.
```

## Phases (ordered, each independently reviewable and complete)

**Phase dependencies.** P0 is independent (build-layer only) and can land
first or in parallel. P1 (the `cpufeatures`/`cpucycles` HAL slices) is the
prerequisite for P2 and P3 and depends on nothing but the existing HAL. P2
(the `lib/cpuops` framework + first `ByPriority` consumers) depends on P1's
`CpuFeatureSet`. P3 (the `ByBenchmark` axis) depends on P2's selector seam
*and* P1's `CpuCycles` counter. P4 (fuzz/docs/burn-down) depends on whatever
consumers P2/P3 landed. Each phase ends only when the whole-project §7 gate
is green (§2.15); the per-phase **Acceptance** blocks state the phase-local
bar on top of that.

### P0 — Build-time floor (the layer under everything) — **done**

The per-image CPU floor lives in `tools/xtask/src/floor.rs` (declared
`mod floor;` in `tools/xtask/src/main.rs`): the single source of truth for
the `-C target-cpu`/`-C target-feature` baseline each image is compiled
against. It is injected per image at the point each image's binaries are
built (never in the shared `.cargo/config.toml` `[target.*]` blocks, which
are consumed by every build for that triple and would leak a floor across
images).

**Shape.** `enum ImageKind { AArch64Generic, X86_64Iso, Riscv64Generic,
AArch64Virt }` (each carries its triple); `struct CpuFloor { target_cpu:
Option<&str>, target_features: &[&str], rationale: &str, triple: &str }`;
`floor_for_image(ImageKind) -> CpuFloor` is total over `ImageKind`.
`CpuFloor::floor_tokens()` yields the floor-only `-C target-cpu`/`-C
target-feature` tokens (empty for a baseline floor); `CpuFloor::rustflags()`
= `base_rustflags(triple)` ⧺ floor tokens; `CpuFloor::encoded_rustflags()`
is that joined by `0x1f` for `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`.

**Flag precedence + the divergence guard.** `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`
*replaces* (does not merge with) the config `[target.*]` `rustflags` block,
so `base_rustflags(triple)` reproduces the flags that block supplies
(`-C force-frame-pointers=yes` on the bare-metal targets; plus the x86_64
kernel code and relocation models). The `base_rustflags_match_cargo_config`
unit test
parses `.cargo/config.toml` and pins the two together, so they can never
diverge (§2.2).

**Wiring.** The kernel builds (`build_platform_image` → `AArch64Generic`,
`build_virt_run_kernel` → `AArch64Virt`) set `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS =
floor.encoded_rustflags()`. The PIE recipe (`cross_compile_pie_elf`)
*prepends* `floor.floor_tokens()` to its link recipe, resolving the floor
purely from its `PieArch` via `ImageKind::generic_for_pie_arch` (every
bundle is the generic per-arch user-space, so the floor is a pure function
of the arch — never a value carried two ways, §2.2/§2.3). Kernel and
user-space of the generic image therefore share one floor
(`generic_image_kernel_and_pie_share_one_floor`).

**Floor values (decided, at baseline).** `AArch64Generic`: baseline
ARMv8.0-A (`target_cpu: None`, no features) — the common set of every ARMv8
SBC the universal media boots. `X86_64Iso`: `target_cpu: Some("x86-64")`
(v1) for maximum reach; raised to `x86-64-v2` only with a documented minimum
requirement. `Riscv64Generic`: the base `rv64gc` the triple implies.
`AArch64Virt`: baseline (dev kernel, not shipped hardware). Everything above
the floor that a first-party family dispatches on is recovered per booted CPU
by P1–P3 runtime dispatch; the audited crypto crates' accelerated backends are
not (D363). The x86_64 floor may never imply VEX: the kernel frames only the
legacy SSE state on each entry and saves the rest only at a task's park, so
VEX-encoded kernel code would corrupt it
(`the_x86_64_floor_implies_no_extended_register_state` asks rustc). Because
every floor is baseline, the injected
flags reproduce the config byte-for-byte and the images build exactly as
before (verified: `cargo xtask ci`'s image gate builds the RPi image green).

**Codegen-validation obligation for a future floor-raise.** Any floor that
raises `target-cpu`/`target-feature` above the current default must be proven
to lower on the freestanding target before adoption. If enabling a feature
breaks codegen, **fail the build** (§2.1); never ship broken codegen and never
silently drop the feature. The decided floors stay at baseline, so nothing
raises codegen today.

**Product model (settled).** One generic floor image per architecture, not
per-board; hardware worked out at runtime via discovery (§18.1) and CPU
extensions via P1–P3 dispatch. Per-board images are a rare boot-layer escape
hatch owned by `plans/BOOTLOADER.md`, never the default.

### P1 — The `cpufeatures` Arch HAL slice (deterministic capability layer) — **done**

**Delivered.** Two closed HAL slices landed, modelled slot-for-slot on the
`memtag`/`sidechannel` slices, each with a `kernel/arch/api` conformance
vertical every port passes:

- `kernel/arch/api/src/cpufeatures.rs`: the `CpuFeatures` trait
  (`detect → CpuFeatureSet`, `core_type → CoreType`, `profile →
  FeatureProfile`), the closed `CpuFeature` enum (aarch64
  CRC32/AES/PMULL/SHA1/SHA2/SHA3/LSE/ASIMD/DIT, x86_64
  SSE2/SSSE3/SSE4.2/AVX/AVX2/AES-NI/PCLMULQDQ/SHA-NI/RDRAND/RDSEED,
  riscv64 Zbb/Zbc/Zbkc/V) with stable per-bit discriminants, the
  `CpuFeatureSet` bitset (`contains`/`contains_all`/`with`/`bits`), the
  `CoreType` per-core-type key (`raw_id` is the discriminator; `model`
  best-effort, `class` the homogeneous default), and the honest
  `FeatureProfile`/`FeatureSupport` (`Supported`/`Unsupported`/`Pending`)
  vocabulary — the last also being the reporting type a *probed* platform
  capability (e.g. the D13 watchdog's FIQ deliverability) uses.
- `kernel/arch/api/src/cpucycles.rs`: the `CpuCycles` trait
  (`cpu_cycles`, `cycles_monotonic_hint`) — its own slice, not grafted
  onto `timer.rs`.

Per-port impls (each the sole reader of its ID source; pure decoders
host-tested, register reads gated to `target_os = "none"`, host builds
report empty/unknown):

- x86_64 `cpufeatures.rs`: `CPUID` leaf 1 + leaf 7 decode, vendor +
  leaf-1 signature `CoreType`, `RDTSC` cycles (invariant-TSC hint).
- aarch64 `cpufeatures.rs`: `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1`/`ID_AA64PFR0_EL1` decode,
  `MIDR_EL1` `CoreType`, `CNTVCT_EL0` cycles (chosen over `PMCCNTR_EL0`
  to avoid PMU-enable boot wiring).
- riscv64 `cpufeatures.rs`: `misa` V bit + pure `riscv,isa`-string
  multi-letter (`Zbb`/`Zbc`/`Zbkc`) parser, `time`-CSR cycles (reuses the
  one `read_time()` the clock uses).
- wasm32 `cpufeatures.rs`: honest `Unsupported` (a guest sees no native
  ISA), empty detection, `performance.now()` cycles.

Wired into `conformance::run_all` (new `cpu_features` handle) and every
port's `passes_arch_hal_conformance_suite`; recorded in the §17.2 HAL
enumeration and `PLAN.md`. The design that was fixed below is kept for
reference by P2/P3.

**Deliverables — the HAL trait (`kernel/arch/api/src/cpufeatures.rs`):**

- `pub struct CpuFeatureSet(u64)` — an arch-neutral bitset with named,
  arch-tagged accessors so no raw bit index leaks to consumers. Members
  cover the extensions consumers actually gate on:
  - aarch64: `CRC32`, `AES`/`PMULL`, `SHA1`, `SHA2`, `SHA3`, `LSE` (atomics),
    `ASIMD`/NEON (baseline-present but represented for completeness), `DIT`.
  - x86_64: `SSE2`, `SSSE3`, `SSE4_2` (carries CRC32/`crc32` + `POPCNT`),
    `AVX`, `AVX2`, `AES` (AES-NI), `PCLMULQDQ`, `SHA` (SHA-NI), `RDRAND`,
    `RDSEED`.
  - riscv64: the `misa`/ISA-string extensions relevant now (`Zbb`, `Zbc`,
    `Zbkc`, the vector `V` extension) — represented honestly, most
    `Unsupported`/absent on today's QEMU virt.
  - Provide `pub const fn contains(self, feature: CpuFeature) -> bool` and a
    `CpuFeature` enum naming each bit, so a `Candidate`'s required-feature
    declaration (P2) is type-checked, never a magic mask.
- `pub struct CoreType { pub model: Option<&'static str>, pub class:
  CoreClass, pub raw_id: u64 }` — the per-core-type key P2/P3 hash on;
  reuses the existing `CoreClass` (`lib.rs`) and the existing per-port model
  decoders (`cpuname.rs::name_for_midr` on aarch64, `cpuname.rs` on x86_64).
  `raw_id` is MIDR_EL1 / CPUID signature / `mvendorid:marchid:mimpid`.
- `pub trait CpuFeatures: Send + Sync { fn detect(&self, cpu: CpuId) ->
  CpuFeatureSet; fn core_type(&self, cpu: CpuId) -> CoreType; fn profile(&self)
  -> FeatureProfile; }` — object-safe, `Send + Sync` (reached from every CPU),
  detection keyed by `CpuId` because heterogeneous SMP means per-CPU answers.
- `pub struct FeatureProfile` + `pub enum FeatureSupport {
  Supported, Unsupported(&'static str), Pending(&'static str) }` and
  `validate()`/`entries()`/`is_release_ready()` — the *identical* honesty
  pattern as `memtag::TaggingProfile`/`Tagging` (§19.10 template), so a port
  that cannot yet trust a probe declares it `Unsupported`/`Pending` with a
  justification rather than fabricating a bit.
- `pub mod conformance { pub fn run_all<C: CpuFeatures + ?Sized>(port: &C) }`
  — asserts: profile validates; `detect` is stable across back-to-back calls
  for one `CpuId`; a bit reported present is consistent with the profile;
  `core_type` is total and panic-free for an out-of-range `CpuId`. Wire into
  `kernel/arch/api/src/conformance.rs::run_all` (add a `cpufeatures`
  parameter alongside `memtag`/`percpu`).
- Re-export from `kernel/arch/api/src/lib.rs` (`pub use cpufeatures::{…}`)
  and add `pub mod cpufeatures;`.

**Deliverables — the HAL cycle counter (decision: its own tiny slice,
`kernel/arch/api/src/cpucycles.rs`, not folded into `timer.rs`):** `timer.rs`
is the tickless scheduler-tick surface and must not grow a benchmarking verb
(interface creep, §2.4). New `pub trait CpuCycles: Send + Sync { fn
cpu_cycles(&self) -> u64; fn cycles_monotonic_hint(&self) -> bool; }` with a
`conformance::run_all` proving the counter is non-decreasing across a short
busy window. Generalises the existing x86_64 `Rdtsc`
(`kernel/arch/x86_64/src/apic_timer.rs`/`tsc.rs`).

**Deliverables — per-port impls** (each is the ONLY place its ID source is
read — §17.2/§17.5 `cfg-check`):

- `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/cpufeatures.rs`: `CPUID` leaves 1 (ECX/EDX) and 7
  (EBX/ECX) → the bitset; reuse `cpuname.rs` for `model`; `cpu_cycles` = the
  existing `Rdtsc`.
- `kernel/arch/aarch64/src/cpufeatures.rs`: `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1` (AES/SHA/CRC32/
  atomics fields), `ID_AA64PFR0_EL1` (ASIMD); `core_type` from
  `cpuname.rs::name_for_midr` + `hetcore.rs` class; `cpu_cycles` =
  `PMCCNTR_EL0` (enable via `PMUSERENR`/`PMCR` at boot) or `CNTVCT_EL0`
  fallback if the PMU cycle counter is unavailable — record which in the
  profile.
- `kernel/arch/riscv64/src/cpufeatures.rs`: `misa` + the device-tree
  `riscv,isa` string (via `tairix_fdt`) for Z-extensions; `cpu_cycles` =
  `rdcycle`/`time` CSR.
- `kernel/arch/wasm32/src/cpufeatures.rs`: honest host query — most
  extensions `Unsupported("wasm host does not expose native ISA extensions")`;
  `cpu_cycles` via the host `performance.now()` binding already in
  `wasm32/src/bindings.rs`.
- Publish each port's handle where the other HAL handles are published
  (the port's `kernel_arch.rs` aggregation) so `kernel/core` can reach it at
  bring-up (P2).

**Record the new surface:** add `cpufeatures`/`cpucycles` to the §17.2 HAL
enumeration in `AGENTS.md` and to `PLAN.md`'s HAL list, and to the
`kernel/arch/api/src/lib.rs` module rustdoc (mirrors how `memtag`/`smp`
were recorded).

**Tests:**

- Host tests per port with a **fake ID source**: a decoder unit test that a
  synthetic `CPUID`/`ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1`/`misa` value yields the expected
  `CpuFeatureSet` (masking a field off is honoured — the bit disappears).
- `conformance::run_all` invoked from each port's existing `conformance`
  host test over its real handle.
- Cycle-counter conformance: monotonic within a measurement window (host
  double for the non-native side).

**Acceptance:** detection compiles and its decoders are host-tested on all
four ports; no `cfg(target_arch)` appears above the HAL (`cargo xtask
cfg-check` green); the HAL conformance vertical runs the new slice.

### P2 — The generic `lib/cpuops` framework (registry + `ByPriority` + self-verify + fail-closed baseline)

**Framework landed (design as built).** The `lib/cpuops` crate is complete and
foundational (§27), with these decisions refining the sketch below:

- The arch-neutral capability vocabulary (`CpuFeature`/`CpuFeatureSet`) lives in
  `tairix_abi::cpufeatures`, not in the HAL, so a `lib/*` crate can consume it
  without a forbidden `kernel/*` edge (§17.4); the HAL re-exports it. This is
  the one place both the ID-register *producer* (HAL) and the *consumer*
  (`lib/cpuops`) share the definition (§2.2), mirroring `tairix_abi::hwtree`.
- `FamilyId(&'static str)` is a stable string label, **not** a closed enum: the
  framework is generic over which families exist (a consumer declares its own),
  so a family enum would be speculative surface the framework does not own
  (§2.3/§2.4).
- The per-core-type key is `CoreKey(u64)` (the HAL `CoreType::raw_id`), so the
  framework needs neither `CoreType` nor `CoreClass` and stays `kernel/*`-free.
- `OpsTable` is `OpsTables<Ops>`, generic over the consumer's own struct of
  resolved fn pointers (the framework cannot name a consumer's op set), grown on
  demand per `CoreKey` (§24.1, not a fixed ceiling).
- The benchmark harness (P3) is included now — the crate is foundational-
  complete with **both** policies real — over a crate-local `CycleCounter` seam
  (`kernel/core` adapts the HAL `CpuCycles` to it) so the crate names no arch.
- Every `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` is kept out of the production path; the
  selector fails closed to the baseline (§2.9/§5.4).

Full host tests cover: feature-gate filtering, self-verify rejection,
fail-closed baseline (incl. no-vectors → `BaselineUnverified`), pin /
pin-rejected-illegal / pin-rejected-buggy / unknown-pin, `ByBenchmark` picking
the fastest over a deterministic fake counter (+ no-harness priority fallback,
tie-to-earliest, median outlier rejection), `OpsTables` grow-once-per-core-type,
and the `DecisionSink`.

**P2 done.** The `kernel/core` bring-up wiring finalises the migration-safe
common `CpuFeatureSet` (each core folds its own detected set into an
intersection) and, once final, resolves both P2 consumers and records each
`Decision` on the `lib/log` audit sink (`AuditEvent::CpuOpsRoutineSelected`):
the CRC-32C family (consumed by the in-kernel ARXFS `physical_checksum`) and the
crypto SHA-256 backend-availability family (`lib/crypto::backend`). The kernel
resolves its own families against
`CpuFeatureSet::without_extended_register_state`, so none is ever offered a
feature whose registers only a user task's park saves; a process's startup
vector carries the full set. The crypto
family additionally drives a fatal boot halt on a failed known-answer self-test
(`AuditEvent::CryptoSelfTestFailed`). The one thing P2 could not deliver — a
TAIRiX-fn-pointer-*routed* hardware crypto backend on any target — is blocked by
§2.12 (hand-rolling forbidden) plus the pinned audited crates (their
`cpufeatures` detection is inert on `target_os="none"` and exposes no driveable
override), so it awaits a **vetted, driveable audited backend** (a supply-chain
decision, D363), and the honest software answer is recorded meanwhile — never a
candidate that would not run (§2.19).

**Scope in one line:** a new `no_std` `lib/cpuops` crate holding the whole
selection abstraction (registry, self-verify, both policies, per-core-type
keying, pin, typed log), wired once in `kernel/core` bring-up, with CRC32 and
the crypto-availability decision as its first two consumers.

**Deliverables — the crate (`lib/cpuops/`; updates §3 layout + `PLAN.md`;
`README.md` stability tier `experimental`; `no_std`, no `cfg`, no SoC name —
§2.20):**

- `pub struct Candidate<T: Copy>` — one implementation: `{ name:
  &'static str, requires: &'static [CpuFeature], selection_hint: (), impl_:
  T }` where `T` is the op's `extern "C" fn` pointer type. `requires` is
  matched against the `CpuFeatureSet` (P1).
- `pub struct Family<'a, T: Copy, In>` — the op abstraction: `{ id:
  FamilyId, candidates: &'a [Candidate<T>], baseline: Candidate<T>,
  selection: Selection, reference: fn(&In) -> RefOut, run: fn(T, &In) ->
  RefOut, vectors: &'a [In] }`. `baseline` is separate and mandatory (always
  feature-legal, always last resort — invariant 6). `FamilyId` is a stable
  enum used as the log/pin key.
- `pub enum Selection { ByPriority, ByBenchmark }` (invariant 1).
- `pub struct Selector` — the algorithm, pure and host-testable:
  1. **filter** candidates whose `requires` ⊄ the core's `CpuFeatureSet`
     (invariant 4);
  2. **self-verify** each survivor: run it over every vector and compare to
     `reference`; reject on any mismatch (invariant 5);
  3. **choose**: `ByPriority` → first verified survivor in declared order;
     `ByBenchmark` → hand survivors to the P3 `BenchHarness` (a seam in P2, a
     real harness in P3);
  4. **fail closed**: if none survive, return `baseline` (invariant 6);
     never panic, never spin.
  Returns a `Selection Decision { family: FamilyId, chosen: &'static str,
  core: CoreType, reason: DecisionReason }` — a *typed* record, not a log
  call (the crate does no I/O; the caller logs it via `lib/log`, §19.4).
- `pub struct OpsTable` — the resolved struct-of-fn-pointers consumed on the
  hot path, built per `CoreType` (invariant 9). `pub struct OpsTables` keying
  `CoreType → OpsTable`, resolved as each CPU comes up.
- `pub struct Pin` / `pub fn apply_pin(&mut Selector, FamilyId, &str)` — the
  boot-parameter override (invariant 10): pin forces a named candidate but it
  **still self-verifies** (a pinned buggy candidate is rejected, falls to
  baseline — pinning cannot defeat correctness).
- `pub trait DecisionSink { fn record(&self, d: &Decision); }` — the injected
  log seam (capability-clean; `kernel/core` supplies a `lib/log`-backed impl).

- **Foundational-complete from the first commit (§27):** both policies, the
  mandatory self-verify, per-core-type keying, pin, and the typed decision
  sink are all present now — even though P2's two consumers use only
  `ByPriority`. A one-family/one-policy slice is the §27 defect and is
  rejected.

**Deliverables — first two consumers:**

- **CRC32 family.** Portable table-driven CRC32 is the `baseline`; the
  extension candidate uses the aarch64 `crc32*` instructions / x86_64
  `crc32` (`SSE4_2`) gated on the `CRC32`/`SSE4_2` bit. The ISA-divergent
  candidate bodies live under `kernel/arch/<target>/` (one impl per bit, not
  copy-pasted — §2.21); the portable baseline and the `Family` wiring live in
  the owning crate. Identify the current CRC32/`physical_checksum` consumer:
  ARXFS `drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/integrity.rs::physical_checksum` (a
  fast non-crypto checksum, explicitly *not* a crypto primitive) is the first
  real caller — route it through the ops table.
- **Crypto backend availability decision (capability-gated only — invariant
  8).** *No benchmark.* `lib/crypto::backend` is a `ByPriority` SHA-256 family:
  a hardware-availability candidate (offered only where the audited crate's own
  detection runs — a hosted `x86_64` build, never a TAIRiX target — via the
  `crypto_hw_sha256` build cfg, requiring the `ShaNi`/`Sse42`/`Ssse3`/`Sse2`
  bits `sha2` gates its SHA-NI path on) and the audited constant-time software
  baseline. Selection is *availability*, never speed, and the chosen backend
  still comes from the audited `lib/crypto` (§2.12) — the module does **not**
  fork the computation (the audited crate owns backend selection internally;
  transcribing SHA rounds over intrinsics would be hand-rolling, forbidden).
  Its mandatory self-verify is a **boot-time FIPS-180-4 known-answer self-test
  (POST)** of the live SHA-256 path; `kernel/core` halts on failure
  (`CryptoSelfTestFailed`). This proves the framework models the crypto
  carve-out — availability + self-test + audit, no benchmark near a secret —
  and honestly records `Software` on targets with no driveable hardware path.

**Deliverables — bring-up wiring (`kernel/core`):** the single point (§17.1
selection-point precedent) that, as each CPU comes up, reads the port's
`CpuFeatures` handle, builds/looks-up the `OpsTable` for that `CoreType`, and
records each `Decision` through the `lib/log` sink. Consumers fetch their
family's fn pointer from the per-CPU/per-core-type `OpsTable`.

**Tests:**

- Selector (host, fake `CpuFeatureSet` + fake vectors): filters on missing
  feature; rejects a deliberately-wrong candidate (verify catches it); falls
  back to baseline when all survivors rejected; honours a pin; a pinned
  *buggy* candidate still falls to baseline.
- Conformance: every CRC32 candidate is bit-identical to the reference across
  the fixed vector (empty, 1 byte, unaligned, page-crossing, max).
- Crypto family: selects the hardware backend only when the availability bit
  is set; never runs a benchmark (assert the `ByBenchmark` path is never
  entered for this family).

**Acceptance:** `lib/cpuops` lands complete (§27); CRC32 and crypto-avail
route through it; `kernel/core` builds per-core-type tables; whole-project
gate green; coverage ≥ 85% for the new `lib/*` crate (§7).

### P3a — Capability-gated fill/zero (`ByPriority`) — **done**

**Delivered.** The page-zero family (`lib/pagezero`) is a capability-gated
(`ByPriority`) consumer, resolved once at bring-up against the migration-safe
common feature set:

- New `DcZva` (aarch64, `DCZID_EL0.DZP`) and `Erms` (x86_64, `CPUID.7:EBX.9`)
  `CpuFeatureSet` bits + per-port detection (each the sole reader of its ID
  source; `dczva_usable` pure and host-tested).
- `lib/pagezero`: portable byte-fill baseline (`zero_portable`), aarch64
  `DC ZVA` candidate (reads the `DCZID_EL0` block size; head/aligned-middle/
  tail so it is correct for any base/length) and x86_64 ERMS `rep stosb`
  candidate, behind the `build.rs`-emitted `pagezero_<arch>` cfg (no
  `cfg(target_arch)` in source). Selected + self-verified (byte-identical to
  the fill over a fixed length/alignment vector, including that it zeroes
  *exactly* the region) + host-fuzzed, fail-closed to the baseline.
- Consumer: the `kernel/mem` frame scrub (`anon::zero_frame`,
  `spawn::fill_frame`) routes through `tairix_pagezero::zero`;
  `kernel/core::cpuops::resolve_accelerated_ops` resolves it once and audits
  the choice (`CpuOpsRoutineSelected`).

**Why `ByPriority`, not `ByBenchmark`:** a block-zero primitive is
unconditionally faster when present and bit-identical, so the choice is pure
capability (as in Linux). A single kernel-wide routine (one set-once fn
pointer, no per-call per-CPU table lookup) resolved against the *intersection*
set is correct because a kernel routine may migrate between cores.

### P3b — The `ByBenchmark` axis (bounded, deterministic boot microbenchmark)

**Status: blocked on an open design question — the harness is built, its real
consumers are not.** The `lib/cpuops` `BenchHarness` + `ByBenchmark` selection
policy are complete and host-tested against a fake counter (P2). What is *not*
done is a real consumer, because the families where a benchmark genuinely
decides are userland and the cycle counter is kernel-only (see the status
header). **Before P3b consumers land, the userland-measurement mechanism must
be designed and agreed (§15.7).**

**Scope in one line (once unblocked):** wire the userland measurement path,
then move the secret-free, bit-identical userland families onto `ByBenchmark`.

**Deliverables — the harness (`lib/cpuops/src/bench.rs`):**

- `pub struct BenchHarness<'c> { cycles: &'c dyn CpuCycles, iters: u32,
  rounds: u32 }` — takes the P1 `CpuCycles` handle by injection (the crate
  stays `no_std`/no-arch — §2.20). Fixed `iters` over a fixed, warmed input
  buffer; `rounds` measurements reduced by **median** (invariant: reject
  noise, never "loop until a threshold" — §2.1); bounded one-shot, no
  busy-wait (§2.23).
- `pub fn fastest<T: Copy, In>(&self, survivors: &[Candidate<T>], run: fn(T,
  &In) -> RefOut, warm: &In) -> usize` — returns the index of the lowest
  median cycle count; ties break to the earliest (lowest priority index) for
  determinism. Called by the `Selector::choose` `ByBenchmark` arm added in P2.
- Because measurement is inherently machine-dependent, the *only*
  nondeterminism the framework introduces is which verified-correct candidate
  wins; the pin (P2) makes even that deterministic when required (invariant
  10, §19.3 reproducibility).

**Deliverables — per-core-type measurement (invariant 9):** the bring-up
wiring (P2, `kernel/core`) benchmarks once per *distinct* `CoreType` /
cluster (big.LITTLE, Intel hybrid) as those CPUs come up, caching the result
in `OpsTables`; the boot CPU's result is never imposed on a different core
type.

**Deliverables — `ByBenchmark` consumers (secret-free, bit-identical only —
invariant 8; all pending the userland-measurement design above):**

- RFC-1071 IP checksum: `lib/net/src/checksum.rs`
  (`internet_checksum` / `Checksum::push`/`finish`) — a SIMD folding
  candidate vs the portable ones'-complement baseline. **Userland** — needs
  the measurement path.
- `memcpy` / `memset`: where a hardware fill/copy dominates unconditionally
  these belong on the *capability* axis with page-zero (P3a), not here; a
  `ByBenchmark` memcpy is warranted only if two feature-legal SIMD widths
  genuinely trade places by microarch, and only with a real caller.
- XOR/parity: **dropped** until a real RAID/FEC/parity consumer exists (a
  family with no caller is speculative/dead surface, §2.4). Land it *with*
  that consumer.
- Crypto stays strictly on the P1/P2 capability axis — **never** here.

**Deliverables — logging + pin:** each `Decision` (family × core type) is
recorded through the `lib/log` sink with a stable event ID (§19.4); the pin
boot parameter forces a named candidate for determinism (CI, debugging,
reproducible-build validation).

**Tests:**

- Harness (host, **fake** `CpuCycles`): bounded (fixed iters/rounds),
  deterministic under the fake, picks the faster of two fake candidates,
  median rejects an injected outlier, honours a pin, tie-breaks to earliest.
- Every benchmarked candidate is bit-identical to its reference across the
  fixed vector (empty/1/unaligned/page-crossing/max) — the correctness gate
  is independent of the speed choice.
- QEMU verticals per arch: the extension-using family is chosen when the
  feature is present and the baseline when the feature is masked off (via a
  test hook that forces a reduced `CpuFeatureSet`); heterogeneous-core keying
  exercised where the emulator models it (e.g. QEMU `-cpu` big.LITTLE combos).

**Acceptance:** the RFC-1071 IP checksum — the one family left where a
benchmark genuinely decides — routes through `ByBenchmark` over an agreed
userland-measurement path; measurement is bounded and never busy-waits; the pin
makes selection deterministic; whole-project gate green.

### P3c — Capability-gated raster kernels (`ByPriority`) — the Stage F home

**Scope in one line:** the `lib/raster` per-pixel families select their
candidate on the **capability** axis, not by measurement, so they are not
blocked on P3b.

**Why `ByPriority`, not `ByBenchmark`.** A packed-SIMD premultiplied `over` is
unconditionally faster than four scalar `div255`s, and it is bit-identical when
the vector form implements the same rounding. Nothing about that varies by
microarchitecture, so there is no decision for a benchmark to make — it is a
pure capability question, exactly as P3a argued for page-zero. Classifying
these families as `ByBenchmark` made them wait on a userland-measurement
mechanism they never needed.

**Why it works today, with no new mechanism.** `lib/rt`'s startup already
delivers the kernel-folded common `CpuFeatureSet` to user space
(`cpu_features()`), and `lib/cpuops` is a plain `lib/*` crate with no kernel
edge, so `ByPriority` selection inside `lib/raster` needs no kernel work, no
ABI change, and no new capability — the existing self-verify, fail-closed
baseline, pin and audit machinery applies unchanged.

**Deliverables.** The families, their order, and their per-target availability
are `plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md` Stage F, which owns the implementation. Its
F.1 has landed the source-level half and narrowed what a *candidate* is still
owed to two families — the blur's sliding-window add/sub/mean and `resample`'s
row filter, both of which need an instruction the portable form cannot express
— while `encode_run` is closed by measurement and `blend_span` /
`Surface::blit` / the compositor run loop already reached their portable
ceiling there. Each candidate follows the `lib/pagezero` shape P3a
established — a `build.rs`-emitted per-ISA cfg (never `cfg(target_arch)` in
source, so `cargo xtask cfg-check` stays green), a portable baseline registered
last and always feature-legal, the mandatory self-verify against that baseline
over a fixed size/alignment/alpha vector, host fuzzing, and the pin for
determinism.

**Per-target state.** aarch64 is unblocked today (NEON is baseline on
`aarch64-unknown-none`). x86_64 and riscv64 user space have no vector or float
state saved across a context switch, so their candidates wait on that
enablement — `plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md` Stage G and
`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D37. wasm32 stays baseline-only (`simd128` is not in
the target's baseline).

**Acceptance:** the raster families route through `ByPriority`; every candidate
is bit-identical to the baseline; the baseline is chosen when the feature bits
are masked off; the improvement is quoted from `cargo xtask bench`.

### P4 — Fuzzing, docs, and burn-down

**Scope in one line:** fuzz every accelerated routine against its reference,
document the framework, and update the support matrix — closing the plan.

**Deliverables — fuzzing (§19.6):**

- One `cargo-fuzz`/in-tree harness per family in `lib/cpuops` (and the arch
  candidate crates): feed arbitrary bytes/sizes/alignments to *every*
  candidate and assert bit-identity with the portable reference. A divergence
  or crash is a bug; the input enters the family's regression corpus with a
  unit test (§7).
- Add the new harnesses to `cargo xtask fuzz` (the `--quick` per-PR gate and
  the nightly soak) so they run in `cargo xtask ci`.

**Deliverables — docs (§2.8/§13):**

- New `docs/src/architecture/cpu-feature-dispatch.md` (add to
  `docs/src/SUMMARY.md`): the two axes, the crypto carve-out, per-core-type
  keying, pinning, and the build-time-floor-vs-runtime-ceiling layering
  diagram.
- The P0 image→floor rationale table added to the platform docs
  (`docs/src/platform/`).
- rustdoc on every public `lib/cpuops` and `cpufeatures`/`cpucycles` HAL item
  (the `deny(missing_docs)` in `kernel/arch/api` enforces the HAL half).

**Deliverables — matrix + burn-down:**

- Update the `README.md` feature/architecture support matrix (§13) with a
  per-target accelerated-path row (CRC32, crypto-HW, blit/memcpy).
- Flip this plan's Status to `done` with a concise done-state summary
  (§13 — plans hold current state, not history); confirm §17.2 / `PLAN.md`
  HAL enumeration lists `cpufeatures`/`cpucycles`.

**Acceptance:** every accelerated routine is fuzzed against its reference in
CI; docs build (`cargo xtask docs-check`) with no stale-symbol failures; the
support matrix reflects reality; whole-project gate green.

## Testing (§7)

Each phase's own **Tests** / **Acceptance** block above is authoritative;
this section is the cross-cutting summary of what must be green overall.

- Selector: filter, self-verify rejection, fail-closed baseline, pin
  honoured — host tests with fakes.
- Conformance: every candidate bit-identical to the reference across a
  fixed vector of sizes/alignments/edge cases (empty, 1 byte, unaligned,
  page-crossing, max).
- Benchmark harness: bounded, deterministic under a fake timer, correct
  winner, pin honoured.
- Per-arch QEMU verticals: correct family chosen on the real target;
  baseline chosen when features are masked; heterogeneous-core keying
  exercised where the emulator supports it.
- Fuzz (§19.6) each routine vs reference; crashes → corpus + unit test.
- The whole-project validation gate (§7) is green before any phase is done.

## Related capability — non-secure FIQ deliverability (scheduled; consumer: the D13 watchdog)

The lockup-watchdog work (`plans/WATCHDOG.md`, `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D13) is
**building** an aarch64 **non-maskable (FIQ) watchdog self-sample** to observe a
core wedged in a `DAIF.I`-masked section — the only tool that can name the D13
`stress --cpu N` wedge (an untracked IRQ-masked busy-spin the maskable IRQ
cadence cannot see). Whether Group 0 / FIQ is actually delivered to the
non-secure kernel is **platform/firmware-owned** — on the Raspberry Pi 4B
(BCM2711 / GIC-400) it depends on the armstub's `SCR_EL3.FIQ` routing and
`GICD_IGROUPR` group assignment, outside the non-secure kernel's control.

That "is Group 0 / FIQ deliverable to non-secure EL1?" question is a
**boot-time hardware/firmware capability**, so it belongs on *this* framework's
deterministic **capability** axis (probe/read once, never benchmarked —
invariants 1/8), with a fail-closed fallback to the existing buddy detection
when the capability is absent (never a broken channel). The split:

- **Detection is this plan's concern (P1).** The capability is reported through
  the P1 `cpufeatures` slice's honesty vocabulary
  (`FeatureSupport::Supported`/`Unsupported(reason)`/`Pending(note)`). The
  watchdog is a *consumer* that chooses the FIQ cadence vs buddy from it.
- **Mechanism stays in `kernel/arch/aarch64` (`plans/WATCHDOG.md`).** FIQ
  vectoring, Group-0 routing, the FIQ dispatcher arm, and the `DAIF.F`-clear
  execution discipline the self-sample requires are the port's concern, not
  this plan's.
- **Nuance (reconcile in P1):** unlike an ISA feature bit read from
  `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1`, FIQ-deliverability is **empirically probed** (arm Group
  0/FIQ, mask `DAIF.I`, observe whether an FIQ is taken). P1 must therefore
  accommodate a *probed platform capability* reported through the same
  `FeatureSupport` type — a distinct capability, not a `CpuFeatureSet` ISA bit.

**Dependency:** the watchdog's FIQ self-sample now depends on P1 (unbuilt) as
the charter-correct home for this capability (§2.2/§2.20 forbid an ad-hoc
one-off probe). Either P1 lands first, or a minimal P1 subset sufficient to
host a probed platform capability lands with it; the full staged watchdog plan
(B0–B4, with B0 = this P1 dependency) is in `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`.

## Explicit non-goals / guardrails

- **No crypto benchmarking, ever** (invariant 8). Crypto selection is
  availability-only and stays in the audited `lib/crypto` backends (§2.12).
- **No `cfg(target_arch)` above the HAL** (§17.2/§17.5). Detection lives
  only under `kernel/arch/<target>/`; the framework and routines are
  generic and gated on discovered bits (§2.20/§2.21).
- **No runtime code patching / ifunc** unless a specific ultra-hot path
  proves the fn-pointer indirection unaffordable, with measurement and a
  stop-and-ask (§15.7). Select-once fn-pointer tables are the default.
- **No build reproducibility regression** (§19.3): the build is
  bit-reproducible; only runtime selection varies, pinnable for
  determinism.
- **No "for now" / no-op selection** (§2.19): the baseline is a real,
  correct routine, not a stub; every phase lands complete.
