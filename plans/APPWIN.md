# APPWIN.md — Default apps go live: real channels + WM-presented windows

This is the staged build plan for the Stage 7 remainder that wires the two
default apps — the filesystem browser (`userland/apps/files`) and the
terminal emulator (`userland/apps/terminal`) — to **live** data channels and
to windows presented by the compositing desktop session. It is **binding
under `AGENTS.md`** — read `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md` Stage 7,
`plans/DISPLAY.md` (the seat/display model this builds on), and
`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` (CU6, whose picker-issued one-shot descriptors
ride this work) first; every rule in all of them applies here without
exception.

## 0. Scope and decisions (binding for this plan)

- **Apps are their own processes, never session plug-ins.** Each default
  app ships as its own self-contained `.app` bundle with its own `AppInfo`
  manifest and `Run` binary (`AGENTS.md` §16.5), spawned through the
  ordinary load gate and holding **only** its own manifest ∩ ceiling set:
  the files app requests `CAP_FS_ACCESS` (its directory reads are ordinary
  §5.3-checked VFS calls under its own identity), the terminal requests
  `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` (it spawns the user's shell over pipes). The desktop
  session's manifest stays exactly the D7 graphical class
  (`CAP_DISPLAY`/`CAP_INPUT_READ`/`CAP_SHM`) — hosting the apps in the
  session process would demand widening it with filesystem and spawn
  authority, the opposite of the CU6 sizing rule, and would make the CU6
  picker model (a one-shot descriptor handed *across* a process boundary)
  meaningless. This decision is final for this plan.
- **The window channel reuses the D7 surfaces; kernel additions are
  in-place evolutions only.** An app's window content travels zero-copy:
  the app `shm_create`s its window surface and `shm_grant`s it to the
  session (endpoint-directed, exactly the D7c client pattern), and a
  fixed-width, versioned, fuzzed `lib/abi` window protocol (the
  `display_ipc` discipline: bounded decode, fail closed, reply status
  frames) carries create/present-with-damage/close requests to a
  session-served endpoint. Input travels the other way over the same
  channel — the session routes the focused window's keyboard/pointer
  events to its owning app, and an app with no pending event **parks**
  (never polls, §2.23). The exact request/event vocabulary is fixed in
  AW2 when the engine lands, not speculated here (§2.3/§2.4).
- **The stream/pipe wait source (AW4).** `WaitSourceKind::Stream` (wire
  value 5, added in place — abi-v1 is not frozen, §2.13, in the stage that
  consumed it): `id` names a pipe read end of the caller's **own** open
  table, owner- and descriptor-checked at member add (every refusal the
  same oracle-free `NotFound`), ready — as a non-consuming, per-scan
  re-resolved peek — on buffered bytes or end-of-stream, woken by the
  pipe layer's existing write/close wakes (`STREAM_WAITQ`, joined under the
  readable-side key of each `Stream` member's own ring, so another stream's
  traffic never reaches the waiter). Conformance-tested like the D7a
  members, plus `PipeEnd::readable` / registry-peek unit tests (the peek
  borrows in place, so scanning many members neither clones an end nor
  touches a stream's live-end counts).
- **The mailbox-room wait source (AW4).** `WaitSourceKind::PortRoom` (wire
  value 10, added in place in the stage that consumed it) is the **send**
  side of the same discipline: `id` names a port the caller may post to,
  admitted by the *send*-authority check `ipc_send` applies (the caller is
  a sender, not the binder, so the `Port` kind's owner check does not
  fit), refusing the same oracle-free `NotFound`. It is ready when a send
  would not be refused for want of room — below capacity, port gone, or
  send authority lost — as a non-consuming, **level-triggered** peek: the
  member is armed *after* a send was refused, so an edge on the occupancy
  falling would already have passed if the receiver drained in between and
  the sender would park forever. The wake is targeted (a port records the
  tasks parked for its room; a committed `ipc_recv` names exactly them),
  with one broadcast on teardown, and only sets holding a `PortRoom`
  member join the queue. It is what lets a sender hold an event the
  receiver must not lose — a window resize, a picker conclusion — instead
  of dropping it or polling for capacity (the desktop's app-ward
  hold-back, `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D35).
- **Fail closed, no ambient authority** (§5.4, §4): the session accepts a
  window request only from the task the shm grant and the protocol
  identify; a refused or malformed request is a typed reply, never a
  partial window; a closed/killed app's windows are torn down by the
  session, never leaked. Every security-relevant refusal is logged with a
  stable event id (§19.4).
- **Headless stays first-class** (§17.3): everything here lives in
  `userland/gui/*`, `userland/apps/*`, and `lib/*`; no non-GUI crate
  gains a GUI edge, and a headless image simply ships no desktop session.
- **Not in this plan:** the input-device→seat topology policy
  (`plans/PI.md` P11 / the seat manager), and the GUI widget vocabulary
  (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`).

## 1. Stages

### AW1 — the live directory channel plumbing `[x]`

The shape-neutral data plumbing both the files app's future `Run` binary
and today's `ls` share, landed with today's consumers so nothing is
speculative:

- `tairix_abi::fs::DirEntries` — the **one** whole-stream walker over the
  `fs_readdir` byte stream: a fused iterator yielding each decoded
  `DirEntry` and surfacing the first decode error as a terminal
  `Err` (the caller refuses the whole listing, never a partial one).
  Unit-tested beside the codec; the `fuzz_decode` harness walks arbitrary
  streams (termination, fail-closed refusal, no panic).
- `lib/rt` grows the shared directory-read call: `read_all_growing`
  (the pure retry policy — grow a buffer on `BufferTooSmall`, doubling to
  a hard ceiling, host-tested with closures) and `read_dir_all(path)`
  (open-as-directory + grow loop against the kernel's `FS_IO_MAX`
  transfer cap). `ls`'s private copy of that loop is deleted and its
  `read_dir` re-built on the shared pair — one definition (§2.2).
- `userland/apps/files::vfs` — the production `DirectorySource` engine:
  `absolute_path` (root-first components → a bounded, validated absolute
  path; refuses an empty/`/`-bearing/NUL-bearing component or a path over
  `FS_PATH_MAX` before any syscall), `entries_from_dir_stream` (the
  `DirEntries` walk mapped onto the browser's `Entry` vocabulary, whole
  listing refused on any bad record), and `VfsDirectorySource<F>` — the
  composition over an injected `fetch(path) -> stream` primitive, so the
  engine is host-proven end to end (a `Browser` navigating an in-memory
  tree of *encoded* `DirEntry` streams). The freestanding fetcher is one
  line (`tairix_rt::read_dir_all`) and lands wired inside the files `Run`
  binary in AW3, exactly as staged consumers landed for the encrypted-swap
  layer and the SP11 stack spans.

### AW2 — the window protocol + engine `[x]`

- `tairix_abi::window_ipc` — the fixed-width, versioned, fail-closed
  vocabulary: `WindowRequest` (`Create` with the granted shm surface, the
  app's event endpoint — reserved endpoints refused — geometry, and a
  bounded control-character-free `WindowTitle`; `Present` by frame index
  + non-empty damage; `Close`), the 12-byte create reply carrying the
  session-minted non-zero window id, and the app-ward `WindowEvent`s
  (`Focus`, `Key` embedding the one `KeyInput` codec, window-local
  `Pointer`, `CloseRequested`, `RedrawRequested`). `WINDOW_ENDPOINT`
  (`0x5749_1001`) joined `is_reserved_endpoint`; the decoders are
  enrolled in `fuzz_decode`.
- **The icon-bar declaration** (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T7) is the one
  *caller-scoped* request on this channel: `WindowRequest::SetAppBar(AppBar)`
  names no window, because an application's presence on the desktop's icon
  bar belongs to the process rather than to any one of its windows. It
  carries the event route, whether the application handles its slot's primary
  click, and a bounded `AppMenu` (≤ 32 rows a plate, ≤ 64 in all, ≤ 4 plates
  deep, ≤ 36 label bytes, a session-rendered `Info` row), and it is
  idempotent-replace. Its
  two answers — `WindowEvent::AppBarDefault` and `AppBarMenu { item }` — are
  likewise **application-scoped**, which is why `WindowEvent::window_id()`
  returns `Option<u64>` and why `WindowServer` has two delivery paths that
  each refuse the other's events: `deliver_app_event` addresses a bar event
  through the route the *declaration* recorded, never anything the event
  carries. `WindowHost::app_bar_declared` defaults to **refuse**
  (`Errno::NotSupported`), so a host that composes no icon bar fails closed.
- `lib/window` — both halves over injected seams (the `lib/display`
  precedent): `WindowServer` (decode → `CallerIdentity` attestation
  (`call_peer_origin`) → owner/bounds validation → the `WindowHost`
  compositor bridge; windows keyed to the owner's `ProcId`, `NotFound`
  for any window the caller does not own — `SetTitle` included, so an app
  can retitle only its own window and the attested `ProcId` reaches
  `window_opened` as the sole source of a window's identity icon —
  map-once regions via the
  shared `tairix_display::ShmMapper`, per-client frame-byte budget,
  `client_exited` teardown, `deliver_event` app-ward routing validated
  against the live window) and `WindowClient`/`WindowEvents` (typed
  calls over `WindowTransport`; a read — never a poll — over the mailbox
  seam, `EventDrain` for the drain and `EventSource` where the source also
  parks). Host-proven against an in-process loopback; no kernel change.
- **The redraw handshake.** The session may release a window's retained
  content to reclaim memory (`docs/src/desktop/wm.md`, "Releasable window
  content"), which costs the app nothing but leaves the window blank
  until a *full-window* present arrives — a present carries only a damage
  rectangle, so a re-established surface starts transparent.
  `RedrawRequested` is that ask. `lib/window` answers it for the app:
  `WindowClient` records each window's last presented frame index and
  current extent and `WindowEvents::wait` re-presents that frame with
  full-window damage before returning the event, so an app inherits the
  handshake by using the client library and an app that wants genuinely
  fresh pixels still sees the event. A window that has never presented
  has nothing to re-send. An app that decodes its mailbox directly rather
  than through `WindowEvents` gets no auto-answer and repaints itself
  (the terminal and the Switchboard panel do); an app that ignores the
  event simply shows a blank window until it next presents.

### AW3 — session window server + the files app goes live `[x]`

Done. What now holds:

- The desktop session binds `WINDOW_ENDPOINT` authorised by its live,
  kernel-attested seat lease (no privileged-bind capability, no ceiling
  widening) and serves it from its wait-set loop via the `ShellWindowHost`
  bridge into `DesktopShell` (`userland/gui/session/src/windows.rs` +
  `run.rs`): served windows are composited, taskbar-tasked, and focused
  like native windows; app-ward `Focus`/`Pointer`/`Key` events flow over
  the AW2 `EventSink` (`ipc_send`), and a kernel-reclaimed event port
  (dead app) tears the owner's windows down. The loop dispatches on the
  woken member's token — `call_recv` blocks when nothing is pending, so a
  seat wake never touches the window endpoint (the wedge the first
  end-to-end run exposed); readiness is a non-consuming peek, so pending
  members re-report on the next wait.
- **A served window is shown when its client first presents into it.** Its
  pixels are the application's, so between the create and the first present
  the session has nothing of the application's to put on screen: the window
  opens **off screen and holding no pixels**
  (`Compositor::add_unpresented_window` / `DesktopShell::open_unpresented_window`),
  and `window_presented` maps it (`DesktopShell::map_window` — show, raise,
  focus) on the never-presented → painted transition, before the frame is
  composed, so the `WINDOW_SHOWN` witness still follows pixels the display
  took. The taskbar entry is added at open, so an application that is slow to
  render is listed and reachable while it gets ready. `WindowRecord`'s
  `FirstFrame::Unpresented` is distinct from `Awaited` for exactly this
  reason: `Awaited` is an *already-mapped* window whose pixels memory pressure
  took back, and a present must never un-minimise a window the user put away.
  There is no opening fill for a top-level window; a popup keeps one, because
  it is placed on its parent and shown at once by the user's own gesture.
- A served window is declared **app-presented** to the compositor when it
  opens, which is what makes its content pixels releasable under memory
  pressure; the windows the session paints itself (bar, lock screen,
  picker, confirmation prompt) never are, because no client would answer
  their redraw. The memory-pressure member of the same wait set drives
  the release: the woken branch trims the desktop's caches, runs the
  content ladder, then drains `Compositor::pending_redraws` and delivers
  `RedrawRequested` to each released window's owner through the existing
  served-window id mapping — the same route every other app-ward event
  takes, with no second table. The drain also runs after a window becomes
  visible again, so a restored window that lost its pixels is asked for
  them at once.
- `userland/apps/files` ships its `Run` binary + signed `AppInfo`
  (`CAP_FS_ACCESS` only) inside the bundle: `VfsDirectorySource` over
  `tairix_rt::read_dir_all`, rendering through the shared theme, window
  create/present over the AW2 client, parked event wait, redraw on
  focus/theme-relevant events, clean exit on `CloseRequested`. The
  file manager is an autostarted core desktop component (spawning at
  bring-up via `spawn_files`); its first window is opened by the session
  at desktop reveal
  (`tairix_desktop_session::config` — the one production configuration
  the QEMU harness also imports for its click coordinates).
- The autoload QEMU vertical drives the full click-through with injected
  pointer buttons (`tools/qemu` ordered `PointerStep` script + ordered
  marker-gated screendumps): the reveal → served-window clicks →
  the Library popup's terminal launch (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5), with
  two host-verified screendumps (the desktop;
  the served window at the cascade origin). All
  gates are kernel-attested serial records (the window endpoint's first
  `CallReplied`, `MessageDelivered` counts per the interaction contract in
  the test crate's lib target); the guest PASS rides the AW4 tail below,
  so the run cannot pass without the whole chain. Uncovered and fixed
  along the way: the session's blocking-recv
  loop wedge (above) and the virtio-input event queue's 8-descriptor
  ceiling silently dropping bursts under a saturated CPU (now the
  device's full 64, `lib/virtio_input`).
- Every coordinate the vertical uses is the desktop's own: a served
  window's footprint is the shared cascade origin — its **outer**
  top-left — with the app's client surface grown by the furniture band
  the window manager reserves (`WindowFrame::insets`, the same frame the
  compositor decorates with), and each app declares its own sizing once
  (`WIN_SIZING`, beside its window size; the terminal, whose floor is a
  runtime font measurement, derives `WIN_RESIZABLE` from that one
  declaration) because resizability sizes the band.
  `served_window_layout` returns both rectangles, so a
  screendump assertion measures the whole window while a click is
  measured inside the *client* and therefore reaches the application
  rather than the title bar above it.

### AW4 — the terminal goes live `[x]`

Done. What now holds:

- `WaitSourceKind::Stream` (see §0): the kernel wait-set wakes a parked
  owner on its own pipe read end's buffered bytes or end-of-stream.
- `tairix_terminal::spawned` — the production `ShellSource`, host-tested
  over injected closures: `shell_wires` (the one attach-block layout —
  child stdin from the keystroke pipe, stdout *and* stderr onto the one
  output pipe, fd 3 closed; canonical under `SpawnAttach::parse`) and
  `PipeShellSource` (one bounded chunk per wake, end-of-stream surfaced
  as the typed "shell exited" refusal, short-write resume, wedged-channel
  fail-closed). The `Run` binary supplies `pipe_create` ×2,
  `spawn_attached` of `tairix_users::policy::DEFAULT_SHELL` (with `TERM`
  exported and the child-side ends closed after the spawn), and
  `fs_read`/`fs_write` under the seam.
- `userland/apps/terminal` ships its `Run` bundle (signed `AppInfo`:
  `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` + `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` + `CAP_SHM`, 13-locale `Help/`):
  the 80×24 grid presented over the AW2 client, parked on one wait-set
  (window-event `Port`, shell-output `Stream`, shell `Child`), token
  dispatch, `lib/keymap`-encoded key presses, pump-and-present on shell
  output, clean teardown on end-of-stream / child exit / close. The
  program-library popup's terminal entry spawns it
  (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5); the app event-mailbox
  naming rule is `tairix_abi::window_ipc::event_endpoint_for` (one
  definition, beside the other pid-derived endpoints, which the
  allocator-free verticals read too), and the cascade placement is
  `tairix_desktop_session::windows::cascade_origin_for` (shared with the
  vertical's click script).
- The autoload QEMU vertical drives the AW4 tail after the AW3
  click-through: the Library button → the popup's terminal entry
  (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5), the terminal-window click gated on the
  third window-frame map (the terminal's create — map counts track
  window creation, never repaints), `true` + Enter typed at the seat
  keyboard gated on the
  click's deliveries, and guest PASS latching a kernel `ProcessSpawned`
  record observed at/after the Enter press's delivery count — the only
  spawn possible then is the shell executing the typed command, so PASS
  proves the whole keyboard → session → terminal → pipe → shell → spawn
  round trip (the interaction contract lives in the test crate's lib
  target).

### AW5 — CU6 picker-issued one-shot descriptors `[x]`

Done (code + host coverage). What now holds:

- **Kernel one-shot delegation** (`fd_grant` 90 / `fd_redeem` 91,
  in-place `abi-v1` additions): `fd_grant(fd, write_ceiling, recipient,
  len)` delegates the caller's **own** plain, non-directory filesystem
  descriptor — with that descriptor's own access, a writable one bounded by
  a mandatory extent ceiling — to the process *instance* `recipient` names — the
  attested `ProcId` the grantor read from an `Origin`, never a task id,
  which is redrawn once its task is gone. The instance is recorded with
  the delegation and `fd_redeem` admits it alone, so a pick that concludes
  after the requesting app exited cannot land on a later holder of its
  number. The grantor's uid + effective capability set are captured beside
  the path; the recipient-bound handle travels in-band and
  `fd_redeem` consumes it **once** (atomically — only after the
  descriptor allocation succeeds) into an
  `OpenBacking::Delegated` entry. Delegated reads (`fs_read` and the
  wired stream arm) are re-authorised through the secured VFS under the
  **grantor's** captured identity on every call; a read-only delegation
  refuses every write, and one handed on keeps the first grantor's
  authority and at most its ceiling (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6), so no
  chain forms and nothing widens. The grant is dispatcher-audited with
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, redemption is unprivileged and audited, and an
  exited recipient's pending delegations are reclaimed. `lib/rt`
  wrappers, `lib/abi-sys` `tairix_sys_*` stubs, and the regenerated C
  header carry the surface.
- **Protocol**: `WindowRequest::PickFile { window_id, purpose }` (op 4,
  status reply = acceptance only; the purpose is `Open` or
  `Save { suggested, endings }`, the endings what the requester can write)
  and the conclusions
  `WindowEvent::FilePicked { window_id, handle, writable }` (kind 5,
  non-zero handle, `writable` a 0/1 byte) / `WindowEvent::PickCancelled`
  (kind 6), with the chosen name
  pulled once by `WindowRequest::TakePickedName` (op 6). The `lib/window`
  engine keys the pick to the attested owner, enforces one pending pick
  per window (`AlreadyExists`), forwards acceptance through the
  `WindowHost::pick_requested` bridge (a refusal records nothing), and
  concludes only through `conclude_pick`, which requires-and-clears the
  pending pick and holds the name, so exactly one conclusion follows each
  acceptance; the client half is `WindowClient::pick_file` and
  `take_picked_name`.
- **The shared browser engine moved to `lib/browse`** (`tairix-browse`):
  the AW1 model/renderer/path-spelling hoisted out of the files app (its
  package is now the `Run` binary only) because the picker is its second
  consumer, plus the renderer-mirroring row hit-test
  (`render::entry_index_at`/`row_height`) the picker's clicks resolve
  through.
- **The chooser is a dialog.** It wears the window manager's frame
  (`DesktopShell::decorate_window`, fixed-size because the shared browser view
  renders at one geometry), so the user sees whose window it is, moves it by
  its title bar, and closes it. `window_control_event` therefore has two
  halves: the window-manager-local one (minimise, put-to-back, size toggle) is
  performed for *any* decorated window, and the app-ward event is produced only
  for a served one. Close on a session-owned window performs nothing there —
  what dismissal means is the owner's — and the serve loop routes the picker's
  to `SessionPicker::cancel`, which is the same conclusion Escape reaches. A
  host-side observer reconstructing a row's screen position adds the frame's
  own client inset (`WindowFrame::insets`) to `PICKER_ORIGIN`, which is the
  outer top-left.
- **The session's trusted picker** (`tairix_desktop_session::picker`):
  `SessionPicker` — one picker slot at a time, a fresh root listing under
  the session's own authority per pick (a refused listing refuses the
  pick), a session-owned window at the deterministic `PICKER_ORIGIN`,
  key (`Down`/`Up`/`Enter`/`Backspace`/`Escape`) and click (shared
  hit-test) navigation, conclusions delivered by the `Run` binary's
  file worker and privileged tail (the open — read-write for an owner whose
  attested bundle edits documents, where the user may write — → `fd_grant`
  to the owner's attested instance, which is what the compositor records as
  a window's owner → `fs_close` → `FilePicked`, any refusal honestly
  `PickCancelled`), and
  a requesting window's death aborts its pick via the
  `ShellWindowHost` bridge. The session's manifest gained
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS` (AppInfo + kernel pin) — the CU6 trusted-UI widening.
- **The consumer**: `userland/apps/view` (`view.app`, a program-library
  entry), manifest `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` + `CAP_SHM` + `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` and
  deliberately **no filesystem capability** — it window-creates, asks
  `pick_file` when it was handed no document, redeems the delegated handle,
  reads the document under a fixed input-byte ceiling, and streams it to its
  own capability-empty decoder (`plans/VIEW.md`); cancellation shows a notice.
  The read-only *text* viewer that first proved this path is deleted: its
  design was a text pager, and the property AW5 turns on — an application
  holding no filesystem authority reading exactly the one file the user chose
  — is what `view.app` now carries.
- Coverage: kernel grant/redeem/delegated-read/withdraw unit tests, the
  window-protocol round-trip/fail-closed tests (decoders remain in
  `fuzz_decode`), the `lib/window` loopback pick suite, the `lib/browse`
  hit-test tests, the session picker suite, and the viewer engine tests.
- **Guest coverage: two verticals, one per route.** Both are dedicated
  siblings rather than stages bolted onto the autoload script, whose every
  delivery count, reply index, and cascade slot would shift under them (and
  which is the D15 freeze case, so a security path's only guest coverage must
  not live on it). `filepick_qemu_aarch64` drives the **picker** route —
  library → `view`'s row → its bar slot → the planted document's row, gated on
  the session's own `PICKER_SHOWN`, passing on `desktop fd_grant` then `view
  fd_redeem`. `handover_qemu_aarch64` drives the **three-principal** route the
  file manager uses (`plans/VIEW.md`): activating a planted picture in a
  file-manager window through the item's own context-menu *Open* row, passing
  on two complete relays of `files fd_grant` → `desktop fd_redeem` →
  `desktop fd_grant` → `view fd_redeem`, the viewer's two redeems required to
  come from the same kernel-attested task, and each latched step printing its
  own marker so a failing run names the missing hop. A host-side observer
  reconstructs a gesture into a *cascade-placed* window through
  `reconstruct_manager_item_click`, which is the shared counterpart of the
  fixed-origin `PICKER_ORIGIN` arithmetic above.

### AW6 — app-owned popup surfaces `[x]`

Done. What now holds:

- **Protocol**: `WindowRequest::CreatePopup { parent_window_id,
  shm_handle, event_endpoint, frame_count, width_px, height_px,
  stride_bytes, format, offset_x, offset_y }` (op 11) — an undecorated,
  parent-anchored surface any app opens for an overlay its own window
  would otherwise clip. Its own variant, not extra `Create` fields,
  because a popup carries no title (never a taskbar entry) and no
  `resizable` flag. The frame-layout block is shared verbatim with
  `Create`/`Resize`, so one definition validates the geometry of all
  three. The reply is the `Create` reply shape (minted id + the serving
  session's `ProcId`).
- **Placement is parent-relative; the session resolves and clamps it.**
  An app is never told its own window's screen position, so the offsets
  are physical pixels from the **parent's client origin** and any signed
  value is legitimate. `ShellWindowHost::popup_opened` adds them to the
  parent's live client origin and clamps the whole popup on screen with
  the shared `tairix_geometry::Rect::clamped_onto`, which the one plate
  placement rule (`tairix_controls::plate_rect`) also ends with, so there is one
  placement clamp.
- **Engine rules** (`lib/window`): no kernel caller; the parent must be a
  live window the attested caller owns (foreign *and* unknown parents both
  answer `NotFound`); the geometry is validated exactly as `Create`; the
  popup's frames are charged against the same per-client byte budget; the host
  is told before anything is committed, so a refusal leaves no record, no
  id consumed, and the mapping dropped. One shared `PopupSpec` describes
  the request on both halves (`WindowClient::create_popup`).
- **Undecorated by construction**: the session opens it through
  `DesktopShell::open_popup_window` (compositor `add_transient_window` +
  focus), which never decorates and never opens a taskbar entry — the path
  the trusted picker already used. No protocol "undecorated" bit exists.
- **Stacking is the compositor's, held by the restack itself**: a popup is
  its parent's *transient* (`Compositor::add_transient_window`), stacked
  directly above its owner, and `raise`/`lower` move the family as a unit
  whichever member is named — so nothing can land between them and nothing
  re-asserts the arrangement per frame. The per-wake re-assert this plan
  originally specified was a defect: it dropped the parent's retained
  frosted backdrop every frame, costing a translucent blurred terminal a
  full-window blur per pointer sample its open menu saw
  (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md` D.10). The session still records the link
  on its `WindowRecord`, but only to choose a close's teardown.
- **Lifetime**: closing the parent (channel close, frame control, or
  `client_exited`) tears down every popup keyed to it; closing a popup's
  own id tears down only the popup. The session clears the link on both
  paths.
- **Consumer**: the terminal's settings sheet is a popup, sized from the
  sheet's own preferred extent rather than the window's, with popup-local
  event coordinates demultiplexed on
  `WindowEvent::window_id` (`plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md` §9) — which, since the
  terminal became one process with many windows, is also how a delivery is
  attributed to the *window* it belongs to.
- Coverage: `lib/abi` round-trip + fail-closed decode tests (reserved
  tail, zero ids, reserved endpoint, signed/negative offsets),
  `lib/window` loopback popup suite (round trip, present/close on the
  popup id, foreign/unknown parent, the shared cap, kernel refusal, a
  refused host committing nothing, parent-close cascade, dead-client
  teardown), the session suite (undecorated + off-taskbar placement at the
  parent's client origin, screen clamp, unknown parent, popup close
  leaving the parent's task, the pair staying glued through an intruder
  raise, and a popup hover repainting only the popup), the compositor's own
  transient suite, and `lib/geometry`'s `clamped_onto` tests.

## 2. Documentation

`docs/src/desktop/apps.md` carries the app-side design as each stage
lands; the window protocol joins `docs/src/desktop/wm.md` (AW2/AW3); the
ABI additions keep `docs/src/architecture/syscalls.md` and the generated C
headers current in the same change (§9, §13).
