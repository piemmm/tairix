# DEVICES.md — Device inventory commands and USB mass storage

This is the staged build plan for TAIRiX's next tier of device support:

- **DEVICE1** — `lspci` and `lsusb` system command apps that list the
  discovered PCI/PCIe and USB devices with human-readable vendor/device
  names resolved from vetted, locally cached snapshots of the public PCI
  and USB ID databases.
- **DEVICE2** — a USB mass-storage class driver and the hotplug automount
  path: a plugged-in USB disk's filesystems appear under the `Storage:`
  catalog with deterministic, collision-free names and sane permissions;
  surprise removal is handled with retained uncommitted data, a syslog
  record, and an explicit force-unmount / verified re-insert recovery
  choice.
- **DEVICE3 (D5)** — the further mass-storage wire transports on the same
  seams: USB Attached SCSI (UAS), Control/Bulk/Interrupt (CBI), and USB
  floppy drives (the UFI command set over BOT and CBI).

`AGENTS.md` is binding — read it and `PLAN.md` first. Every rule in this
file is binding too. Related plans: `plans/USB.md` (the modular USB stack
this builds on), `docs/src/filesystem/drives.md` + `plans/DRIVES.md` /
`plans/ALIAS.md` (the storage namespace the automount publishes into),
`plans/APPS.md` (command-app packaging), `plans/SYSLOG.md` (event
logging), `plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` (capability lifecycle).

---

## 0. Starting point (what already exists)

Facts the stages below build on, so no stage re-derives them:

- **The hardware tree is the single device inventory (§18.1).** Every
  discovered PCI function and USB interface is a `HwNode` whose
  `HwMatchKey`s already carry the numeric identities the listing commands
  need: PCI `vendor:device:class` and USB `vid:pid:class` triples
  (`lib/abi/src/hwtree.rs`). The tree is exposed read-only through the
  `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`-gated `hw_tree_read`/`hw_tree_wait` syscalls and
  through `sysinfod`'s `HARDWARE_TREE` query, which the existing
  `sysinfo hardware` command already renders. No new kernel surface is
  needed to *list* devices — only to name them.
- **The modular USB stack is complete** (`plans/USB.md` U1–U5): bus
  driver → user-space xHCI HCD owning one controller → per-interface
  nodes → class drivers over the URB transport IPC
  (`lib/abi/src/usb_urb.rs`), with event-driven hotplug in both
  directions and the kernel driver-unload mechanism. The URB transport
  serves control-IN, the no-data control-OUT (since D2 — a SETUP-only
  class request), the control-OUT *data stage* (since D5 — the CBI ADSC
  command channel), interrupt, and — since D1 (§2.2) — bulk transfers on
  every configured bulk endpoint (up to the two pairs a UAS interface's
  four pipes need, since D5).
  **The engine and HCD serve every reachable device concurrently**
  (`UsbDevice::bring_up` walks every connected hub port into a growable
  table bounded only by the controller's reported slot count, each device
  with its own demand-allocated DMA region and its own lazily created HCD
  transport — endpoint, shared buffer, interface node): a
  keyboard and a storage stick plugged in together are both served,
  fixing the Pi 4 boot defect where a plugged-in stick won the engine's
  single device slot and the keyboard never enumerated. Hot-plug
  attaches/detaches exactly the affected device's index; a failed
  per-port enumeration is skipped with its slot released
  (`plans/USB.md` §1.1).
- **The block-driver contract exists**
  (`tairix_abi::driver::block::Block`), implemented by
  `drivers/storage/virtio_blk` and `drivers/storage/emmc2` with bounded,
  fixed-cost DMA staging. Filesystem crates exist for ext4, FAT32, and
  ARXFS; `lib/partition` is the shared MBR/GPT layer.
- **The storage namespace is specified and partially landed.** The
  binding spec (`docs/src/filesystem/drives.md`) defines the forest of
  named roots: canonical `id::<volume-id>` identity, aliases, the
  `Storage:` catalog as a synthetic view of published non-core roots, and
  the hotplug lifecycle (tree update → driver stack attach → `id::` root
  → alias policy → catalog → sysinfo visibility). The four machine
  aliases and the `fs_*` descriptor ABI are landed; the durable
  `id::`/`fs::` resolver roots and the volume forest are still open
  (PLAN.md P4) and are a prerequisite DEVICE2 completes, not assumes.
- **Command-app conventions are fixed** (`plans/APPS.md`, §16.5/§16.7):
  a command is a full self-contained bundle in the system command store with
  its `Help/` tree, follows the established GNU/`pciutils`/`usbutils`
  option and output surface, emits additive `stdinfo` records, and
  acquires authority only through its manifest capability request.
- **Asset-generation precedent**: `cargo xtask font-atlas` generates
  checked-in Rust data from a committed, licence-vetted asset in
  `lib/font/assets/` and verifies drift in CI. The ID-database pipeline
  follows the same shape.

---

## 1. Stage DEVICE1 — `lspci` and `lsusb`

### 1.1 The ID databases: import, vetting, and cache

The public databases are:

- PCI: `https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/v2.2/pci.ids` (~1.6 MiB plain text,
  versioned and dated in its header, explicitly dual-licensed
  GPL-2.0-or-later / BSD-3-Clause — both already on the `deny.toml`
  allow-list).
- USB: `http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids` (~0.7 MiB, same tab-indented
  line grammar, distributed with `usbutils` under GPL-2.0-or-later; no
  in-file licence header, so the import records the upstream licence
  statement in the snapshot provenance header and the refresh stops for
  human review if upstream terms change, §15.7). Upstream publishes **no
  valid TLS endpoint** for this file (`linux-usb.org`, `www.linux-usb.org`,
  and the maintainer mirror all serve broken certificates), so the fetch
  uses the canonical HTTP URL and integrity rests on the recorded SHA-256
  plus the human review of the snapshot diff — CI and builds never fetch.

Both share one grammar: `vendor_id  name` lines, single-tab
`device_id  name` children, two-tab subsystem children (pci.ids only), plus
trailing tagged class/other tables (`C`, and for usb.ids `AT`, `HID`, `R`,
`BIAS`, `PHY`, `HUT`, `L`, `HCC`, `VT` — a closed set; an unknown tag stops
the import for review). One parser handles both (§2.2).

**Pipeline (the `cargo xtask devids` subcommand):**

1. `cargo xtask devids --fetch` — developer-run only, never CI or the
   build (§19.3 forbids build/post-install network fetches; builds stay
   offline and reproducible). It downloads both files over HTTPS where
   offered (pci.ids; usb.ids has no valid TLS endpoint, see above),
   runs the vetting filter (below), and rewrites the committed snapshots
   under `lib/devids/assets/` with a provenance header: upstream URL,
   upstream version/date lines, fetch date, SHA-256 of the raw download,
   and the licence statement. The refresh diff is human-reviewed like any
   other change (§2.6); CI never sees the network.
2. `cargo xtask devids --write` — regenerates the compact lookup tables
   (see §1.2) from the committed snapshots.
3. `cargo xtask devids` (no flag, part of `cargo xtask ci`) — re-runs the
   converter over the committed snapshots and fails closed on any drift
   between snapshot and generated tables, exactly like `c-header` and
   `font-atlas`.

**Vetting filter (the "checked for malicious content" gate).** The raw
download is untrusted input (§19.5) and its strings end up on users'
terminals, so the filter is strict, fail-closed, and bounded (§24.4):

- The file must parse under the exact line grammar above; any line that
  is not a comment, a blank, or a well-formed entry rejects the whole
  import (never skip-and-continue on structure, so a smuggled section
  cannot hide).
- Every name must be valid UTF-8 and contain **no control bytes** other
  than the structural tab/newline — no ESC/CSI/C0/C1, so a hostile entry
  cannot inject terminal escape sequences through `lspci` output. Names
  are length-bounded; ids must be exact-width lowercase hex; duplicate
  ids within a scope are rejected.
- Entry counts and total size are bounded (fixed security bounds sized
  with generous headroom over today's ~40k entries).
- The fetch verifies the transport (TLS for pci.ids) and records the
  SHA-256 so the reviewed snapshot is pinned; a later `--write`/CI run
  operates only on the pinned, reviewed bytes (§19.3 spirit).

The vetting logic lives in `lib/devids` (host-testable, shared by the
xtask generator — one definition, §2.2) and carries a fuzz harness over
the raw-text parser (§19.6): it consumes genuinely untrusted bytes.

### 1.2 `lib/devids` — the lookup engine

A new `lib/*` crate (`tairix-devids`, `no_std`+`alloc`-free lookup;
adding it updates `AGENTS.md` §3 and `PLAN.md` in the same change, §6):

- **Compact table format.** The generator emits, per database, a sorted
  binary table (vendor records → device records → subsystem/interface
  records, plus the class tables) with an index the lookup binary-searches
  — O(log n), no allocation, no whole-file scan (§2.16). The format is
  self-identifying (magic, version, counts, bounds) and the runtime
  decoder validates every offset/length fail-closed (§5.4) — the file
  ships on the read-only system volume but is still parsed as data, never
  trusted blindly.
- **API.** `pci_vendor(u16) -> Option<&str>`,
  `pci_device(u16, u16) -> Option<&str>`,
  `pci_class(u32) -> Option<(&str, &str, Option<&str>)>` (class /
  subclass / prog-if), and the `usb_*` equivalents (vendor, product,
  class triple, plus the usb.ids auxiliary tables only if a consumer
  renders them — no speculative surface, §2.3). An unknown id is `None`;
  the caller renders the numeric form (fail closed, never fabricate).
- **Data placement.** Each command bundle carries its own database file
  as a bundle resource (§16.5 self-containment): `lspci.app/Resources/
  pci.ids.bin` and `lsusb.app/Resources/usb.ids.bin`, laid onto the
  image from the generated tables by the image builder through the same
  discovered-from-disk path as `Help/` trees — never `include_bytes!`
  into a binary (help/data-on-volume rule, §16.5) and never a second
  copy of the tables in the tree. `lib/devids` is the one source of the
  encode + decode + lookup; the two `.bin` files are generated artefacts.

### 1.3 The `lspci` command app (`userland/apps/lspci`)

- **Data source:** the `sysinfod` `HARDWARE_TREE` query through the
  existing `lib/procinfo` client seam — never a kernel bypass, never a
  `/proc` fabrication (§16.6). The manifest requests `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`;
  a refusal defeats the command's whole purpose, so it exits with the
  reason on stderr (§2.24), never a fabricated empty list.
- **Selection:** nodes whose match keys are `HwMatchKind::Pci`, rendered
  in stable bus order (parent-chain order from the tree).
- **Output follows `pciutils` (§16.7 principle):** default one line per
  function — address, class name, vendor + device name (numeric id when
  the database has no entry, matching `lspci`'s `Device <id>` form) —
  with the established options implemented over what the model carries:
  `-n` (numeric), `-nn` (names + ids), `-d <vendor>:<device>` and
  `-s <slot>` filters, `-v` (the node's resources: MMIO windows, IRQ
  lines — the grant *requests* the tree records, no secrets), `-t` (tree
  view). Where TAIRiX's model genuinely lacks a field Linux has the
  option is withheld or degrades honestly rather than fabricating:
  subsystem ids are not recorded by the hardware tree today (extending
  `hwtree` is a deliberate carve-out for a later ABI revision, not
  smuggled in here, §18.1), and `-k` (bound driver bundle) is not
  offered until the system publishes driver-binding records through the
  store/sysinfo path — a clear unknown-option error beats a flag that
  cannot be served honestly.
- **`stdinfo`:** additive records only (§20.1) — e.g. an `omission`
  record when unnamed devices were rendered numerically, with the
  unnamed count and whether the database loaded in `ai` context (the
  compiled table deliberately carries no upstream version string).
- Full `Help/` tree (en-US canonical), rustdoc, and a
  `docs/src/userland/` page in the same change (§13, §16.5).

### 1.4 The `lsusb` command app (`userland/apps/lsusb`)

- Same data source, capability posture, and bundle shape as `lspci`.
- **Selection:** nodes with `HwMatchKind::Usb` keys (the per-interface
  nodes the HCD emits), grouped into physical devices by the bus-local
  device address each node carries (`HwNode::address`, the device's
  bus position the HCD reports — `0` = unreported, never grouped), plus
  their parent controller nodes for the `-t` topology view.
- **Output follows `usbutils`:** default `Bus NNN Device NNN: ID
  vvvv:pppp Vendor Product` lines — **one line per physical device**,
  never per interface — with bus and device numbers rendered as 1-based
  per-snapshot ordinals in stable bus order (a deliberate, documented
  divergence: TAIRiX has no Linux devnum registry, so the numbers are
  small dense orderings of the snapshot, §16.7 divergence-by-concept),
  `-v` (each interface's class/subclass/protocol names from the usb.ids
  class table, one triple per interface), `-s`/`-d` filters on the
  rendered numbers and ids, `-t` (bus → device → interface tree, the
  bus line naming the controller by its `compatible` identity).
- Same `stdinfo`, `Help/`, and docs obligations as `lspci`.

### 1.5 DEVICE1 increments

Each increment ends green on the whole-project gate (§7).

- **V1 — `lib/devids` + `cargo xtask devids`. Done.** `lib/devids` holds
  the shared parser + vetting filter + compact-table encoder and the
  alloc-free binary-search decoder (`DevIds`: `vendor`/`device`/`class`/
  `subclass`/`prog_if`); the xtask subcommand (`--fetch` / `--write` /
  verify) imports with full provenance headers and drift-checks as a
  `cargo xtask ci` static gate; the vetted snapshots live in
  `lib/devids/assets/`, each generated table in its consuming bundle's
  `Resources/`; the `fuzz_devids` harness covers both untrusted surfaces.
  Reality-driven decisions: usb.ids is fetched over upstream's canonical
  HTTP URL (no valid TLS offered) with SHA-256 + review as integrity; a
  stray ISO-8859-1 byte in usb.ids is deterministically promoted to
  UTF-8 and recorded in the provenance header; auxiliary-section ids
  accept 1–4 hex digits of either case (upstream publishes uppercase HUT
  usages) while every emitted scope stays exact-width lowercase; PCI
  subsystem entries and the auxiliary tables are validated but not
  encoded (no consumer renders them). §3/PLAN.md carry the crate and
  subcommand.
- **V2 — `lspci`. Done.** `userland/apps/lspci`: the pure engine
  (fail-closed `HwNode` decode, stable parent-chain bus order, the
  `-n`/`-nn`/`-v`/`-t`/`-d`/`-s` surface, numeric fallbacks, the
  `pci.names_unresolved` fd-3 advisory) over the shared
  `tairix_procinfo::call`/`Output`/`HelpSource` seams; the freestanding
  `Run` loads `Resources/pci.ids.bin` through the VFS and degrades to
  numeric ids (reason on stderr) on a missing/invalid table, and treats a
  refused `CAP_SYSINFO_HW` as fatal with its reason. Thirteen-locale
  `Help/` with the switch-pinning test; host unit tests run over a canned
  tree + a fixture database compiled through the real `lib/devids`
  pipeline. Reality-driven decisions: a function's address is its stable
  hardware-tree node id (`#<node>`, the lsusb-style documented
  divergence — the tree records no BDF); `-k` is withheld (no
  driver-binding records exist to serve it honestly, §1.3); the compiled
  pci table moved into the bundle (`userland/apps/lspci/Resources/`, one
  tree copy, `cargo xtask devids` retargeted). Enabling
  infrastructure landed with it: generic bundle-`Resources/` discovery
  (`tairix_syshelp::RESOURCE_FILES` — build-discovered from each crate's
  on-disk `Resources/`, never a per-bundle list) feeding the signed
  `AppInfo` content digest and both planters (`tools/mkimage`, the QEMU
  encrypted-root fixture); the kernel load gate already re-hashes the
  whole bundle, so a tampered resource refuses the spawn. QEMU coverage:
  the SP10b pipeline vertical spawns `lspci --help` from the planted
  store, proving the resource-carrying bundle through the content-hash
  gate end to end; the emulated aarch64 `virt` image drives virtio-mmio
  devices and publishes no PCI-function nodes yet, so the full listing is
  host-proven and a live-listing vertical rides the first emulated
  PCI-function target that carries the system command store.
- **V3 — `lsusb`. Done.** `userland/apps/lsusb`, as V2 for the USB view:
  the pure engine (interface selection over `HwMatchKind::Usb` keys, the
  `usbutils` default `Bus NNN Device NNN: ID vvvv:pppp <vendor>
  <product>` line, `-v` interface class/subclass/protocol names from the
  usb.ids class tables — decimal descriptor values, as `usbutils` prints
  them — `-t` bus→device→interface topology, `-d [<vendor>]:[<product>]`
  and `-s [[<bus>]:][<devnum>]` filters, the `usb.names_unresolved` fd-3
  advisory) over the same seams as `lspci`; the freestanding `Run` loads
  `Resources/usb.ids.bin` and degrades to bare ids (reason on stderr) on
  a missing/invalid table; thirteen-locale `Help/` with the
  switch-pinning test; host unit tests over a canned tree + a fixture
  database compiled through the real `lib/devids` pipeline.
  Reality-driven decisions: one line renders per *physical device* —
  the interface nodes the HCD emits are grouped by their shared
  `HwNode::address` (the device's bus position; two identical devices carry
  distinct addresses, an address-less node is never guessed into a
  group) — with 1-based ordinal bus/device numbers in stable bus order
  (TAIRiX has no Linux devnum registry — the §1.4 documented
  divergence) and no root-hub pseudo-devices; an identity the
  database does not name shows only its `ID vvvv:pppp` (the `usbutils`
  omission shape), counted on fd 3. The shared hardware-tree walk
  (fail-closed decode, stable bus order, depth, ancestor-keep, class
  labels) was hoisted into `tairix_procinfo::hwtree` and `lspci`
  refitted onto it, so the two listing tools render through one
  definition; `cargo xtask devids` now writes `usb.ids.bin` into the
  bundle and the `lib/devids/tables/` staging home is deleted. QEMU
  coverage follows the V2 precedent: the SP10b pipeline vertical spawns
  `lsusb --help` from the planted store (the resource-carrying bundle
  through the content-hash gate); no emulated fixture publishes
  USB-interface nodes yet, so the live listing is host-proven and a
  live-listing vertical rides the first emulated USB target that
  carries the system command store (Pi 4 metal acceptance otherwise).

---

## 2. Stage DEVICE2 — USB mass storage and hotplug automount

### 2.1 Target shape

```
xHCI HCD (drivers/bus/usb/xhci)
  └─ emits usb-interface node 08:06:50 (mass storage, SCSI, bulk-only)
       └─ drivers/storage/usb_msd  (class driver: BOT + SCSI over URBs)
            └─ emits one storage-class block node per LUN
                 └─ volume manager: partition probe → fs probe →
                    id:: root published → alias + Storage:/ catalog →
                    users read/write per mount policy
```

Every edge is discovery + match + public ABI (§2.20, §17.4): the class
driver knows no controller, the volume layer knows no bus, and nothing
names a sibling crate.

### 2.2 D1 — bulk transfers on the URB transport. **Done.**

- `lib/usb` serves real bulk transfers: a mass-storage interface's bulk
  endpoint pair (the first bulk-IN + bulk-OUT the configuration
  descriptor reports, never assumed) is configured at enumeration with
  per-direction transfer rings (`BULK_RING_TRBS` = 9) whose data slots
  each own a 4 KiB staging buffer, so several bulk TDs queue per
  direction (`queue_bulk_in`/`queue_bulk_out`, ring-full → `Busy`) and
  complete in order through the non-blocking `poll_bulk`; short packets
  report the honest byte count from the residual. A device STALL is
  recovered in place — Reset Endpoint → ring rebuild + Set TR Dequeue
  Pointer → `CLEAR_FEATURE(ENDPOINT_HALT)` on the **device's own** EP0 —
  with every abandoned TD answered, surfaced as the new distinct
  `Errno::EndpointStalled` (29) / `DriverError::EndpointStalled` (15) so
  the D2 BOT driver can run its own recovery (C headers regenerated;
  the generator's DriverError table also gained the previously-omitted
  `SEAT_REVOKED`).
- `UrbEngine` gained `bulk_in`/`bulk_out` (arm-then-reap, `Ok(None)`
  while in flight), `drive_urb` validates bulk fail-closed (never
  endpoint 0; the engine owns the endpoint map), and
  `UrbClient::{bulk_in, bulk_out}` are the class-side builders. The HCD
  stays the single wait-set event loop: `UrbService` holds a bulk URB
  outstanding and completes it on the controller event exactly like an
  interrupt URB; the class driver still holds **zero** DMA authority
  (the HCD bounce-copies through its staging buffers).
- Reality-driven fixes landed with it: the resting-context switch
  (`rest_active_context`) **parks**
  a downstream device's EP0 ring (`device_ep0_ring`) instead of dropping
  it, so a post-enumeration device-targeted control transfer (a URB
  control-IN, the recovery's `CLEAR_FEATURE`) switches to the device via
  `activate_device_control` and never wrongly targets the hub — the Pi
  topology, where every stick sits behind the integrated hub;
  `describe_device` derives the emitted node's class from the interface
  class byte (`0x08` → `Storage`, `0x03` → `Input`, else `Other`)
  instead of hardcoding `Input`. Teardown/reset paths clear all bulk
  state.
- Host-proven over the register-level mock, which grew a scripted
  mass-storage device (fixture endpoints deliberately EP3-IN/EP4-OUT →
  DCIs 7/8, two-endpoint Configure Endpoint, per-direction halt state
  machine that serves nothing until Reset Endpoint → Set TR Dequeue →
  device-side `CLEAR_FEATURE` run **in order**, and a hub-mistargeted
  clear STALLs EP0 loudly): enumeration/node emission, OUT/IN
  round-trips, short packets, in-order multi-TD completion + queue-depth
  bound, stall recovery answering every queued TD (direct and
  downstream-of-hub), and URB-seam validation; plus transport-seam and
  HCD `UrbService` bulk tests (held-then-completed, in-band
  `EndpointStalled`).

### 2.3 D2 — `drivers/storage/usb_msd` (Bulk-Only Transport class driver). **Done.**

- `drivers/storage/usb_msd/` (storage-class leaf, vendor-neutral
  namespace, §8): a pure user-space class driver binding
  `HwMatchKey::usb(0, 0, 0x08_06_50)`. The crate is a host-testable `lib`
  (`desc` — fail-closed configuration-descriptor reader; `bot` — the
  BOT/SCSI engine over the `MsdTransport` seam; `serve` — the
  block-service state machine) plus the freestanding `Run` program. Caps:
  `CAP_SHM`, `CAP_IPC_ENDPOINT`, `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` (the per-LUN
  serve endpoints), `CAP_HW_EMIT`, `CAP_LOG_EMIT`; no MMIO/DMA/IRQ.
- BOT + the full planned SCSI subset are implemented with every
  device-supplied field bounds-checked fail-closed: CSW
  signature/tag/residue/status validation, data-phase-stall → CSW
  fall-through, CSW-stall single retry, tag-mismatch / corrupt-CSW /
  phase-error → Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset; `GET MAX LUN` (STALL means
  one LUN, >15 fails closed), `INQUIRY`, bounded `TEST UNIT
  READY`/`REQUEST SENSE` ready drain, `READ CAPACITY(10)`/`(16)`
  (validated power-of-two 512–4096 block size; 16-byte form past the
  32-bit LBA horizon), `READ`/`WRITE(10)`/`(16)` selected by range,
  `SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10)` (ILLEGAL REQUEST = no cache = success),
  `MODE SENSE(6)` WP bit (a refused MODE SENSE reports write-enabled —
  the established meaning — while enforcement stays driver-side:
  `LunBlock` refuses writes to protected media before any byte reaches
  the device). Each LUN is a `tairix_abi::driver::block::Block`
  (`LunBlock`, chunked through the fixed 32 KiB window so per-device cost
  never scales with request length) plus a `Flush` seam (the `Block`
  trait carries no flush).
- **Reality-driven decisions.** (1) No block-over-IPC protocol existed
  (the existing block drivers are in-kernel bootstrap floor), so D2
  defined it: `lib/abi/src/blkio.rs` — fixed-frame `BlkRequest`
  (geometry/read/write/flush) + `BlkCompletion` (geometry + read-only
  flag, `-errno` status word) over a `BLK_DATA_LEN` = 32 KiB shared data
  window, the same call-endpoint + shared-window IPC shape as the URB
  transport; covered by the `fuzz_decode` harness. The `Run` binds one
  endpoint + window per ready LUN and emits one Storage-class node
  carrying them (compatible key `tairix,usb-msd-lun` — the D3 volume
  manager's selector), served on a wait-set; detach retracts the nodes
  and exits 0 for reload. (2) The emitted interface node carries no
  endpoint numbers and the bulk server validates them, so the driver
  reads the device's own configuration descriptor (bounded, fail-closed)
  to derive the interface number and bulk pair — the same facts the HCD
  derived, never assumed. (3) The planned no-data control-OUT landed with
  its first consumer: `UrbEngine::control_no_data` / `drive_urb`
  Control+Out+len==0 / `UrbClient::control_no_data` (the data-stage OUT
  landed later with its own first consumer, the D5 CBI ADSC channel —
  §2.7); the engine reuses the existing SETUP_TRT_NO_DATA
  control path. (4) The HCD's per-interface URB buffer grew from 64 B to
  one bulk chunk (`BULK_BUF_LEN` = 4096, the same page) so bulk data fits;
  a class-side transfer splits into ≤4 KiB URB chunks.
- Host-proven over scripted doubles: BOT framing, tag mismatch,
  reset-recovery trails, CSW-stall retry, stalled data phases, short
  reads refused, sense mapping (DATA PROTECT → `PermissionDenied`),
  capacity validation incl. a 100 TB-class unit, write-protect
  enforcement before the wire, chunk sequencing, sensitive-window scrub,
  multi-LUN CBW addressing; hostile descriptor streams; the whole
  blkio request surface over an in-memory device. The live path is Pi 4
  metal acceptance. The QEMU ports now carry the USB stack — the generic
  xHCI driver on the kernel-owned PCI host publishes interface nodes
  there (`plans/SOUND.md` SND7) — so the `qemu-xhci` + `usb-storage`
  vertical is unblocked and owed. The bundle ships in the Pi image
  (`Drivers/storage/usb_msd/Run`, signed, least-privilege manifest).

### 2.4 D3 — the volume forest and automount

This lands the still-open volume forest (PLAN.md P4) as its centre; the
work is completed here, not stubbed around (§2.19). It is staged as three
sub-increments, each green alone on the whole-project gate (§7): the
durable-identity core first, then runtime multi-root attach, then the
volume-policy service.

#### 2.4.1 D3a — durable `id::` roots for mounted volumes. **Done.**

- `lib/path` gained `Root::VolumeId` **in place** (§2.13 — no second
  parser): `id::<volume-id>/path` parses only from the canonical
  hyphenated lowercase UUID spelling into a typed 16-byte `VolumeId`
  (any other spelling is `VolumeIdInvalid`, fail-closed; `..` cannot
  escape the root; `Display` renders the canonical spelling and
  re-parses to the same value, covered by the `fuzz_path` round-trip
  harness, whose templates already mutate an `id::` form).
- The **kernel volume forest** (`kernel/core::fs::volumes::VolumeForest`)
  is the registry from a volume's stable identity to the live root:
  threaded `BootInfo::with_volumes` → dispatch hook → syscall handlers
  exactly like the other late-installed seams (fail-closed
  `NULL_VOLUME_FOREST` default), and read by the single kernel
  path-resolution entry point (`resolve_against_cwd`), so an
  `id::`-rooted path resolves to the `/`-view location the published
  volume's root backs and is then authorised by the secured VFS exactly
  as the equivalent view path — never a policy bypass. A nil or
  duplicate identity is refused at publish; an unpublished identity
  fails closed `NotFound`.
- `ARXFS::volume_uuid()` exposes the per-volume UUID (already minted at
  format and verified into every block header), and the boot mount paths
  publish both boot volumes — the read-only System volume at the
  `System` view prefix, the encrypted writable root at the view root —
  with the audited `fs.root.publish.{allow,deny}` events (4170/4171,
  drives.md §23). `docs/src/filesystem/drives.md` §12/§21 and
  `docs/src/lib/path.md` record the landed state.
- **Deliberate scope decisions.** Volume identity crosses the ABI only
  as path *text* today, so no `lib/abi` volume-id type is minted ahead
  of its first typed consumer (the D3c storage sysinfo queries,
  §2.3/§2.4). Forest unpublication landed with its first producer, the
  D3b runtime detach; the boot volumes themselves are published once and
  never withdrawn.

#### 2.4.2 D3b — runtime volume attach and multi-root publication. **Done.**

- **The ABI**: `volume_attach` (78) / `volume_detach` (79), both
  `CAP_FS_MOUNT`-gated and audited, taking the fixed-frame
  `lib/abi/src/volume.rs` requests (`VolumeAttachRequest`: endpoint +
  window + probed partition extent + fstype + validated catalog name;
  `VolumeDetachRequest`: the 16-byte volume identity). The attach handler
  additionally requires the caller's own kernel-minted resource grants to
  cover **both** transport resources the request names (the endpoint and
  the shared window forwarded on the matched storage node), so the mount
  authority alone can never reach another driver's transport. `lib/rt`
  wrappers and `tairix_sys_*` stubs landed; C headers regenerated.
- **The kernel blkio client** (`kernel/core::fs::blkclient::BlkClient`):
  a `Block` over the per-LUN call endpoint + shared window, using the
  `ipc_call` post → wake-server → park → take-reply discipline (a
  destroyed endpoint cancels the in-flight call — typed fault, never a
  hang). The window is reached through a counted **kernel hold**
  (`sharedreg::kernel_hold` over the new `SharedMemFacility::
  kernel_window` direct-map translation), so the frames outlive the
  owning driver's exit while the kernel still reads them. Geometry is
  validated fail-closed at connect; transfers chunk through the 32 KiB
  window; the device write policy is enforced client-side too.
- **Runtime-mutable mount table**: `Vfs` now holds its `MountTable`
  behind an `RwLock` (guards held only for lookups, never across a
  park), `LateFilesystem` shares drivers by `Arc<SleepLock<_>>` and
  gained `unregister` (a detached volume's driver drops cleanly — no
  leak per unplug, in-flight operations finish on their own clones), and
  the forest gained `unpublish`. A runtime mount carries its own
  permission template (`MountTable::mount_with_template`) because its
  mount point has no node in the boot layout tree; ancestor search
  authorisation still walks the real tree.
- **The service** (`kernel/tairix-kernel::volume_service`, installed via
  the `BootInfo::with_volume_service` seam → `NULL_VOLUME_SERVICE`
  fail-closed default): windows the extent (`PartitionBlock`), opens the
  matched filesystem (ARXFS / ext4 / FAT32), mounts under
  `/Storage/<name>` with `nosuid,nodev,noexec` (+`ro` per the device),
  and publishes the identity **last** with full unwind on any refusal.
  Detach orders fs-flush → device-flush → unmount → unregister →
  unpublish and fails closed (volume stays attached) on a flush error; a
  vanished endpoint (device already gone) is not a refusal. Audit:
  4172/4173 (`fs.hotplug.root_added` allow/deny), 4174/4175
  (`root_removed`), publication through the one shared
  `fs.root.publish.{allow,deny}` definition (4170/4171).
- **Reality-driven decisions.** (1) ext4/FAT32 lacked the
  `FilesystemStats` surface and any volume identity: both gained honest
  impls (ext4: live superblock counts + `s_uuid`; FAT32: an open-time
  FAT scan maintained by the allocator, serial‖label‖tag identity —
  content-derived, as drives.md §8 sanctions for formats without a
  UUID), and FAT32 gained the uniform restrictive `FilesystemSecurity`
  posture (stores refused — silently-lossy records are forbidden). The
  ext4 **formatter wrote a nil `s_uuid`** — a real defect the new tests
  exposed; `Ext4::format` now takes the caller-minted UUID and refuses
  nil. (2) A ARXFS attach uses the well-known key (non-secret volumes,
  as the System volume): a privately-keyed volume refuses with a typed
  error, and key-provisioned attach arrives with volmgr's key policy —
  the kernel never guesses a secret. (3) The mount template is the
  restrictive system-owned default until D3c's storage-group identity
  map lands; listing `/Storage` (the catalog *view*) is D3c's synthetic
  catalog work — D3b delivers resolution, not enumeration.
- Host-proven end to end: the lifecycle test serves a formatted FAT32
  image over a genuine call endpoint from another thread, attaches it,
  resolves the published root, reads the file through the production
  `fs_*` service, refuses a duplicate-identity attach with clean unwind,
  detaches (device flush observed), and fails closed on re-detach — plus
  unit tests across blkclient (chunking, hostile geometry, stall/detach
  faults), sharedreg kernel holds, mount templates, forest unpublish,
  and both filesystems' new stats/identity surfaces.

#### 2.4.3 D3c — `volmgr`: the automount policy driver. **Done.**

- **`drivers/storage/volmgr`** owns automount policy, as `devmgr` owns
  driver policy — but as a **per-node autoloaded policy driver**, not a
  singleton tree-watching service. Reality-driven design decision: the
  landed D3b security model gates the blkio call endpoint behind the
  kernel-minted per-endpoint grant (`ipc_call` refuses an ungranted
  caller before any byte moves) and `volume_attach` additionally
  requires the caller's grants to cover both transport resources; grants
  are minted in exactly one place, the per-node driver-admission spawn.
  A singleton watcher could therefore neither probe nor attach without
  new kernel surface, whereas the existing discovery/match/grant
  machinery gives the per-node instance exactly one device's transport
  authority — least privilege, zero new kernel surface. The crate's
  `BIND_KEYS` selects the block-service node's compatible key
  (`tairix,usb-msd-lun` today; a future hot-pluggable block source adds
  its key as data — the engine names no bus, §2.20).
- **The instance** (caps: `CAP_SHM`, `CAP_IPC_ENDPOINT`, `CAP_FS_MOUNT`,
  `CAP_LOG_EMIT`; no MMIO/DMA/IRQ/emit): connects a **read-only** blkio
  `Block` client (hostile geometry refused at connect; `write_blocks`
  refuses by construction), probes a whole-device filesystem signature
  first (superfloppy), else the GPT/MBR table (`lib/partition`), probing
  each present partition's head **by content** through the new
  `lib/fsprobe` crate (the one home of the ARXFS/ext4/FAT32 signature,
  label, and identity definitions — the fs drivers import their magic/
  identity from it, so probe and driver can never disagree; §2.2), and
  asks the kernel to attach each recognised volume (the D3b
  `volume_attach` path: kernel re-validates grants/extent/name, opens
  the filesystem, mounts under `/Storage/<name>`, publishes the durable
  `id::` root). It then exits `0` — run-to-completion; the kernel-held
  mount outlives it, and a re-plug re-discovers and reloads afresh.
  Events 4180–4184 log probe/attach/nothing-attachable/device-failed.
- **Naming is deterministic, never a coin-flip:**
  1. the volume's own label, sanitised through the alias character rules
     (ALIAS.md §5.2: lowercased `a-z0-9-_`, everything else dropped,
     leading separators stripped, empty falls through);
  2. else `<fstype><n>` (`fat1`, `ext1`, `arxfs1`), `n` the 1-based
     per-type ordinal in device order;
  3. a name the kernel reports in use (`AlreadyExists`) gets the
     volume-identity fingerprint appended (ALIAS.md §3.8, rendered by
     `tairix_fsprobe::fingerprint` — lowercase Crockford base32, spelled
     with `-` because the volume-name grammar has no `@`), lengthened
     4 → 8 → full per retry; distinct identities have distinct full
     fingerprints, so the sequence terminates. Re-inserting the same
     volume re-derives the same name (stable identity), so a user's
     scripts keep working.
- **Defect fixed en route (§2.18):** `lib/partition`'s `mbr::encode`
  silently *dropped* a `PartitionType::Other` partition (its type byte
  encoded as the unused marker). `type_byte_for` now returns `Option`
  and `encode` refuses an unrepresentable role
  (`MbrError::UnrepresentableRole`), with a regression test.
- Host-proven: the blkio client (hostile geometry, chunking, shape
  violations, refused writes, corrupt replies), the probe plan
  (superfloppy, content-over-type partitions, lying extents, blank
  device, device fault, per-type ordinals), the naming policy
  (sanitisation, fallback, candidate truncation/uniqueness), and
  `lib/fsprobe` (signatures, hostile heads, probe order, fingerprint
  bit-coverage). Live path: Pi 4 metal acceptance (QEMU models no Pi
  USB — the D2/U4 precedent); the bundle ships in the Pi image
  (`Drivers/storage/volmgr/Run`, signed, least-privilege manifest).
  The autoload gate's delegatable superset
  (`unlock_service::autoload_caps`) carries `CAP_FS_MOUNT` so the signed
  manifest is admissible through the store gate — the first metal boot
  exposed its absence as an `id=7006` capability-escalation refusal
  (the vcmailbox `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` precedent); the per-driver
  manifest∩superset intersection still binds. Metal re-verification of
  the end-to-end automount is the outstanding live check.

#### 2.4.4 D3d — mount-policy permissions and the catalog view. **Done.**

- **The storage-group identity map** (§5.3, §16.3): the well-known
  `storage` group is defined once (`tairix_users::STORAGE_GROUP`, seed gid
  `STORAGE_GID` = 100) and resolved **by name** from the loaded
  `/System/Security/Groups` registry by the trusted root-unlock step
  (`UnlockInstall::storage_gid` → the set-once
  `tairix_kernel::volume_policy::LATE_STORAGE_GID` cell). A runtime-attached
  ownerless filesystem (FAT32) is wrapped in `GroupMappedFs`: every node
  reports system ownership under that group — directories `0o775`, files
  `0o664`, `set_security` refused (the format cannot hold a record) — and
  the mount template matches, so any logged-in member reads and writes the
  medium without ambient authority while non-members read only. No
  installed gid (or a registry without the group) leaves the volume
  restrictively system-owned (fail closed, never an invented gid); volumes
  with a real owner model (ext4, ARXFS) are never wrapped. Removable
  mounts keep `nosuid,nodev,noexec` (landed in D3b); `CAP_FS_MOUNT_RELAX`
  relaxation stays future work with its own enforcement point.
- **Catalog enumeration:** listing a driver-backed directory merges the
  backed mounts sitting directly beneath it (`MountTable::direct_children`
  → the `fs_readdir` service), so `/Storage` enumerates the published
  runtime roots even though the parent volume has no node of those names —
  deduplicated against a same-named real node, rendered as a structural
  directory entry with the `UNIX_EPOCH` stamp any stampless backing
  reports (drives.md §10).
- **Provisioning:** the mkimage debug profile and the encrypted-root test
  fixtures seed `storage:100` and the seeded `root` account's membership;
  `useradd` keeps its coreutils `-G` surface (no hidden default), and the
  staged installer's account-creation step is where interactive users are
  added to the group.
- Host-proven end to end: the volume-service lifecycle test attaches a
  served FAT32 volume under the armed identity map and drives the
  production `fs_*` service as a member (mapped stat `0o664`/uid 0/gid
  100, read + write) and a non-member (write refused, other-class read
  allowed); the readdir merge, dedupe, and merged-name resolution are
  covered over the mock-backed mount service, `direct_children` and
  `GroupMappedFs` by unit tests, and the unlock test asserts the gid cell
  arms from the on-disk registry. The live path rides the Pi 4 metal
  acceptance with the D2/D3c precedent (no emulated fixture publishes USB
  nodes).

### 2.5 D4 — surprise removal, force-unmount, verified re-insert

Staged as three sub-increments, each green alone on the whole-project
gate (§7): the retention journal and the surprise-removal state machine
first, then the force-unmount exit, then the verified re-insert replay.

#### 2.5.1 D4a — retained writes + the surprise-removal state machine. **Done.**

- **The retention journal.** Every filesystem driver in the tree is
  write-through (`flush()` is a no-op), so the only bytes an unplug can
  lose are those the device accepted since its last committed flush.
  `kernel/core::fs::retained` holds exactly that set: `RetainedWrites`
  (per-LBA coalesced copies of written device blocks, bounded by the
  documented heap fraction — `CacheBudget::from_backing` — and gated per
  growth by `MemoryPressure::growth_permitted`; every buffer wiped on
  release) and `JournaledBlock`, the `Block` wrapper the attach path
  threads between the kernel blkio client and the partition window. It
  records successful writes, marks the journal **lost** on a failed
  write (the medium's state is unknown — the set may no longer be the
  complete delta), drops discarded ranges, and past a commit watermark
  (hard/16) issues the device flush (SCSI `SYNCHRONIZE CACHE`, via the
  `Block::flush` durability primitive `BlkClient` implements) and empties the journal
  on success — the quiesce-time flush, and what keeps a long copy
  committing steadily instead of ballooning to the budget. A committed
  flush also resets a lost journal: nothing is uncommitted after it.
- **The unplug trigger** is endpoint teardown:
  `callreg::teardown_owned_by` (the one definition both the exit syscall
  and the driver-store teardown call) destroys the dead task's
  endpoints, wakes the cancelled callers, then notifies the set-once
  `EndpointVanishObserver` — the volume service, installed at boot next
  to `VOLUME_SERVICE.install`. Ordering is load-bearing: the observer
  runs strictly **after** `call_wake`, so a caller parked mid-call on
  the dead endpoint can finish and release any lock the observer needs.
- **The transitions** (`RuntimeVolumeService::handle_vanished`,
  idempotent and non-parking — the attached-volume registry moved behind
  a `SpinLock`, with a separate `SleepLock` serialising whole
  attach/detach operations): clean journal → the volume simply retracts
  (unmount, unregister, unpublish; event 4176 — no drama, drives.md
  §10); dirty → **`unavailable-dirty`** (event 4177 with the retained
  byte count); retention abandoned → **`unavailable-lost`** (event
  4178, "uncommitted data existed and was not retained"). An unavailable
  volume's registry slot is re-pointed at the fail-closed
  `UnavailableFs` stand-in, so **every** operation — including reads
  `CachedFs` could otherwise have served from plaintext cache — reports
  `DeviceFault`, while the mount, alias, and `id::` root stay visible.
  A plain `volume_detach` of an unavailable volume is refused
  (`volume_unavailable_{dirty,lost}`): discarding the retained set is
  D4b's audited force-unmount, never an implicit side effect. drives.md
  §23 carries the new `fs.hotplug.surprise_removal.{clean,dirty,lost}`
  events.
- **Defects fixed en route (§2.18), each with a regression test:**
  `VfsError::Io` mapped to `Errno::NotImplemented`, misreporting a dead
  device as "interface intentionally inert" — now `Errno::DeviceFault`;
  and `Fat32::format` wrote a **zero BPB volume serial**, so any two
  TAIRiX-formatted FAT32 volumes shared one content-derived identity and
  the second could never attach while the first was mounted — `format`
  now takes a caller-minted serial and refuses zero (the ext4
  nil-`s_uuid` precedent; `tools/mkimage`'s boot partition uses a fixed,
  documented serial so images stay bit-reproducible — that FAT is never
  published in the volume forest).
- Host-proven: the `retained` unit suite (coalescing, watermark commit,
  refused flush keeps the set, budget/pressure exhaustion → lost, failed
  write → lost, commit resets lost, discard drops its range) and two new
  lifecycle scenarios over served volumes — a dirty unplug (root stays
  published, reads fail `DeviceFault` cache included, plain detach
  refused) and a clean unplug (root retracted, mount gone, nothing left
  to detach). Live path: Pi 4 metal acceptance (QEMU models no Pi USB —
  the D2/D3 precedent).
- **Deliberate staging.** The user-facing session notification (§2.24)
  is not emitted yet: no system notification service exists to carry it
  (the taskbar's notification area is an in-process GUI model, not an
  IPC surface), so the syslog/audit record is the D4a channel and the
  notification emit lands with the session-notification surface when one
  exists.

#### 2.5.2 D4b — force-unmount. **Done.**

- **The ABI evolved in place** (§2.13 — `abi-v1` is unfrozen):
  `VolumeDetachRequest` gained the validated force byte
  (`VOLUME_DETACH_LEN` = 17, a byte outside {0,1} refused), and
  `MountRecord` gained a validated availability byte (the former
  reserved pad — `MountAvailability::{Available, UnavailableDirty,
  UnavailableLost}`, an unknown state refused, never presumed
  available) plus the volume's stable 16-byte identity (all-zero for a
  mount with no published volume), so the unmount tooling resolves a
  catalog name to the identity `volume_detach` names without a second
  query surface. C headers regenerated.
- **The kernel detach path** distinguishes the flush-first clean detach
  from the audited force-discard: `commit_for_detach` (fs flush →
  device flush → journal commit, the vanished-clean tolerance kept) is
  attempted for an available volume even under force — force on a
  healthy volume commits cleanly and discards nothing — and only when a
  clean commit is impossible (unavailable-dirty/lost, or a flush
  failure) does force wipe the retained set
  (`RetainedWrites::discard_all`, buffers zeroised) and retract the
  volume, logging event 4179 (`fs.hotplug.force_unmount`, drives.md
  §23) with the discarded byte count and the refusing cause. A plain
  detach of an unavailable volume stays refused. The availability facts
  live in the `LateFilesystem` registry (`DriverEntry` gained the
  volume identity — a registration-time fact, threaded from the boot
  mounts and the attach path — and the availability the
  surprise-removal transition now sets), so `mount_snapshot` reports
  them without a second bookkeeping home.
- **`unmount`** is a new full command-app bundle
  (`userland/apps/unmount`, the df packaging pattern): the pure engine
  (parse `unmount [-f|--force] [--] NAME`, resolve NAME — catalog name
  or mount-point path — over the shared `for_each_mount` walk, refuse
  an unknown name or an identity-less mount locally, hand the identity
  to the `Detacher` seam) plus the freestanding `Run` over
  `tairix_rt::volume_detach`; caps `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` +
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS` + `CAP_FS_MOUNT`. A refused plain detach of an
  unavailable volume spells out the `--force` consequence on stderr and
  emits the fd-3 `suggestion` record
  (`fs.volume_unavailable_force_required`, `safe_to_autorun: false`).
  Thirteen-locale `Help/` with the switch-pinning test; `mount`'s
  listing renders the additive ` [unavailable-dirty]` /
  ` [unavailable-lost]` marker through the one shared
  `tairix_procinfo::render_mount` definition.
- Host-proven: abi round-trips (force byte, availability byte, hostile
  wire images), `discard_all` unit tests (dirty→clean, lost→clean),
  the volume-service lifecycle scenarios (snapshot marks availability +
  identity; plain detach of unavailable-dirty still refused; force
  discards, unpublishes the root, retracts the mount, empties the
  snapshot; force on a healthy volume still commits the device cache),
  the render marker, and the unmount engine suite. Live path: Pi 4
  metal acceptance (QEMU models no Pi USB — the D2/D3/D4a precedent).

#### 2.5.3 D4c — verified re-insert. **Done.**

- **The kernel volume service owns recovery** (not `volmgr`, which
  simply re-probes and re-attaches on plug — zero volmgr changes): an
  attach whose probed identity (`lib/fsprobe`, read from the extent
  head before anything opens) matches an `unavailable-dirty`/`-lost`
  record is a re-insert, recovered in place under the same handle,
  mount path, catalog name, and published `id::` root — never
  re-attached as a duplicate.
- **Mutation evidence is a dual-acceptance shadow in the journal,
  fs-neutral in mechanics, per-format only in extent.** `lib/fsprobe`
  gained `evidence_len` (beside the signatures, so probe and verifier
  share one definition, §2.2): the window any foreign mutation must
  rewrite — the whole `ARXFS` superblock ring (`ARXFS_RING_BLOCKS`,
  now the one shared constant the arxfs driver re-exports), the ext4
  primary superblock (write-time/mount-count/checksums live there), and
  the FAT32 boot+FSInfo sectors (honestly weaker; the format offers
  nothing stronger), each bounded by `EVIDENCE_MAX` and fail-closed on
  a lying header. `RetainedWrites` seeds the window's content at attach
  and keeps **two** acceptable per-block states — last-committed and
  latest-written — because the yanked device may have committed any
  per-block subset of the uncommitted writes; at re-insert every
  re-read evidence block must equal one of the two. A lost episode or
  an overlapping discard invalidates the shadow (fail closed); commit
  promotes latest → committed. Rationale for the deliberate divergence
  from the planned driver-side comparison: the in-memory driver is
  dropped at the dirty transition (D4a re-points the slot at the
  fail-closed stand-in), so evidence must live in the journal that
  survives the unplug — and one shadow mechanism replaces three
  per-driver evidence surfaces (§2.2).
- **Proven unmutated → replay**: extent equality is required (the
  retained LBAs' frame of reference), the retained set is snapshotted
  (`ReplaySnapshot`, wiped on drop), written back, the device cache
  flushed, and the journal committed — the volume returns to full
  service (event 4185, `fs.hotplug.reinsert_replayed`). **Any doubt →
  conflict**: retention lost, extent moved, write-protected medium,
  missing/stale/unreadable/mismatching evidence, or a replay/flush
  failure mounts the volume fresh and **read-only** in the new
  `MountAvailability::RecoveryConflict` state (ABI + C headers + the
  ` [recovery-conflict]` mount marker), retained set kept; a plain
  detach stays refused (`Errno::NotEmpty` — the device is live, the
  data is what is held) and the audited `--force` discard is the exit
  (event 4186, `fs.hotplug.reinsert_conflict`). A conflicted volume's
  own unplug re-enters the unavailable states through the same vanish
  observer. Never a silent merge (§5.4, §26.5).
- **Defects fixed en route (§2.18), each with a regression test:**
  `Fat32::format` wrote no FSInfo sector and no backup boot sector
  (BPB 48/50 zero) — format-nonconformant, and it left TAIRiX-formatted
  FAT32 volumes without an evidence window; it now lays out FSInfo
  (sector 1, "unknown" hints — deterministic, images stay
  bit-reproducible) and the backup boot/FSInfo pair (sectors 6/7). Six
  `kthread` host tests shared per-CPU resume/preempt slots with the
  production dispatch pipeline the syscall tests drive on CPU 0 — a
  cross-test interference flake surfaced by the whole-suite run; each
  now uses its own CPU index (the file's own convention).
- Host-proven: fsprobe evidence-window units (per-format sizes, lying
  headers, cap), retained-shadow units (dual acceptance, commit
  promotion, lost/discard invalidation, malformed windows, snapshot
  order + drop-wipe), and two lifecycle scenarios over served volumes —
  a re-insert of the pre-write image (device lost its cache) that
  replays and returns the volume writable with the dirty write back on
  the medium, and a re-insert with a mutated FSInfo that mounts
  read-only, refuses the plain detach, and force-retracts — plus the
  existing force-discard scenario. Live path: Pi 4 metal acceptance,
  and the `usb-storage` detach/re-attach vertical, unblocked now the QEMU
  ports carry the USB stack (`plans/SOUND.md` SND7) and owed with the
  D2 vertical above.

### 2.6 DEVICE2 increment order

- **D1** bulk URB transport (host-provable alone). **Done** (§2.2).
- **D2** `usb_msd` class driver (host mock + QEMU/metal). **Done** (§2.3).
- **D3a** durable `id::` roots — `lib/path` `Root::VolumeId` + the kernel
  volume forest + boot-volume publication. **Done** (§2.4.1).
- **D3b** runtime volume attach over blkio + multi-root
  publish/unpublish. **Done** (§2.4.2).
- **D3c** `volmgr` — the per-node automount policy driver + `lib/fsprobe`
  + deterministic naming. **Done** (§2.4.3).
- **D3d** mount-policy permissions (`storage` group identity map) + the
  `Storage:` catalog enumeration. **Done** (§2.4.4).
- **D4a** retained uncommitted writes + the surprise-removal state
  machine. **Done** (§2.5.1).
- **D4b** force-unmount (`unmount --force`, the detach force flag, the
  sysinfo availability mark). **Done** (§2.5.2).
- **D4c** verified re-insert (mutation evidence + retained-write replay).
  **Done** (§2.5.3).
- **D5** UAS + CBI wire transports and UFI floppy support (host-provable
  alone). **Done** (§2.7).

D3 is deliberately after D2 so automount is proven against a real
hot-pluggable block source, but its volume-forest core is bus-neutral
and serves the existing virtio/emmc disks identically — nothing in
`volmgr`'s engine names a bus; its bind table selects block-service
nodes by their own compatible keys, which is data, not bus coupling
(§2.20).

### 2.7 D5 — UAS, CBI, and USB floppy (UFI) support. **Done.**

- **One SCSI command layer, three wire transports (§2.2).** `usb_msd`'s
  BOT+SCSI engine was split in place (§2.13 — no compatibility seam): the
  transport-neutral command layer (`usb_msd/src/scsi.rs`: `ScsiDevice`
  over the `ScsiTransport` seam — `execute`/`lun_count`/`take_sense`/
  `scrub` — with `LunBlock`, the sense→errno map, and the bounded
  chunking) drives three sibling transports: `bot.rs` (`Bot`, the
  CBW/CSW framing, `GET MAX LUN`, reset recovery — unchanged semantics),
  `cbi.rs` (`Cbi`: the 12-byte command block over the ADSC control-OUT
  channel, a control STALL as the "command not accepted" answer, the
  bulk data phase, the two-byte completion interrupt in both spellings —
  UFI ASC/ASCQ and the typed status — and the Command Block Reset; a UFI
  failure's ASC/ASCQ is captured from the completion interrupt and read
  **in-band** via `take_sense`, exactly as UAS delivers autosense, so no
  separate `REQUEST SENSE` is issued — a real UFI floppy does not answer
  one reliably), and
  `uas.rs` (`Uas` over the `UasPipes` seam: tag-checked Command /
  Read-Ready / Write-Ready / Sense IU sequencing, USB 2.0 non-stream
  operation, in-band autosense in fixed and descriptor formats,
  `REPORT LUNS` unit discovery, every hostile IU refused closed).
- **Command sets are data, not forks.** `CommandSet::{Transparent, Ufi}`
  carries the per-device spelling: UFI pads every CDB to 12 bytes, reads
  write-protect via `MODE SENSE(10)`, and has no `SYNCHRONIZE CACHE`
  (flush succeeds without a wire round trip — the floppy medium is
  written through). The sub-class byte selects the set; the bring-up and
  serve paths are one generic body (`run_device`) over any transport.
- **Descriptor-derived transport selection.** `desc.rs` classifies the
  interface by its own `(sub-class, protocol)` — accepted: `06:50`,
  `04:50`, `04:00`, `06:62` — and derives that transport's endpoints,
  including the UAS Pipe Usage descriptors (direction-checked,
  duplicate-refusing; a malformed UAS interface is poisoned and a later
  servable sibling still serves). `BIND_KEYS` carries the four class
  keys; `devmgr`'s existing match machinery does the rest.
- **URB/engine surface grown in place (§2.13, `lib/usb`).** (1) The
  control-OUT *data stage* landed with its first consumer (ADSC):
  `UrbEngine::control_out` / `drive_urb` Control+Out+len>0 /
  `UrbClient::control_out`, staged through the control data buffer
  (`SETUP_TRT_OUT`, status stage IN). (2) A **STALLed control transfer
  is recovered in place** — Reset Endpoint + a rebuilt EP0 ring + Set TR
  Dequeue (the device side self-clears at the next SETUP) — and surfaced
  as the distinct `EndpointStalled` with the observed completion code
  preserved for the diagnostics; `control_optional` and the GET MAX LUN
  refusal ride the same semantics. (3) A non-HID interface's
  interrupt-IN endpoint (the CBI completion channel) is configured
  beside its bulk pair and served over the existing interrupt URB path.
  (4) Bulk serving is **per-pipe** (`BulkPipe`): `InterfaceInfo` captures
  up to two bulk endpoints per direction, `configure_bulk_endpoints`
  configures all four for a UAS-shaped interface (two extra 9-TRB rings
  per device region; the second pair shares the direction's staging
  buffers — sound because the URB service holds one URB, so one bulk TD,
  in flight per interface), and completion decode / stall recovery /
  event attribution route by DCI.
- **Defects fixed en route (§2.18), each with its regression test:** the
  mock controller posted a trailing status *success* after a scripted
  `GET_STATUS` fault (a real controller posts one event per faulted
  transfer), and ignored Set TR Dequeue / Reset Endpoint on the default
  control endpoint, desynchronising its EP0 cursor from a recovered
  ring.
- Host-proven end to end over scripted doubles: the shared SCSI layer
  (per-set CDB spelling, MODE SENSE forms, flush semantics, the bounded
  ready drain, UAS/CBI-UFI in-band sense vs BOT `REQUEST SENSE`), each
  transport's framing and recovery trails, descriptor classification
  incl. hostile streams,
  and the engine's control-OUT delivery, EP0 stall recovery, and
  second-pair capture. Live path: Pi 4 metal acceptance (QEMU models no
  Pi USB — the D2/D3/D4 precedent).
- **Deliberate staging (the remaining work, each with its own
  increment):**
  - **BOT→UAS alternate-setting policy.** Most retail UAS bridges expose
    BOT at alternate setting 0 and UAS at alternate setting 1; the
    engine serves only the default setting (`SET_INTERFACE` is not
    issued), so dual devices run BOT today and UAS serves devices whose
    default interface is UAS. The switch needs an engine-side
    alt-setting selection policy (configure the alt-1 endpoints,
    `SET_INTERFACE(1)`) staged with its own conformance tests.
  - **UAS command queueing, task-management IUs, and SuperSpeed
    streams.** One command in flight serves the synchronous block
    service; a protocol violation fails the exchange closed rather than
    aborting via TMF. Queueing and streams arrive together with a
    queued block consumer and xHCI stream-context support.
  - **Floppy media-change polling.** A medium inserted after bring-up is
    served on re-plug; a `TEST UNIT READY` poll cycle (one-shot-timed,
    never a spin) is staged with the removable-media policy work.
  - The interrupt-less CB variant (protocol `0x01`) and ATAPI
    sub-classes stay out of scope (§3).

---

## 3. Out of scope (explicitly)

- The CB mass-storage transport (protocol `0x01` — CBI without the
  completion interrupt), ATAPI/SFF sub-classes, and non-disk SCSI types
  (tape, optical) — later class-driver extensions on the same seams.
- UAS command queueing, task-management IUs, SuperSpeed bulk streams,
  and the BOT→UAS alternate-setting switch — staged in §2.7.
- Multi-tier USB hubs (unchanged from `plans/USB.md` §4).
- Writing the hardware-tree subsystem-id extension for `lspci -v`
  parity — a future `hwtree` ABI revision with its own consumer.
- An offline `update-pciids`-style on-target database refresher: the
  database updates with system updates through the signed image path
  (§19.3 forbids the OS fetching data-that-becomes-output from the
  network at runtime without the update path's signing).
