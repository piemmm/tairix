# FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP — Software-compositor and GUI redraw performance

| Item | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | Measure the right binary: the release build profile, the bench harness, the frame counters, their guest observation channel, the QEMU hover vertical | done |
| B | Blend no pixel nothing can see: opaque runs and occlusion, the dither, the segment composite, `encode_run` | done |
| C | Repaint the control that changed: one region type, the control damage sink, hover routing, per-app damage, text drawn and measured once, one shell present per batch, the bar's per-control hover | done |
| D | Blur costs what it changes: damage funnels, the retained frost, bit-identical blur arithmetic, family restack, desktop cells, rationed retention with every blur still drawn, reserved frost memory | done |
| D.5 | Half-resolution blur | planned: approved once its visual comparison is produced and judged |

| I | A dirty rectangle's rows composed in bands across a worker pool | done |
| J | One window-frame codec, and the desktop's decode spread across it | done |

Binding under `AGENTS.md` (§3, §15.18). This plan closes the standing
performance defect that the desktop repaints **orders of magnitude more pixels
than a frame changes**, with a per-pixel scalar loop. It is the software half of
desktop performance; `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` is the hardware half.
Neither depends on the other, and the software path is the mandatory
always-available fallback on every target (§17.3) — it is what runs when
acceleration is absent, refused, or falls back, which a backdrop-blur frame
always does.

**The order is binding: (0) measure, and check you measured the right binary →
(1) stop doing the work → (2) do the remaining work faster.** Vectorising a loop
that should not be running is forbidden; Stage F may not land before Stages B–C.

## Read first (§15.18)

- `AGENTS.md` §2.16 (performance first-class, measure don't guess), §2.2 (one
  definition, one blend path), §2.9/§5.4 (no panic, fail closed), §2.23 (no
  busy-poll), §17.1 (tickless, one-shot timers), §24.1/§24.4 (grown capacities
  vs fixed security bounds), §26.2/§26.3 (contended, memory-pressured operating
  conditions), §27 (foundational primitives are complete).
- `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` — Stage B's `PresentLayers` request shape
  (Stage E here evolves the *same* wire protocol, never a second one) and Stage
  D's per-layer damage (Stage C here produces it).
- `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` — the Reactive Alloy control model Stage C adds
  damage reporting to; the drawing recipes must not change.
- `plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md` — server-side window furniture, the chrome cache
  Stage D's frost cache is modelled on.
- `plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md` — non-blocking launch; Stage E's pacing shares its "an
  interactive loop never stalls" rule.
- `plans/SMARTRAM.md` — `lib/reclaim`; every cache this plan adds is a reclaim
  client with a budget, never an unbounded retainer.
- `plans/FONT-SERVICE.md` — font/glyph ownership; Stage C's text-measure memo
  lives in the font layer, not in `lib/controls`.
- `plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md` — `lib/cpuops`, the `lib/pagezero` candidate
  template Stage F copies, and the P3b axis correction Stage F depends on.
- `plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` — where Stage A's frame counters surface.
- `plans/WIRING.md`, `plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md` — Stage G's per-port work.

## Carve-outs and evidence

One per-control damage gap is deliberately left, and C.7 states it: the
program-library popup owes its whole panel for every change.

**Every published number is taken from a `--release`/installer image.** A dev-profile timing is never quoted as evidence.

---

## Goal / invariants (bind every stage)

1. **One blend definition, one raster path (§2.2).** `Pixel::over` / `div255` in
   `lib/raster` stay the single blend, reached through the one span composite
   (`blend_span`). Stages B and F add *specialised loops* over that definition
   (an opaque run is a copy; a vector candidate reproduces the identical
   rounding) — never a second blend, a "fast" approximation, or a forked
   rasteriser.
2. **Bit-identical output, proven.** Every fast path, cache, and CPU candidate
   produces byte-identical frames to the portable reference for the same scene,
   asserted by composing the scene both ways. A change that alters output is a
   *deliberate, documented rendering decision with a bounded, asserted
   difference*, never a silent tweak. One has been made: B.5's per-pixel
   dither on a *blended* pixel, whose bound is stated there; a copied or opaque
   pixel is still byte-identical.
3. **Tests assert work, not wall-clock (§7).** CI gates on deterministic
   counters — pixels blended, rects presented, controls repainted, IPC round
   trips, cache hits — which are load-independent. A wall-clock threshold in CI
   is forbidden; timings are evidence for a completion report, produced by the
   Stage A harness, never a pass/fail gate.
4. **No security or correctness trade (§2.17, §2.9).** `overflow-checks` stays
   `true` in both profiles; the fix for arithmetic cost is hoisting it out of
   the inner loop, never disabling the check. No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` on a
   frame path. A client-supplied damage rect is validated and clipped by the
   receiver (§5.4) — a smaller present must never become a way to smuggle an
   out-of-bounds rect.
5. **Every cache is bounded, reclaimable, and keyed by an epoch (§24.1,
   §26.3).** The frost cache, the text-measure memo, and any run/layer cache are
   `lib/reclaim` clients with a budget derived from discovered memory,
   invalidated by an explicit epoch (scale, theme, backdrop generation), never a
   fixed `const` retainer and never proportional to screen or window count.
6. **No busy-wait, no periodic tick (§2.23, §17.1).** Frame pacing is a
   **one-shot** timer armed for the next deadline; an idle desktop arms nothing
   and parks. Nothing polls for the next frame.
7. **Platform-neutral (§2.20/§2.21).** Everything in Stages A–E, I and J is
   arch-neutral. Stage F's ISA-specific candidates follow the `lib/pagezero`
   shape — a `build.rs`-emitted cfg, never `cfg(target_arch)` in source, so
   `cargo xtask cfg-check` stays green.
8. **Foundational primitives are complete (§27).** The region type (C.0) and the
   control damage sink (C.1) are the whole abstraction, not the slice the first
   caller happens to use.
9. **No speculative surface (§2.3/§2.4).** No ABI field, capability, or public
   method lands before the change that consumes it. This plan introduces no new
   capability; the frame counters ride the existing session→Switchboard feed.

---

## Stage A — Measure, and measure the right binary

- **A.1 Product-speed per-pixel crates in every profile.** `tairix-wm`,
  `-controls`, `-font`, `-window` and `-display` join the existing
  `[profile.dev.package.*]` `opt-level = 3` overrides, because the debug/QEMU
  images build userland `Run` binaries in the dev profile (`tools/xtask`
  `pie_build`). Overflow checks and debug assertions stay on.
- **A.2 `cargo xtask bench`.** The raster, text and whole-frame composite
  families run through `lib/cpuops`'s existing `BenchHarness` with a host time
  source injected through its `CycleCounter` seam — no new dependency (§2.12).
  Text draws through the production entry point with a warm glyph cache, or the
  figure would describe the mock service's reply encoding. Not a CI pass/fail
  gate (invariant 3).
  - **A small case needs a large budget.** The default budget leaves ±15%
    run-to-run spread on a 10 k-pixel case — the same order as a candidate's
    effect — so a single default-budget pair is *not* evidence. Use
    `--iters 400 --rounds 25` there; the megapixel composite cases do not need
    it, which is why the defaults stay low.
- **A.3 Frame work counters.** `Compositor::frame_stats` snapshots a per-frame
  `FrameStats` (damaged, blended, copied, frosted, encoded px, dirty rects,
  present calls, furniture-cache hits/misses), surfaced as the Desktop block of
  the Switchboard's System → Resources page over the port that already carries
  the seat report — no new syscall, sysinfo query, or capability, and a receiver
  that validates every count and fails closed. The load-bearing reading is
  **damaged px vs blended px vs screen px**.
  - **A monitor must not measure its own act of displaying.** The session
    suppresses a `FrameReport` when the only content served since the last
    decision came from the live Switchboard's own window(s); without that gate
    the panel rebuild is itself a frame whose counters differ, which sends
    another report, forever. Rate-limiting or quantising the counters is not a
    fix — the content gate is.
  - `FrameStats` deliberately carries **no** frost hit/miss pair: `blur_px == 0`
    already *is* the per-frame statement that a frost was reused, and a second
    tally would be duplication. Furniture has no equivalent pixel signal, which
    is why it has counters.
  - **The push channel is the monitor's; the pull channel is everything
    else's.** A.3's report is a push to one reader and reaches nothing else, so
    the same counters are also *published* as a cumulative
    `DesktopFrameTotals` to the System Information API (A.4 below). The two
    gates stay separate because their rules differ in kind: the monitor must
    not be told about the frame in which it drew itself, whereas the retained
    accounting is a truthful count of every frame composed, the monitor's own
    included.

**A.4's observation channel.** The counters are published where a guest
can read them: `Compositor::frame_totals` folds each composited frame into a
since-epoch `DesktopFrameTotals` (cumulative work plus the **worst** frame's
damage and blends, on a screen-extent epoch), the session submits it to
`sysinfod` under the ungated `DESKTOP_FRAME_REPORT`, and
`DESKTOP_FRAME_STATS` serves the retained record per publishing session to a
`CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` holder — typed, versioned, audited, decoded through
bounds no composite pass could exceed. `sysinfo frames` is its second
consumer, which is what keeps it from being surface added for a test, and
`lib/procinfo::for_each_desktop_frame_report` is the client every reader uses.
Liveness stays off the submission path: a full table consults the live set only
for a caller that is not already a reporter, and the reads resolve liveness, so
a departed reporter is never served.
The peaks are the load-bearing part: a hover that repaints one control and one
that repaints the screen have similar *means*, so an average cannot express
C.6's acceptance.

**A.4's QEMU hover vertical.**
`tests/integration/desktop_hover_qemu_aarch64` boots the production aarch64
graphical session on its own `FsDisk::HoverRootDisk` image, launches the
`framestats` fixture from the program library, sweeps the pointer the length of
the icon bar, and launches the fixture again. The guest judges the work between
the two samples. This is the regression gate every later stage tightens.

- **The reader is a fixture bundle, not the kernel.**
  `tests/integration/framestats_program` is a `command` bundle declaring a
  program-library folder, planted only on this disk. It reads
  `DESKTOP_FRAME_STATS` through `lib/procinfo::for_each_desktop_frame_report`
  under its own `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` and re-emits the eight counters the gate
  reads as one `log_emit` record, within the `abi-v1`
  `LOG_FIELDS_MAX` bound. It requires **one** publishing session and fails
  closed otherwise. A run that cannot sample emits its own failure record and
  the gate fails the run on sight of it.
- **The gate listens on the *diagnostic* trail.** `log_emit` reaches the log
  sink, never the audit sink, so this vertical installs its gate there and
  hands the audit trail straight to serial — the reverse of every sibling's
  wiring, because the witness is a userland record rather than a kernel
  decision. Nothing in the audit trail could stand in, for the D10 reason
  above.
- **The gesture is bracketed, and the epoch is not judged.** The published
  record is cumulative from the session's first frame, so bring-up's
  full-screen frames own both its mean *and* its peak: neither says anything
  about the gesture that followed. The two launches bracket the sweep, and
  pointer steps fire strictly in script order, so the sweep provably lies
  between the samples — no marker has to say when a hover ended, which is just
  as well, because nothing observable says it. The publisher's 250 ms rate
  limit only moves the window's edges; every counter inside it is work rather
  than time.
- **The sweep aims at the icon bar.** It walks the bar's own centre line from
  the launcher button to the Switchboard capsule in `SWEEP_MOVES` samples,
  crossing every control the bar draws. The bar is a desktop surface and never
  covered by a window, so the gesture needs nothing else on screen reasoned
  about first; the per-control damage under test is the same sink either way.
- **Bounds, all derived from the screen extent** so they hold on any board:
  frames ≥ `MIN_SWEEP_FRAMES` (an empty difference must not pass by measuring
  nothing), total damage ≤ `MAX_SWEEP_SCREENS` screens, blends ≤ 4 per damaged
  pixel, frost work ≤ one recomputed pixel per damaged pixel, no re-rendered
  furniture, and presents ≤ rectangles + frames. None divides by the frame
  count, so none is met or missed by how many frames the host let through.
- **Measured** (32-move sweep, `virt` board at 1024×768, five runs): delta
  frames 37–40, damaged 520 713 – 788 713 px — 0.66 to 1.00 of a screen
  against a bound of three.
- **`PointerPen::hover`** emits the run of motion samples; the enrolled-script
  invariant test covers the new script unchanged, because it still ends on the
  click its guest exits on.
- **What the gate found on its first run** was C.7 below — a bar hover
  repainting the whole bar — now fixed. What measuring the fix then found is
  that **this bracket is not a hover measurement**: the two launches that
  bracket the sweep dominate what it recomposes, so its mean is a bound on the
  launch path and stays at `screen/8`. C.7 carries the numbers either side and
  the deterministic host gate the per-control claim is held to.

---

## Stage B — Stop blending pixels nothing can see

Compositor-local: no ABI change, no app change.

- **B.1/B.2 Opaque runs *are* the occlusion cull, and there is no second
  mechanism.** `WindowRow::opaque_run` yields the longest run of source pixels
  that each replace what is beneath them exactly; `compose_row` copies such a
  run into the back buffer with `copy_from_slice` and encodes it with one
  `encode_run`. A copied run has skipped every layer below it — the windows
  beneath, the desktop layer, the root fill — for exactly those columns. It is a
  loop specialisation, not a second blend: *over* with a fully opaque source
  **is** the source.
  - **Sound without trusting a client:** "fully opaque" is read from the source
    pixels (alpha 255, full window opacity, no rounding coverage on the row), so
    a window whose *content* is translucent can never cull what shows through
    it. A window-level `opacity == 255` test would have been wrong.
  - Runs are sought only **within a blur segment**, so a blurred window stays a
    cull barrier and nothing a frost reads is ever skipped. A fade in flight and
    the rows the cursor draws on take the general path, because both change the
    bytes a copy would have written.
  - The condition set is stated once, in `compose_row`'s rustdoc and
    `WindowRow::opaque_run`.
- **B.3 Run-at-a-time encode.** `ChannelOrder::encode_run` sits beside `encode`
  in `lib/display/src/scanout.rs` — **not** `lib/abi`, which cannot name a pixel
  type without closing the cycle `abi → raster → theme/reclaim → abi`. It is
  defined over `encode`, returns the whole pixels written (so a short `out`
  truncates instead of panicking, and a partial trailing group is never
  written), and is not ABI surface. There is no bulk-`memcpy` case: `Pixel`
  carries no layout guarantee to copy through.
- **B.5 Blended pixels are dithered — the one sanctioned output change.** A
  blend into the 8-bit back buffer admits only `256 - a` of the 256 levels
  beneath it, so one fixed rounding stepped a smooth wallpaper into plateaus
  under a translucent window. Every blended pixel now rounds at its own bias
  from `tairix_raster::DitherRow`, resolved once per screen row and indexed by
  screen column.
  - **The bound, stated rather than assumed:** the dither's tile mean is exactly
    `ROUND_NEAREST`, so nothing lightens or darkens, and no pixel moves more
    than one level from the undithered answer.
  - Not a second blend: `div255` *is* `(value + 127) / 255`, so the biased
    divide is the same arithmetic with its rounding point named, and every
    unbiased operator delegates to it. Cost falls only on pixels that were
    already blending; the B.1 copy path pays nothing.
  - **The hardware path keeps the guarantee by not taking work it cannot do.**
    No layer stack can express a per-pixel dither, so
    `Compositor::has_translucent_window` sends a window-wide translucency
    through software exactly as a backdrop blur does, and a baked layer
    (resolved through `Window::row`) reads the dither at the pixel's *screen* position
    (`plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` A.3).
- **B.6 A segment is composed a layer at a time, not a pixel at a time.** The
  columns between two copyable runs are one **segment**, composed across its
  whole width as the base fill, the desktop row, each window row back to front,
  then the cursor — each a straight run at a screen column and a constant
  opacity, laid through `blend_span`, which `Surface::blit` also takes. A
  per-pixel `compose_pixel` no longer exists.
  - **What keeps it exact:** a window row is three straight runs (two furniture
    strips and the client's drawable pixels) *except* where the shape cuts it,
    and there `WindowRow::blend_into` keeps the column walk, as does the cursor.
    The dither is read at each pixel's own surface column, so a run split
    anywhere writes what the whole run wrote and a segment boundary that moves
    with a window cannot seam.

---

## Stage C — Repaint the control that changed, not the window

**[C.0–C.3, C.4b, C.4c, C.5, C.7 done; C.4a withdrawn]**

### C.0 One region type, in one place
`tairix_geometry::Region` (`lib/geometry/src/region.rs`) is the one region type;
the WM-private `DamageRegion` is deleted. It holds a pixel set as
pairwise-**disjoint**, band-ordered rectangles in a canonical form, so equal
sets compare equal, no pixel is composited or presented twice, and two far-apart
updates stay two small rectangles instead of collapsing into the box between
them.

- Surface: `new`, `with_budget`, `budget`, `is_empty`, `rects`, `bounds`,
  `clear`, `add`, `subtract`, `clip`, `translate`, `contains`, `intersects`,
  `From<Rect>`. `add`/`subtract`/`clip` are one linear band-stripe merge walk
  over a shared `combine`, whose two buffers are reused so a frame's edits
  allocate once.
- `translate` collapses to the clamped bounding box rather than wrap or drop a
  rectangle when a coordinate would leave `i32` range — over-cover is safe,
  silent loss is not. `with_budget` degrades to the bounding box past its
  rectangle count; `new` stays exact and grows.
- A `contains_rect` and a by-value `clipped` are deliberately **absent**: no
  consumer needs either (invariant 9).
- The compositor consumes it through a **compose plan** rather than
  damage-widening: damage touching a backdrop-blurred window whose frost must be
  recomputed promotes that window's whole screen-clipped rectangle into one plan
  rectangle (overlapping blurred windows merge, because each reads what the
  other wrote) and *subtracts* it from the disjoint residual. The frost sees a
  whole rectangle and cannot seam, while damage elsewhere stays as tight as it
  was marked.

### C.1 A damage sink in `lib/controls`
`lib/controls/src/damage.rs` is the seam: `sink()` hands out a
`Region::with_budget(8)`, and **two guarded writes** decide when a change is
worth reporting, so no family invents its own rule —
`damage::set(field, value, bounds, damage)` for one drawn field, and
`damage::move_mark` for an index-valued mark a container draws on one child at a
time. `RenderInvariant` fields report nothing, exactly as they fail to trip the
render gate. Both writes are **public**, because a host guards its own fields
with them rather than hand-rolling a comparison beside every setter.

- **The budget is 8** because a host pays twice per reported rectangle (re-render
  clipped to it, then present it) and the compositor refuses more than eight
  present round trips per frame, so a ninth could never buy a separate present.
  One routed pointer event produces at most four (child left, child entered, a
  child holding a press, the container's chrome), so an interactive frame stays
  exact while a whole-model refresh degrades to the one box it may as well have
  been.
- **No per-control `last` rect.** A container owns its children's geometry, so
  given a scale and theme it can always name both the rectangle a mark left and
  the one it arrived on (`TitleBar::move_focus` is the worked example). A
  control's *own* bounds moving is a host layout decision, and only the host
  that moved it knows both rectangles. A `last` field would be a second, staler
  copy of the host's layout with no render path reading it (§2.3).
- **Where a report is the host's.** A value the host commits back into a control
  (`Toggle::set_on`, `Slider::set_value`, …) is reported by the owner, which
  holds that control's rectangle at exactly that moment. A mark of the host's
  own that moves between two controls — keyboard focus — is reported by
  `damage::move_mark` over the host's focus field, after which the per-control
  flags are written unconditionally: if the field did not move, no ring moved.
  Focus landing on the host's own chrome maps to `None` and the chrome reports
  itself.
- **Container-mark setters are closed:** `Tabs::set_current`/`set_selected`,
  `Menu::set_current`, `TableHeader::set_sort`, each with an `adopt_*` sibling
  for a rebuild that shares the one admission rule so a rebuild cannot admit a
  mark the interactive path would refuse. `set_selected` sweeps *every* tab and
  reports each whose selection actually changed, because the owner sets each
  tab's initial selection and nothing may assume only one was ever lit.
  `move_mark` is generic over the mark, because a sort carries its direction.
  `ComboBox` adopts internally: every path that moves its menu's highlight while
  the popup is on screen already reports that whole popup.
- Deliberate shapes worth keeping: `ScrollBar` reports its **whole bar**,
  because its awake look is the whole bar, not the part under the pointer; the
  text fields never compare their buffer, so a secret field's characters are
  never copied into a comparison temporary; `cell_shows` is the one definition of
  which breadcrumb cell shows crumb *i*, read by both the render path and the
  report, so an elided ancestor's ring is reported on the ellipsis.

### C.2 Enter/leave hover routing in containers
`Toolbar`, `Panel`, `Rail`, `Decision` and the collection families track the
hovered and armed child and route through the shared `route_pointer` /
`grab_after` policy in `lib/controls/src/paint.rs` — one hit test per event, then
delivery to at most the child left, the child entered, and any child holding a
press. The grab is deliberately *wider* than the child's own latch, because a
container cannot see whether a disabled or denied child caught the press;
over-grabbing only routes further events to a child that ignores them. A
`#[cfg(test)] fan_pointer` oracle keeps the old delivery as the differential
reference.

### C.3 Apps present the rect they changed

No ABI change is required: `lib/window`'s `WindowClient::present` already carries
a per-present `DamageRect`. The decision is shared, not per-app —
`tairix_window::present_damage` over `Repaint::{Nothing, Reported, Whole}`, with
`damage_in` clipping a reported client-space rectangle onto the window (the app's
own fail-closed step, since the session refuses one outside the surface).

**The recipe, in this order per app:**

1. **Retain the surface.** Allocating *and zeroing* a window-sized `Surface` per
   present is a whole-window pass in its own right. The surface lives for the
   life of the window.
2. **Clip the draw to the damage**, which is sound *because* the surface is
   retained: every pixel outside the clip is the one already on screen.
   `Surface::with_clip` confines writes centrally (every primitive reaches
   pixels through `row_span_mut`), so no control needs changing.
3. **Convert and present only that rectangle.** The conversion itself is not the
   app's to write — it is `tairix_display::winframe::encode` (Stage J).

A round that changed the view but reported nothing presents the **whole window**,
not nothing: over-covering costs pixels, under-covering leaves a stale frame,
because the session copies only what a present declares. That safety net is
reachable (a focus step that finds nowhere to move reports nothing yet answers
"changed") and is **not** a licence to under-report.

**Every app landed with the same two-directional proof.** A host test renders
the app before and after every event of a scripted walk over its own controls
and asserts every changed pixel lies inside what that round reported; further
tests hold the *tight* direction (a hover reports exactly the widget entered, a
second sample inside it reports nothing) or the whole thing would pass by
presenting everything. Each app also carries its host-owned reports (a
committed value, a focus mark — C.1).

A model refresh that is not a control round (a clock tick, an animation, new
service data, a resize, a theme change, a first paint) keeps presenting whole,
which is correct and needs no report.

- **`widgets` is the control-tree recipe**, landed exactly as above.
- **`view` and `wallpaper` follow it.** Both hold one window-sized surface for
  the life of the window, reallocated with the frame region on a resize and
  adopted only once the session accepts the re-map. The viewer's engine paints
  into that retained surface — it allocates no intermediate sub-surface — and
  reports the page area and whichever bars moved together whenever the pan or
  zoom changes, which is the one commit its host makes into a control. The chooser reports its gallery marks through
  `damage::move_mark` over the tile rectangles (`Chooser::candidate_rect`), adds
  the preview model and its caption when the selection moves, reports the status
  line when an apply outcome is committed, and — the win peculiar to this app —
  reports the *one square* a thumbnail arriving from the sandbox fills, so
  filling an N-wallpaper grid costs N tiles rather than N whole windows.
- **The one wire-to-geometry conversion is shared.** `tairix_window::pointer_point`
  widens a wire pointer position into the signed geometry the controls hit-test
  in; the seven private copies (two of them identically named `client_point`)
  are deleted.
- **`terminal` reports from a *cell diff*, not from control rounds**, because a
  character grid has no control tree: `render::Screen` retains the surface *and*
  the cells it was last painted from, and `Screen::paint` returns the block that
  differs (widened to whole glyphs, so clobbering a wide glyph's continuation
  cell repaints its lead cell). Two things a diff cannot see for itself are
  explicit `Screen::invalidate` calls: new colours or a new face, and a session
  redraw request. A resize needs no call site — `present_frame` reconciles the
  picture to the `DisplayMode` describing the frame region, so a surface and a
  region of different shapes cannot arise however a resize half-fails. A screen
  effect *is* inherently whole-frame, so an active pass copies the finished
  screen into a reused buffer, runs there and presents whole, leaving the
  retained screen clean; the buffer exists only while an effect is on.
  - Its settings sheet's strip reports on both paths; the sheet's radios,
    sliders and buttons still need the `move_mark` focus report.
- **Translucency and backdrop blur are not passes**, so a see-through frosted
  window types at cell-diff cost too. An opacity a hair below full is invisible
  on screen yet takes the unpremultiply divide path and the compositor's blend
  path for every pixel; the fix is to remove that cliff, never to snap the
  slider to hide it.
- **`files` reports from *marks*, not control rounds**, for the terminal's
  reason: its rows, tiles and rail rows are built afresh from the browser's own
  state each frame, so there is no control to report itself. `sidebar::RailMark`
  (hover, cursor, keyboard focus) and `listing::ViewMark` (focused entry, scroll
  offset) are read before a round and reported after it, resolving back to
  rectangles through the renderer's own geometry — `render::entry_rect`,
  `SidebarView::row_rect`, `render::item_area` — so the reported rectangle and
  the painted one are one fact. The painter is `render_into`, into a surface the
  window owns for its life; the allocating `render` is **deleted**, and the
  session's picker allocates its own. Every other round is `Repaint::Whole` and
  that is the *correct* answer, not a deferral: a listing change, an overlay, a
  toolbar command, a resize, a re-theme each move more than a report could
  describe. The two conclusions merge (`Whole` wins), so a round that reported a
  rectangle *and* replaced the listing still covers the window.
- **`switchboard` already retained its surface and already had the sink** — its
  sections have reported into `damage::sink()` since C.1 — but the sink was
  built inside `Switchboard::on_pointer` and dropped. C.3 hoists it to the
  `Panel`, which is what owns "what is on screen" (the `Presented` record), so
  the report reaches the present. The composition-wide transitions the controls
  cannot describe report their own rectangles (a scroll marks the content
  column, a section change the whole client via the focus sweep, opening or
  dismissing the section list the popup's rect, and a Tasks selection the two
  rows plus the rail it re-states); everything else calls `Panel::repaint_whole`.
  `Switchboard::view_mut` is **deleted**: input routes through the panel.

**Receiver side is already fail-closed and needs no change:** the session's
`window_presented` refuses a `DamageRect` outside the client's surface, or a
frame shorter than the damage needs, with `Errno::OutOfRange`, and the
compositor's `present_window_content` intersects the translated rectangle with
the window's own client rectangle, so an over-large or negative one is clipped
and can never reach a neighbouring window.

### C.4 Draw and measure text once

- **C.4a is withdrawn, and measurement is why.** `BitmapFont::for_role` reads
  the theme's spec for the role, scales its size and fills in three fields — no
  lock, no client call, no cache lookup, no allocation — so `role_font()` per
  control paint is arithmetic and hoisting it into a `Faces` table cannot buy
  measurable time. It would also add surface beside the one resolver every
  caller shares (§2.3). Nothing is left of this item.
- **C.4b Text measurement is memoised in `lib/font`**, beside the glyph-bitmap
  `ReclaimCache` it already owns, so text caching has one home. The memo is the
  string's per-character **cumulative advance array**, the single representation
  all three queries read: `text_width` is its last entry, and
  `truncate_to_width`/`elide_to_width` are a `partition_point` over it (sound
  because saturating sums are non-decreasing).
  - **Key:** the face identity `GlyphKey` already uses (family, pixel height,
    weight) plus the text's length and CRC-32C. The text itself lives in the
    *value* and is compared on every hit, because the cache takes its key by
    value (an owned-string key would allocate per lookup) and wipes values but
    merely drops keys (a `Box<str>` key would leave titles and filenames in
    reused heap). A fingerprint clash costs a re-walk, never a wrong width.
  - **Epoch:** the advance-source generation, bumped when the font transport is
    installed. Face and scale are in the *key*, not the epoch, because an epoch
    change empties the whole cache and one frame measures several roles at
    several sizes. **Budget:** the glyph cache's own RAM-derived policy, reused
    verbatim.
  - The monospace path is untouched and pays **no** memo lookup: its advance is
    arithmetic with nothing to save.
- **C.4c A drawn run pays one glyph lookup per character, not two.** A glyph's
  coverage reply carries its own advance, so `draw_text` reads the pen step from
  the bitmap it is about to composite instead of asking the cache again; and
  whether a face is fixed-pitch is a property of the *face*, resolved once per
  run. `draw_text` is one `with_client` borrow over a `draw_on` seam (the shape
  `width_on`/`elision_on` use), which is also what lets a test count lookups on
  its own client. Correctness is proven by counts against a reference walk that
  draws the old way and must produce identical pixels and an identical final pen
  position.
  - **The fixed-pitch and proportional runs are deliberately two written-out
    loops.** A fixed-pitch run must not pay for an advance it discards, and
    sharing one glyph-blitting call gives both runs a closure that returns one,
    which measures worse on *both* faces; a single loop with a per-character
    branch is worse still and regresses the terminal's own path.

### C.5 One shell present per drained batch
`DesktopShell::handle` is split into `apply` (route the event, mutate state) and
`settle` (taskbar `present()`, then `sync_active_frame`, then `refresh_cursor`).
`handle` remains both, so a single event is unchanged; `pump` runs `apply` per
drained event **in order** and `settle` **once**, and not at all when nothing was
drained. The keyboard drain and the pinboard backdrop menu fold the same way.

Folding is exact rather than merely cheaper because each settled item is
level-triggered: the taskbar `present()` drains a set-like idempotent
per-surface repaint latch; `sync_active_frame` reconciles the *current* focus and
early-returns when it already matches; `refresh_cursor` re-runs the shape policy
against the current pointer. No frame is published between samples, so
intermediate values were never observable. A source that faults mid-drain still
settles what it delivered. `mirror_focus`'s conditional second present is
**deleted**, not moved.

### C.6 Tests + docs
Landed with C.0–C.2, C.4 and C.5 (region disjointness/subtract/budget/property
tests against a naive grid model; hover enter/leave reporting exactly two rects
and motion within one control reporting none; the routing differential against
`fan_pointer`; the shell batch producing one taskbar present and one cursor
refresh with the same final state; the docs in
`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`, `lib/controls/README.md`, `lib/geometry`'s
rustdoc and `docs/src/desktop/`).

Per app, the two-directional differential proof above landed with its C.3, plus
a whole present asserted for a resize, a theme change, or a round that reported
nothing (`files`: `sidebar_tests.rs` + `listing_tests.rs`; `switchboard`:
`view/mod_tests.rs` + `panel_tests.rs`).

**Acceptance:** a gesture's damaged-pixel counter drops from window-area to
control-area, asserted on deterministic counters rather than on the guest
bracket's mean (C.7 measures both and says why); every existing control and WM
test still passes unchanged.

### C.7 A bar hover repaints the control, not the bar

A.4's first run found the bar escalating *any* hover change to a whole-surface
repaint — 1014 × 40 = 40 560 screen pixels for a control about 40 × 40 — and it
is why A.4's damage bound sits where it does. Both halves of the mechanism are
gone.

**The account is per control, not per surface.** `TaskbarRepaint` no longer
carries five booleans; it carries five `tairix_controls::damage::Repaint`
accounts, each either `Whole` or `Parts(region)` in that surface's own pixels.
`Repaint` is the same type the menu chain already owed its plates, hoisted out
of `userland/gui/session/src/menu.rs` into `lib/controls`'s damage module beside
the sink the rectangles come from, so the desktop's two host-composed surface
families read one definition (§2.2) and `paint_parts` — the clip-per-rectangle
walk both paint through — lives there too.

`Whole` is what a change to the *model* owes, because a new clock label or a
rebuilt application strip has no rectangle smaller than the surface. A change a
*control* reports owes its own rectangles: `track_hover` reports the library
button through the shared guarded write and the application strip through
`damage::move_mark` (the slot the hover left and the slot it arrived on), the
capsule reports its own slot as it always did, and the picker's cell hover joins
them. The reported rectangles are screen rectangles, so each input site routes
them onto the surfaces its controls draw on and restates them in that surface's
pixels — `track_hover` and the capsule's click path to the bar and the readout,
the picker's to its panel. Which surface a report belongs to is answered by the
code that laid the control out, never guessed from geometry; a rectangle outside
the surface names none of its pixels, so a collapsed readout (`Rect::EMPTY`)
owes nothing. An expansion that *flips* still owes the readout whole: a window
appearing or being taken down is not a rectangle on one.

**The present updates the buffer instead of replacing it.** `TaskbarPresenter`
goes through `Compositor::repaint_window` — the seam `present_menu_chain`
already used for a menu plate — so the compositor marks the rectangles painted
rather than the window's whole bounds, which `set_surface` → `mutate` could
never do (a replaced surface is always assumed changed; comparing two whole
buffers costs more than recompositing). One path for all five surfaces, with the
fresh-window branch the only place a surface is allocated. `TaskbarRenderer`'s
five `render_*` entry points became `paint_*`, taking the destination surface
and the rectangles to paint, and laying the whole recipe under each as a clip:
only the writes are withheld, so a scoped repaint lands exactly the pixels a
whole paint would.

**That exactness needed one thing the review caught.** A plate *lays* its
colour rather than compositing it, so an interior pixel is replaced either way
— but a rounded plate's arc pixels are blended by their coverage, and laying
the colour over a pixel that already carries it only mixes it further toward
it, so a corner repainted twice opacifies (measured: α90 → α140 on the second
paint). `damage::paint_parts` therefore clears each rectangle before running
the recipe, which puts it in the state a fresh buffer would be in and makes
re-deriving it the first paint again. `MenuChain`'s own `lay_plate` had been
clearing for exactly this reason; the clear now lives once, in the walk both
paint through, and its plate-level drift is pinned by a `lib/controls` test
that fails without it. Both are asserted by painting the same recipe both ways
and comparing every pixel.

Stage D's invariants are untouched: `repaint_window` marks through
`mark_layer`, so a scoped chrome repaint drops the frosts of the windows
stacked *above* it exactly as a whole-surface one did, and the bar's own
retained frost is reused rather than recomputed (`compose_plan` promotes only a
blurred window whose frost must be rebuilt, so a repaint inside one costs its
own rectangles).

**A refused present keeps what the surface owes.** The presenter holds the
account and takes it per present, putting back whatever it could not draw, so a
heap that refuses a surface's pixels leaves the screen alone *and* is asked
again — where before the latch had already been drained and the surface stayed
stale until something else moved. A window whose extent no longer matches the
layout is repainted whole into a buffer of the new size, since a buffer of the
wrong size has nothing for a partial paint to keep.

#### The measurement

**The gesture, host-side and deterministic** — the same sweep A.4 injects
(launcher to capsule along the bar's centre line, 32 moves), run against a real
`Compositor` at 1920 × 1080 where the bar is 1910 × 48 = 91 680 px, measured
either side of this change on one tree:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| frames composed | 33 | 33 |
| damaged px | 436 822 | 83 268 |
| mean px/frame | 13 237 | **2 523** |
| a sample that moves a hover | 91 840 / 92 000 / 92 000 | **2 584 / 5 007 / 3 351** |
| a sample that moves nothing | 1 856 | 1 856 |
| worst frame (the capsule's readout appearing) | 107 158 | 18 502 |

A sample that changes a control costs 18–35× less, which is the 25× the
arithmetic predicted; a sample that changes nothing costs the cursor's two
rectangles either way, unchanged. This is the gate: a host test asserts no
frame of the gesture recomposes a whole bar's worth of pixels and that the mean
stays under an eighth of one. It fails on the tree before this change with
`sample 0 recomposed 91840 px, a whole bar being 91680`.

**A.4's guest bracket, same board, `virt` at 1024 × 768** (bar 48 672 px),
measured over five runs of the settled gesture: delta frames 37–40, damaged
520 713 – 788 713 px, blur 127 154, dirty rects 56–60, chrome misses 0. A
sweep sample costs 1 798 px — the same figure the host sweep below measures,
which is what says the guest and the host now agree about what a hover costs.

**A.4's bound is a ceiling on the window's *total* damage, three screens, and
never a per-frame mean.** The bracket is not a hover measurement: the two
launches that bracket the sweep each open a launcher popup, click a row and
close it, and that churn is most of what the window recomposes. Averaged over
a frame count the host chooses, that fixed churn read as a small mean on a
machine that composed many frames and a large one on a machine that coalesced
them — the same load dependence the frost bound was reshaped away from. A
total has no denominator: holding frames only coalesces damage, so a loaded
host measures less, never more. Tightening the ceiling onto the honest 0.66–1.00
would gate the launch path with the hover's cost lost inside it, so the
per-control claim is gated where it is deterministic, host-side, and A.4 keeps
its job of catching a gesture that starts repainting a window or the screen.

**What eroded it.** The embedder fires the library popup's one-shot "seen"
witness after every published frame, and fired it through `Taskbar::library_mut`
— a borrow that latches the whole bar and the whole popup, because the bar
cannot see into a borrow. So every frame dirtied a full-width strip, the next
frame recomposed it, published, and dirtied it again: a desktop that never
settled, spending 48 672 px a frame for as long as the session was up, and
turning a 1 798-px hover sample into 48 982. `Taskbar::report_library_shown` is
the witness's own non-latching route, mirroring `library_routing_mut`. Landing
with it: arriving icon artwork repainted the desktop layer **whole**, a screen
per delivered batch, where a decode can only change the picture inside a tile —
`Desktop::mark_icons` scopes it to the cells, and an empty column costs no frame
at all.

**Arriving artwork is adopted per item, not per surface.** The desk answers
which decodes came back (`tairix_icon::Landed`) rather than a bare bool, so
each surface repaints what the batch moved. The two that *store* a picture
compare before they latch: `Taskbar::set_apps` owes the slots whose
`AppSlot` actually changed — nothing at all for the re-derived strip that
matched, which is most of them — and the strip's whole region only when the
slot *count* re-lays every rectangle in it; `set_library_row_artwork` owes the
row whose picture changed, which is what makes resolving every shown row
before every paint free. The pictures with no model change behind them are the
class artwork a bar control with none of its own resolves *as it paints*
(the Library button, a slot with no bundle icon, the account capsule):
`Taskbar::adopt_icon_artwork` asks the batch whether each of those requests
resolves through it and latches that control's rectangle alone. The paint is
the other reader of that set, so a host test renders the bar with and without
the class tier and fails if a pixel moves outside what the adopt named.

#### Tests

- `lib/controls`: `Repaint`'s clean/whole/add/merge/`area` semantics;
  `paint_parts` writing inside its rectangles and nowhere else, skipping a
  rectangle whose corner is not addressable, and a part repainted over an
  earlier paint — a corner among them — landing the pixel a whole paint laid.
  The menu chain's own partial-repaint equivalence test now drives the shared
  walk rather than a hand-rolled copy of it.
- `userland/gui/taskbar`: a hover crossing two slots owing exactly those two;
  a capsule hover owing its own slot on the bar and the readout whole; a bar
  repaint scoped to a hovered control — one over the bar's rounded corner and
  one clear of it — compared pixel for pixel against a whole paint; and the
  seven existing hover assertions rewritten from `TaskbarRepaint::BAR` to the
  controls they name.
- `userland/gui/session`: an account owing one control repainting in place
  (same window id) and marking only that control; a refused present keeping
  what its surface owed; resolving the popup's rows before a paint owing the
  rows whose picture changed and nothing on the next resolution; and the host
  sweep above.
- `lib/icon`: a landing naming only the decode it answered, at only the side
  it answered; a refusal naming its request like a picture; a landed class
  master naming the request that falls back to it; and a teardown dropping the
  batch it wiped.

#### What is deliberately left

The **library popup** owes its whole panel for every change. Its
`PopupOutcome::Changed` reports only "the popup's pixels moved", and the
changes behind it are not alike — a moved row highlight is two rows, while a
scroll moves every row and a filter edit rebuilds the list, and neither the
scrollbar nor the search field reports anything for those. Per-row damage there
means every site inside the popup reporting its own rectangles, which is a
change of its own with its own tests; the popup does get the scoped *present*
path, so it costs a paint rather than a paint plus an allocation. Worth doing
when a measurement says a popup hover matters.

The one repaint that fired on a cadence rather than on a gesture — the
Switchboard tray republishing a reading every couple of seconds, of which a
calm desktop's only moving part is a value line the bar does not draw — was
already gone before this change: the capsule is gated on
`TraySignal::draws_same_capsule` (`docs/src/desktop/taskbar.md`).

---

## Stage D — Make blur cost what it changes

### D.1 Four damage funnels, because the kind of change decides what a frame owes
There is no bare `damage.add` in the compositor. A mutation uses the **narrowest
funnel whose reasoning is exact** — losing a frost costs a re-blur and never a
wrong pixel, so marking too widely is the safe direction, but *needlessly*
widely is the defect this closes:

- `mark(rect)` — a change not confined to a single layer: the root fill, the
  desktop layer, the density or theme every window is drawn with, and
  restacking. Drops the frost of every window whose bounds it reaches.
- `mark_layer(id, rect)` — a change confined to one window's own layer (content,
  position, size, shape, furniture). Drops the frosts of windows stacked
  *above* that one only: a frosted window is blended over a blur of the layers
  **below** it, so nothing at or above its own layer is part of its frost.
- `mark_overlay(rect)` — a change no frost can read: the cursor, composed after
  every window. Drops nothing, and is still a composite: the cursor is blended
  into the back buffer like any other layer.
- `mark_scanout(rect)` — the composed pixels are current and only the scan-out
  bytes encoded from them are stale. The screen reveal is the whole of this
  channel: it is applied as a composed pixel is encoded, and the back buffer
  keeps the true composed colour, so a fade step changes what every pixel
  *presents* without changing any pixel. `recompose_damage` encodes these
  rectangles from the back buffer as it stands — no layer, no cursor, no
  frost — after subtracting whatever the composite pass already encoded, so no
  pixel is encoded twice.

`compose_plan` promotes only a blurred window whose frost must be **recomputed**;
recomputing one drops any overlapping frost above it, because a blur spreads the
change far past the rectangle that caused it.

### D.2 The frosted backdrop is retained
`userland/gui/wm/src/frost.rs`: `FrostedBackdrop` (the rectangle's frosted
pixels plus the rectangle, physical radius and window shape they are a function
of) in a `ReclaimCache` keyed by `WindowId`, built by `frost_cache` from
`lib/reclaim`'s shared `stacked_ui_cache` policy. A frost is a *whole window's*
rectangle, so unlike furniture a stack of overlapping ones can want more than
the ceiling holds; the ceiling is a bound on what the desktop may retain, not a
claim that no more can be wanted, and D.13 is how a frame chooses which of them
to retain.

- The rectangle recorded is the window's **whole** one, not the on-screen part:
  a window pushed off an edge is frosted from the row and column the screen
  begins at while its shape is read from its own top-left, so two positions that
  clip alike are still two different frosts.
- **Epoch: `(scale, screen extent)`, deliberately not the theme.** A palette
  change repaints the layers below and marks them, which drops the frosts that
  read them. Both epoch components are already caught per entry, so the epoch is
  not what keeps a stale frost off the screen — it is what stops a superseded one
  staying *charged*. `set_backdrop_blur(_, 0)` releases the entry outright.
- **One counted lookup per frosted window per frame.** The plan and the
  composite both need to know whether a frost may be reused, so the answer is
  taken once (`frost_plan`) and remembered: two lookups could disagree,
  leaving a window blurred over a rectangle whose lower layers the frame never
  composed. The lookup goes through `ReclaimCache::find`, so a reuse records a
  **hit** and refreshes recency, and an entry whose geometry no longer matches is
  released before the lookup so the miss is counted once. `find` never enforces
  the pressure band — the frame enforces it once, before the pass — so no lookup
  can evict an entry an earlier one promised the same pass. The session
  registers this ledger with the process cache report, so the hit ratio is what
  `sysmon`'s reclaim page renders.
- **The cache is read-only for a whole composite pass** and written at the end
  (`retain_pending_frost`, through `ReclaimCache::retain`, which counts no
  lookup): admitting one mid-pass could evict an entry the pass had already
  decided to reuse.

### D.3 Cheaper, bit-identical blur arithmetic
The divisor is constant for a whole pass (replicated edges keep it at
`2·radius + 1`), so it is resolved once into a fixed-point `Reciprocal` instead
of four integer divides per pixel per pass. It is *exactly* the divide, not an
approximation: the rustdoc carries the proof, and the cutoff (`count <= 65536`)
is where the proof stops holding rather than a comfortable guess — above it the
divide stays. The output slot and the two samples the sliding window trades are
each monotone along the line, so all three are strided iterators bounds-checked
**once per line**. No indexing, no `unwrap`, no panic path.

### D.4 Tests + docs
The blur is asserted byte-identical to a **naive `O(area·radius)` reference** in
the test file over a spread of shapes and radii (1×N, N×1, radius 0, radius
wider than the region); the reciprocal's exactness condition is checked for every
count in range, that the cutoff is where it breaks, and against a written-out
divide oracle over every reachable sum at desktop radii. The frost cache is
proven by composing one scene three ways — reusing frosts, blurring afresh, and
retaining nothing — byte-identical in the scan-out frame *and* the back buffer
across ~30 mutations, plus the counter assertions for each funnel, the ceiling
and mild-pressure trim, and teardown. Docs: `lib/raster/README.md`, the `Reciprocal`
and `blur_span` rustdoc, `userland/gui/wm/README.md`, `frost.rs`'s module docs,
`docs/src/desktop/wm.md` (*Retained backdrops*), and `plans/SMARTRAM.md`.

### D.5 Decision (not silently taken)
Blurring at half resolution and upsampling is ~4× less area but **changes the
output**. It is therefore a rendering decision for the User, with a visual
comparison, not an optimisation to slip in. Left out of D unless approved.

### D.6 The vertical pass is not width-sensitive — measured, refuted, closed
The vertical pass walks columns with `stride = width`, which suggested a wide
region re-streams its whole buffer once per column and would want a cache-blocked
column pass. **Measurement says it does not.** The equal-area aspect sweep in
`cargo xtask bench --filter blur` is what settles it: at a constant area,
flipping the aspect ratio 25:1 changes nothing outside run-to-run noise, and at
screen size the *widest* shape is consistently the *fastest* of the three.

| shape | px | ns/px |
|---|---|---|
| 2400x96 | 230 400 | 11.66 |
| 640x360 | 230 400 | 11.31 |
| 96x2400 | 230 400 | 11.62 |
| 7680x270 | 2 073 600 | 12.82 |
| 1920x1080 | 2 073 600 | 13.02 |
| 270x7680 | 2 073 600 | 12.15 |

(`--iters 32 --rounds 9`, `tairix-raster` at `opt-level = 3` per A.1, Core Ultra
7 165H, ~2 MiB L2 per core and 24 MiB L3. The ordering held over four runs.)

Sixteen pixels share a 64-byte cache line, so the pass traverses the buffer
`width / 16` times in address order rather than once per column, and a hardware
prefetcher absorbs that; the ~13% step from the small area to the large one is
the working set outgrowing L2 and falls on all three shapes alike. A
cache-blocked column variant is therefore **not** Stage F work — it would be
complexity for no measurable gain (§2.3). Reopen only against a contrary
measurement on a target with materially less cache.

### D.7 A mutation that changes nothing marks nothing
`mutate_frame` — which all nine frame mutations run through — hands the mutation
a `damage::sink()`, marks exactly the rectangles it reported over that window's
layer, and releases the window's retained chrome **only when something was
reported**. So a refused mutation (an undecorated or non-resizable
`toggle_window_size`, a failed reallocation, a retitle to the label already
there) costs no furniture re-render, and `frame_pointer`/`frame_key` mark what
the furniture reported rather than all four bands. No caller computes a band or
invalidates a cache entry of its own.

- `raise`/`lower` on a family already at the end it is being moved to, and
  `set_active_frame`/`set_window_title` re-asserting what is already shown, each
  early-out. The activation rule has a single definition
  (`window::activation_for`) shared by the setter and the
  `frame_activation_changes` query, so the guard and the mutation cannot drift.
- The `InputRouter` consequently carries no damage region at all — repainting is
  the compositor's, at the point the frame is mutated — and the resize grabber it
  drives as a gesture engine reports into a sink behind `ResizeGrab::gesture`.

### D.8 A frosted window that moves keeps the frost the move cannot reach
A moved window's backdrop does not move, so the retained frost is still exactly
right — in *screen* coordinates — wherever neither difference between the two
positions applies. Only two exist, and both are confined to a border: the blur
**replicates** at its rectangle's edges (a pixel less than `radius_px` inside
either position averaged a different sample set), and the shape **weights** the
mix at a window-local coordinate (a pixel within a corner's reach was mixed at a
different coverage).

`FrostedBackdrop::reuse` therefore answers `FrostPlan::{Whole, Core(rect),
Blur}`, where the core is the shared rectangle taken in by the larger of the two
reaches. A differing radius keeps nothing; a resize and a corner change are
**not** special cases, because the coverage argument holds for them word for
word — which is why `reuse` compares no shapes for equality. An entry is
released only when nothing can be kept from it. A frost the frame recomputed any
part of is captured whole, so the next frame compares against where the window is
*now* — otherwise the core would erode a sample at a time.

The capture goes back into the pixels already retained
(`FrostedBackdrop::recapture` through `ReclaimCache::renew`), because a move
leaves the rectangle the same size and so the retained buffer is already the
right shape. Building a fresh one per sample is correct but frees a screen-scale
buffer and requests an identical one on the frame path, which a heap holding no
retention turns into a page of map, unmap and cross-CPU TLB shootdown per
kilobyte. `renew` requires the payload's charged size to be unchanged and treats
a resize as a refusal, so the ledger cannot drift; a resize or an edge clip that
changes the extent is captured afresh. The gate is the charge itself: a drag adds
no cache insertions (`dragging_a_frosted_window_reuses_its_retained_buffer`).

`Surface::frost_from` is the raster half: frost given bands of a rectangle — here
the border around a kept block — writing exactly what the whole-rectangle frost
writes there. `blur_span` produces the outputs of a line, not all of them, so
`box_blur` and the partial path share one sliding window, and `frost_region` is
`frost_from` with the surface as its whole backdrop, so a border and a whole
cannot round, replicate, weight, or dither differently. Two invariants a future
change must keep:

- **Every band's horizontal pass is taken before any band is mixed back.** A
  band's neighbourhood reaches into the bands beside it, and what it must read
  there is the backdrop, not the frost of it.
- **`blur_span` confines its source to the line before walking it.** The walk
  reads a clamped edge by letting a strided iterator run out, which breaks the
  moment several bands share one max-sized scratch — a band then reads a
  neighbour's pixels as its replicated edge.

**The layers a frost covers are no longer composed** (`compose_plane`,
`frost_spared`): a frost is copied over whatever is beneath it, so composing that
stack first is work the copy throws away. A frame composes below a frost only
outside what the frost will write — nothing under one reused whole, and only the
ring the border blur *reads* under one reused in part — as the disjoint
rectangles `Region::subtract` gives, never the box around them. `frost_spared`
and `frost_segment` both consult the cache with only a composite in between, so a
missing frost composes the plane and blurs in full.

### D.9 Any window that reads its backdrop retains one
A frost is a cache of the composed plane, and a *plainly translucent* window had
none, so every pointer sample of its drag re-blended the whole stack beneath it.
A second cache for the unblurred plane was **not** needed and would have been
duplication (§2.2): **a blur of radius zero leaves the composed layers exactly as
it found them**, so the retained entry already *is* the composed backdrop and the
whole retention path applies unchanged. All that was missing was admission — one
predicate, `Window::reads_backdrop` (a blur, or a whole-window opacity below
full), replacing the `blur_radius() == 0` gates in `compose_plan` and
`recompose_rect`. `blur_px` is gated on `radius > 0`, so a radius-zero frost is
not reported as blur work.

Deliberately excluded, because their backdrop is not a field: an antialiased
corner (a few pixels of arc) and a client painting alpha into its own content
(unknowable without reading every pixel). Both still composite correctly through
the blend path.

### D.10 A window and the menu it owns are one thing to restack
`Window` carries `parent: Option<WindowId>` — the window it is a *transient* of.
`Compositor::add_transient_window(parent, origin, surface)` records it and
inserts the popup directly above its owner and any transient already there,
refusing an unknown owner (fail closed). `raise` and `lower` move the **family**
— owner immediately below its transients — whichever member is named, through
one private `restack_family`, so nothing can be raised between the two: the
invariant a per-frame re-assert used to protect is now held by construction. A
family already at the end it is being moved to is left completely alone (the
settled check is a count and two slice reads, and allocates nothing).
`SessionWindows::keep_popups_stacked` is **deleted**;
`DesktopShell::open_popup_window` takes the owner and returns `Option`; and
`Compositor::remove` clears the transient link of anything the removed window
owned, so no stale link outlives a window.

A deliberate behaviour change comes with it, and is an improvement: the old
two-`raise` idiom pinned an owner topmost for as long as its menu lived. The
family restack keeps the pair glued without pinning it.

**The app half.** `ContextMenu::outcome` reads the region `lib/controls`' `Menu`
fills, answering `Ignored` when nothing was reported, so a sample inside the
highlighted row costs no render, no frame copy and no present, while crossing
into another row still repaints. `Settings::on_pointer` has the same boundary
fixed the same way. A round that reported *something* still repaints the whole
plate, deliberately: a change the sheet composes above its controls (a switched
tab's body) is wider than the rectangle the control that caused it reports.
Per-rectangle *presenting* of a plate needs a retained overlay surface and
belongs with E.2's rect-list present.

### D.11 The desktop layer repaints the icons that changed, not the screen
The desktop layer is the **bottom** of the stack, so marking all of it
recomposites every window above it and drops every frosted backdrop over it.
`DesktopOutcome::redraw` is **deleted**: `set_focused`, `pointer_moved`,
`pointer_left`, `press`, `context_press` and `key` each take a
`tairix_geometry::Region` sink and add the *cell rectangle* of every icon whose
appearance changed — hover left and hover taken, old selection and new, the
selected icon whose focus ring appeared or disappeared. One private
`Desktop::mark_cell` spells that rule once, and `IconTile::render` draws strictly
inside its cell, so the cell is the whole of repainting the icon. A gesture that
changes nothing visible adds nothing and composes **no frame**.

`Compositor::repaint_desktop(area, paint)` hands the painter the rectangles of
`area` clipped to the layer and marks exactly those; a freshly allocated layer is
still painted whole, holding no pixels a partial paint could preserve.
`DesktopShell::present_desktop_area` paints each rectangle under a narrowed
surface clip, and `present_desktop` is now the whole-screen case of the same call
— kept for the changes that genuinely alter the whole layer: bring-up, a new
wallpaper, a theme switch, adopted settings, and a re-list that moved the icons
(which is why a re-list reports `relisted` rather than cells).

**A latent rendering defect closed with it:** the painter used to skip the
backdrop fill when the wallpaper surface was screen-sized, but `lib/sandbox`
leaves a letterboxed or centred placement's margins *fully transparent* on
purpose, so those margins showed the root fill on the first paint and stale
pixels afterwards. The backdrop colour is now laid down first and the wallpaper
composited over it, which is also what makes a partial repaint total.

### D.12 A restack marks where it crossed, not what it moved
**Reordering two windows that do not overlap changes no pixel** — nothing is
drawn differently and no frost sees a different backdrop, so there is nothing to
mark. `restack_family` asks `crossed_footprints` for the windows the family actually
swaps sides with (those above it when moving to the front, below it when moving
to the back, visible only) and marks each moved member's bounds **intersected**
with each of them. Windows on the far side keep their relative order with the
family and so see exactly the stack they always did.

This matters because the taskbar sits above every application window, so an app
is essentially never frontmost: the raise that brings a family forward always
crosses the bar, and the bar's own `keep_topmost` re-assert crosses back. Both
crossings used to mark a large translucent window in full and drop its frost.

---

### D.13 Retention is rationed, front to back; a blur never is
A frost is a whole window's rectangle and stacked frosted windows all read the
same pixels, so `n` of them want `n` screenfuls of retention against a budget
that may hold far fewer. Granting retention one window at a time — "does one
more fit?" — answers *yes* for every window in such a stack, so each frame
would blur one, evict another and re-blur it the next.

**The bound.** `Compositor::grant_backdrops` spends the cache's live ceiling from
the **front** of the stack, once per frame, before the frame takes its damage
and before the band is enforced, and what it reaches is **retained**
(`Window::is_retained`). Enforcing first would evict the least recently looked
at, which can be the one frost the ration then keeps; the session's
`trim_frost` settles the ration first for the same reason.

- `ReclaimCache::holds(entries, payload)` weighs the whole set being chosen
  against the live band's ceiling, rather than one entry against what is charged.
- **The ceiling is spent a tier at a time** (`FrostTier`), front to back within
  each: blurred desktop chrome (`!Window::is_app_presented` — the taskbar, a
  session dialog, the lock screen), then blurred application windows, then
  everything unblurred. Chrome is permanently on screen, yet deliberately not
  pinned topmost, so weighed in one sweep it kept its retention only while the
  applications left a bar-sized slice over. An unblurred window stays last: its
  retention only saves recomposing the stack beneath it.
- The ceiling is the machine's share of its memory, never below one screenful
  (`tairix_reclaim::stacked_ui_cache`, fed the session's `memory_total`); mild
  and moderate pressure take it back to one screenful, severe to the shared
  reserve. Because the frame never over-commits, nothing is admitted only to be
  evicted (asserted).

**Frosting is not rationed.** Every visible blurred window is frosted
(`Window::is_frosted`) every frame it shows: the cache is an accelerator, never
a condition of drawing the blur. A plainly translucent window is frosted only
while retained, since composing it over an unkept frost of radius zero is
blending it straight through. Neither answer changes a pixel, so a change of
the ration's mind marks nothing; a window that loses retention gives its entry
back at once.

**An unretained frost is recomputed where the frame needs it**
(`FrostPlan::Local`). Its backdrop unchanged, the frost on screen is still right
outside the damage, so only the damaged part the frosts above leave seen
(`seen_through`) is blurred. The backdrop it reads past the damage's edge is not
in the back buffer — that holds finished pixels there — so the layers beneath are
composed into the frost plane over that ring (`compose_below`). That needs every
frost beneath it within its rectangle to be copied whole from the cache, so the
ring never needs a frost of its own; where one is not, the window is promoted
whole instead, which reads no ring, and drops no frost above it, since its
pixels come out as they were. A changed backdrop is recomputed whole, as a
retained frost's is. The plan asks nothing of a window touched only where frosts
above it are copied whole (`recomposed_and_seen`): those replace everything
beneath them, and nothing beneath one can have changed without dropping it. The
composite leaves the same window's frost out wherever it composes it hidden,
whatever its plan (`seen_through`), and both ask the frosts above front first,
so one hidden by another costs no lookup.

**What it costs, asserted.** With nothing retained at all, the D.4 sweep composes
every one of its mutations to the same bytes as the retaining compositor. On
the cascade, a cell repainted in the front window blurs **0** px and recomposes
under 4 000. With the Switchboard dragged over a Settings window pressure would
not retain, every frame equals the one a machine retaining both draws and
recomposes exactly as many pixels, and a cursor sample over the unretained glass
blurs at most 64 px. A change beneath a deep stack of unretained glass
recomputes, whole, every frost above it that it reaches.

### D.14 A frost's working memory is reserved
A frost grown on demand is one a machine short of memory refuses, so nothing a
frost needs is allocated on the frame path. `Compositor::frost_plane` — a
screenful — and the `BlurScratch` (`reserve`, for the output, `FROST_BANDS`
bands and the installed runner) are allocated with the back buffer, and a mode
the compositor cannot reserve them for is refused like one it cannot allocate a
back buffer for. A runner the scratch could not be reserved for spreads a frost
across fewer participants; it never fails one.

`Surface::frost_from` reads the backdrop from the destination within the part it
holds (`Frosting::held` — the damaged rectangle) and from the plane elsewhere,
writes the horizontal pass into the plane, and runs the vertical pass in strips
of a quarter of the reserved height, each column piece carrying its running sums
from strip to strip. Nothing it holds grows with a frost's area. Against the
whole-area intermediates it replaced, measured on the host (`opt-level = 3`, 8
persistent workers, Core Ultra 7 165H, minimum of 41–81 runs): 7.8 ns/px
serially against 10.2–12.8, and 1.43–1.51 against 1.50–1.62 at 1920×1080 on 8
threads, the smaller rectangles within run-to-run noise of each other.

## Stage E — One present per frame, and a frame deadline

Touches the display wire protocol, so it must be one evolution with
`plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` Stage B, not a second shape (§2.2, §2.13).

### E.1 Keep the damage region disjoint
The damage region is `tairix_geometry::Region`, whose rectangles are disjoint and
band-canonical, so a scattered frame stays scattered rather than coalescing to
unions. E.2 carries that to the driver.

### E.2 One present per frame, carrying a list of rects
A frame is presented **once**, naming every disjoint rectangle it changed.
`Display::present_rects(&[DamageRect])` is the one damage-aware present — there
is no per-rectangle entry point beside it — and the `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` `Present`
request carries a fixed-width, self-validating `DamageList` of up to
`MAX_DAMAGE_RECTS` rectangles, the one wire shape
`plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` Stage B extends. The invariants later work
must keep:

- **The ring rotates once per frame.** `RemoteDisplay` holds each frame's
  outstanding damage as a disjoint `Region`, so a buffer catching up copies the
  rectangles it missed rather than one box spanning them. The region's budget is
  *derived* — ring depth × `MAX_DAMAGE_RECTS` — so a double-buffered desktop's
  scattered catch-up never degrades to that box. A buffer is still wholly
  current after its present, which is what lets a driver scan it out in full.
- **Covering the screen and spanning it are different questions.**
  `tairix_display::damage_list` is the single place that chooses between the
  rectangle list, its bounding box (past the bound) and the whole-frame present.
  Two far-apart corners span the screen while changing a few dozen pixels.
- **The whole list is validated before any pixel is blitted**
  (`DamageRect::validate_list`), so a bad rectangle refuses the present rather
  than leaving the ones before it on screen.
- **`MAX_DAMAGE_RECTS` is a format bound (§24.4), not a capacity**: it is what
  one fixed-width request carries, and a producer holding more rectangles
  presents their bounding box. There is no *per-call* rectangle limit to
  reintroduce — a frame publishes once, so no cost model trades rectangles
  against round trips.

### E.3 One-shot frame pacing in the session
The session composites at most once per frame period however many wakes fed it.
`FramePacer` (`userland/gui/session/src/pace.rs`) is the whole policy: the run
loop asks `admit(now_ns, Compositor::has_damage())` at each of its two present
sites, damage accumulates in the compositor between deadlines, and a held frame
shortens the park through the same `park_within` fold the clock, the reveal, the
lock and the frame report use — so a desktop with nothing held arms nothing
(§17.1, §2.23). The invariants later work must keep:

- **Latency is paid only where a frame would have been wasted.** A frame whose
  period has elapsed is admitted on the wake that produced it, so a click, a
  keystroke, and every interaction slower than the display cost nothing. Only a
  producer outrunning the screen is held.
- **The period is the one the desktop already animates at.**
  `tairix_theme::Timeline::FRAME_NS` is the shortest gap between two frames
  worth drawing, which is the same fact for an animation step and a drag, so
  there is no second frame-period constant (§2.2) and an animated surface is
  never woken for a frame the pacer would refuse. A refresh taken from the mode
  would be an ABI field with no producer; real vsync off the flip signal is
  `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` Stage E.
- **`admit` holds only what is not yet due**, so the deadline it arms is never
  zero-length and the loop cannot spin between a refusal and its frame.
- **An undamaged frame is never held and never starts the period.** Presenting
  one moves nothing and is what re-reads the counters as idle for A.3's report;
  holding it would suppress that reading and starting the period would put the
  next real frame behind a frame that changed no pixels.
- **The compositor owns the damage, the pacer only the clock**
  (`Compositor::has_damage` is the one answer to whether a composite would
  recompose a pixel), and a clock that jumped backwards admits rather than
  freezing the screen for the length of the jump.
- **The clock reads the wall clock only when its minute is due**
  (`SessionClock::is_due`, the deadline its park is shortened to), so a wake for
  anything else costs no read; a wall-clock step reaches the bar at the next
  minute.
- **The departure fade is deliberately unpaced**: it runs on its own timed park
  with the seat still held, because it is the last thing the session draws and
  must complete before the screen is handed on.

### E.4 Tests + docs
The present-side tests and docs landed with E.2 (one transport call per frame
however scattered; a rectangle-sized catch-up copy; the existing double-buffer
tests unchanged). E.3's are `userland/gui/session/src/pace_tests.rs`: a flood
inside one period costing one composite and a sustained flood no more than one
per period; an idle session and every undamaged frame arming nothing; a held
frame arming exactly the time left and never a zero-length deadline (asserted on
the park value, not on timing); an animation's cadence frames never deferred;
and the clock-jump and long-background paths admitting rather than stalling.
Beside the frame-cost tests, sixteen pointer samples pumped through the real
shell and compositor inside one period — each moving the cursor, so each really
does damage the screen — composite nothing until that deadline.

**Acceptance:** CPU at idle unchanged from parked — the pacer folds
`WAITSET_TIMEOUT_NONE` through untouched whenever nothing is held.

---

## Stage F — CPU-dispatched raster kernels (`lib/cpuops`)

This is the honest answer to "can CPU feature detection help?": yes, and it is
the *last* 20%. It may not land before B–C.

### F.0 The axis is the capability one
The raster families select on the **capability** axis (`ByPriority`), never by
measurement, and are therefore not waiting on the userland-measurement design
that blocks `ByBenchmark`. The reasoning and the per-target state live in
`plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md` P3c, which is where that plan now records them;
a packed-SIMD premultiplied `over` is unconditionally faster and bit-identical
when the vector form rounds identically, so nothing varies by microarchitecture
for a benchmark to decide.

`lib/rt`'s startup already delivers the kernel-folded common `CpuFeatureSet`
(`cpu_features()`) and `lib/cpuops` is a plain `lib/*` crate with no kernel edge,
so selection works with no kernel mechanism and no ABI change.

### F.1 Make the loops vectorisable before reaching for intrinsics

It was most of the win, and **not** because anything vectorised. Two things
stood between the per-pixel arithmetic and the optimiser, and both were in the
source rather than in the ISA:

- **A per-pixel operator that is an out-of-line call is not an operator.**
  `lib/raster`'s leaf arithmetic (`div255_biased`, `Pixel::over_biased`,
  `scale_alpha_biased`, `premultiply`/`unpremultiply`, `mix`,
  `DitherRow::bias`) carried no `#[inline]`, and the desktop's userland crates
  are built with many codegen units and no LTO in the profile the debug image
  and `cargo xtask bench` both use. Every blended pixel therefore paid **two
  indirect calls** — `scale_alpha_biased` then `over_biased` — with nothing
  around them the optimiser could touch. A1's per-package `opt-level = 3` could
  not buy this; only the attribute can.
- **A `RangeFrom` counter in the inner loop is a panic branch.**
  `zip(first_x..)` is an *unbounded* range, so its `Step::forward` is checked
  and carries a panic edge through every iteration, which stops the loop being
  vectorised or unrolled at all. The fix is invariant 4's: hoist it.
  A crate-private `DitherRow::tile_at` resolves the eight biases of a span's
  own first column once — eight is the pattern's period — and `blend_span`
  walks whole eight-pixel tiles and then the remainder, deriving no surface
  column. A
  bounded `Range` alone would have removed the panic edge; the tile is worth a
  further 1.28× on top of it, measured, which is why it is the shape that
  landed. `dither_tiles` is the same walk for the paints whose source is one
  colour rather than a second span (a translucent plate, a wash).

Splitting cannot seam: a pixel takes the bias of its own surface column either
way, and a remainder begins a whole number of periods along. The existing
per-pixel differential oracles (`color_tests`' `pixel_by_pixel`, `tests.rs`'
`reference_round_rect`) hold, plus every length across the tile boundary at
every phase and `tile_at` against `bias`.

**Measured** — one whole-suite `cargo xtask bench` run at the defaults either
side of the change (Core Ultra 7 165H), because a single-family run and a
whole-suite run do not sit at the same thermal or cache state and only like may
be compared with like. The small cases are omitted: their spread swamps the
effect at the default budget (A.2). The families this change does not touch are
the **control** on that spread — `box_blur` moved −5%, `resample` −4% and
`text_width` −5% between the two runs, so a figure below is meaningful only
because every one of them is far outside that band.

| case (ns/px) | before | after | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blit` opaque 1280x800 | 1.96 | **0.90** | 2.17× |
| `blit` translucent 1280x800 | 3.87 | **3.20** | 1.21× |
| `round-rect` 400x240 r16 | 3.66 | **2.19** | 1.67× |
| `round-rect` 1280x64 r24 | 3.89 | **2.42** | 1.61× |
| `text` draw proportional row | 3.11 | **2.35** | 1.32× |
| `text` draw monospace row | 2.84 | **2.16** | 1.31× |
| `blur` frost_region 640x360 r12 | 15.06 | **12.70** | 1.19× |
| `composite` full screen, opaque | 0.81 | **0.52** | 1.56× |
| `composite` full screen, translucent | 7.69 | **5.69** | 1.35× |
| `composite` full screen, backdrop blur | 22.24 | **19.07** | 1.17× |
| `composite` drag, translucent | 8.95 | **6.80** | 1.32× |
| `composite` drag, backdrop blur | 12.19 | **9.76** | 1.25× |

The 1.28× the tile is worth over a merely-bounded range, and the two refutations
below, were each measured as a single-family pair against its own baseline in
that same form, so they are self-consistent even though their absolute figures
are a per-family run's.

Two follow-on facts the measurement settled, both **measured and refuted**, so
a later change does not re-derive them:

- **The blur's window arithmetic does not vectorise, and restructuring it for
  lanes buys nothing.** `Sum`'s four channels were rewritten as a `[u32; 4]`
  with the divisor decision hoisted off the per-channel path — the shape a
  packed `uqadd`/`uqsub` would need. `box_blur` did not move (11.29 → 11.28
  ns/px at r12), and the emitted code carries **no** vector register on either
  the host *or* `aarch64-unknown-none`: the `u32`→`u64` reciprocal multiply per
  channel is what neither NEON nor SSE2 has an instruction for. Reverted rather
  than kept as complexity a measurement does not support. A packed blur is F.2
  intrinsics work, not an F.1 source shape.
- **`resample`'s cost is the `i64` multiply-accumulate, not its divisions.**
  An opaque fast path naming the constant divisor (the `factor == 255` idiom)
  moved `1920x1080 -> 1280x800` from 19.45 to 18.96 ns/px — inside the noise
  for a megapixel case — so the three variable divides are not the bottleneck.
  The accumulators genuinely need 64 bits (four cubic taps of `weight × alpha ×
  channel` overflow `i32`), and neither NEON nor SSE2 has a 64-bit multiply, so
  no source shape makes this pass vectorise. Narrowing the weight scale would
  change the output and is therefore a rendering decision (invariant 2), not an
  optimisation. Reverted.

**Also fixed here** (§2.18, noticed by reading): `lib/display`'s three
per-pixel channel-order codecs (`encode`, `encode_straight`, `decode_straight`)
had the same missing `#[inline]`, and the disassembly confirms Stage J's
window-frame codec was making an out-of-line indirect call per pixel across its
own crate's module boundary — on the path every application present takes.
Fixed the same way; unmeasured, because no bench family covers the window-frame
codec, and the fix is the correct expression for a four-byte shuffle rather than
a restructure a figure would have to justify.

Also, and separately: the `encode` bench family
re-implemented the encode loop inside the harness instead of calling
`ChannelOrder::encode_run`, against A.2's own rule that a family measures the
production entry point. It now calls `encode_run`, which reports **0.031**
ns/px for the matching channel order (LLVM lowers it to a bulk copy on its own,
exactly as B.3's rustdoc predicted "would buy nothing") and 0.132 for the
shuffled one — against the 0.92 the harness was attributing to it. F.3's item 5
is therefore **closed with nothing to do**.

### F.2 Candidates, following `lib/pagezero` exactly
Same shape, because it has passed review once: a `build.rs`-emitted per-ISA cfg
(never `cfg(target_arch)` in source, so `cargo xtask cfg-check` stays green), a
portable baseline registered **last** that is always feature-legal, the mandatory
self-verify against that baseline over a fixed size/alignment/alpha vector,
`ByPriority` selection, host fuzzing, and the pin for determinism.

### F.3 Families, in order
1. `blend_span` — one source over a span (the one span composite B.6 routed
   every blended pixel through). **F.1 landed its source shape**; a packed
   candidate is still open.
2. `Surface::blit` — src-over-dst row zip. Reaches `blend_span`, so F.1
   covered it.
3. the WM's opaque/blended run loop (B.1). Its copy-and-encode half is now
   0.50 ns/px full screen; what is left is the strided alpha scan in
   `WindowRow::opaque_run`/`blend_len`.
4. `blur_span` add/sub/mean — after the D.3 reciprocal. F.1
   established this needs intrinsics: no source shape vectorises the
   reciprocal multiply.
5. `encode_run` is not a family: F.1 measured its byte-order shuffle at
   0.132 ns/px against 0.031 for the matching order, leaving a candidate
   nothing to win.
6. `resample` `filter_row`/`write_row` — icon and wallpaper scaling. F.1
   established the `i64` accumulator forbids vectorisation on both ISAs; a
   narrower one would change the output and is a User decision.

All are secret-free and bit-identical, so all are legal on the capability axis
(`plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md` invariant 8). None may be benchmark-selected.

### F.4 What is actually available per target

| Target | User-space vector state | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `aarch64` | full `q0`–`q31` + `FPCR`/`FPSR` saved on user trap entry/exit; `d8`–`d15` in the kernel switch | **Green today.** NEON candidates are a pure userland change. |
| `x86_64` | `xmm0`–`xmm15` + `MXCSR` framed on every entry; x87, the YMM/ZMM upper halves and the AVX-512 opmask saved per task at park | **Green.** SSE2 candidates are a pure userland change; AVX/AVX2 ones run in user space only, as the kernel's own dispatch is never offered them. |
| `riscv64` | scalar `f0`–`f31`/`fcsr` switched per task (D37); no vector state, so every task runs with `VS` off and `V` is not offered (D364) | **Green for scalar float.** Vector candidates need G.2. |
| `wasm32` | `simd128` not in the baseline | Baseline only. |

### F.5 Tests + docs
- Self-verify vectors per family (sizes, alignments, alpha extremes,
  overlapping/short spans).
- Differential fuzz: candidate vs baseline over random buffers
  (`cargo xtask fuzz`), added to the regression corpus (§19.6).
- The pin makes CI deterministic; the audit records the selection.
- Docs: `lib/raster/README.md` (families and their gates),
  `plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md` P3b corrected, README support matrix.

**Acceptance:** bit-identical output on every candidate, baseline chosen when
features are masked off, measured improvement quoted from the A.2 harness.

## Stage G — User-space vector/float enablement

x86_64 kernel and user space build for the first-party hard-float
`x86_64-tairix-none` (`.cargo/`), with the SSE2 baseline. The kernel writes only
`xmm0`–`xmm15`'s low halves and `MXCSR`, which every entry stub frames and
replaces with the kernel's own; the rest of the state — x87/MMX, the YMM and
ZMM upper halves, the AVX-512 opmask — is saved per task at park and loaded on
the way back to ring 3, so a switch to a kernel thread costs nothing. `XCR0`
enables AVX, and AVX-512 when present, so user space may dispatch on them
(`docs/src/architecture/multitasking.md`, `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D359).
riscv64 scalar state is D37's, and the kernel computes in floating point on
every port.

### G.2 riscv64 vector state
The port switches no `V` state, so every task runs with `VS` off
and `V` is not offered (D364). Enabling it means per-task lazy `VS` state
beside `FS` — the register file sized by `vlenb`, `vtype`/`vl`/`vstart`/`vcsr`
— with a QEMU witness under a `v=true` CPU, before any vector candidate.

### G.3 aarch64 SVE state
The port switches the NEON file only, and leaves SVE trapped (`CPACR_EL1.ZEN`),
so no task is offered it. Enabling it means per-task lazy `Z0`–`Z31`,
`P0`–`P15` and `FFR`, sized by the vector length `ZCR_EL1` grants, with the
NEON halves they alias kept coherent — and a QEMU witness under an SVE-capable
`-cpu max` — before any SVE candidate.

## Stage H — The kernel cost of a popup window

Not a compositor stage, and recorded here because this is where a reader chasing
"opening a menu is slow" arrives: the cost was **below** every stage above it,
which is why a menu drawn inside a window was instant while the same menu in its
own window was not.

`terminal.app` is the only app whose menus are separate **popup windows**
(`files.app`, the pinboard and the switchboard draw theirs into their own
surface), so it alone pays `shm_create` + `shm_grant` in the app and `shm_map` in
the session per open, and an unmap on each side per close. **Every one of those
syscalls re-froze the caller's entire address-space snapshot** — a page-table
walk plus a fresh heap node per resident page (`plans/FIX-KHEAP.md`) — over the
largest address space on the machine, inside non-preemptible syscalls. It is
invisible at QEMU screen sizes because the session's resident set is a fraction
of a 1080p one.

Every path that knows *which* pages it changed now publishes exactly those,
through one pair in `kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`: `publish_region_mapping`
(reads each page's resolved mapping from the live space) and
`publish_region_teardown` (removes them unconditionally — a re-freeze is a no-op
on a CPU with no published live space, which would leave freed pages
translating). Both fall back to the wholesale re-freeze only when a snapshot
cannot absorb a delta, so the delta is a cost reduction and never a correctness
dependency. `sharedreg::unmap`, `DmaPool::free_at`, `LiveUserSpace::free_dma` and
`DmaAllocFacility::free` report the byte extent they released. The same defect on
the **file-backed fault** path (a whole re-freeze per faulted page, making an
N-page mapping O(N²) to read) and on the stack-growth walk is fixed with it. Only
two callers re-freeze now, both compressed-tier batches that move several pages
at once and report no list: the ramzip warm/cluster restore and the
direct-reclaim compress-out sweep. Detail: `docs/src/architecture/memory.md`.

**What this does not close:** an app-owned popup window still costs the app's
own repaint and the session's decode of it. C.3 makes both cost the rectangle a
round reported rather than the window, but a *newly opened* popup has no prior
frame to differ from and so always costs its whole surface. Moving menus out of
apps altogether is `plans/NEW-MENUS.md`, an architectural change rather than a
performance one now that this is fixed.

---

## Stage I — Compose on every core the machine has

The rows of a dirty rectangle are independent by construction — each writes one
back-buffer row and the scan-out bytes of that row, and reads only immutable
window content — so they are composed in bands across a worker pool, and a
frost's column pieces with them. `lib/parallel` is the engine: the `JobRunner`
contract a pass expresses its independent work through, the one
index-to-element erasure, the one split policy, and the fork-join pool over
`lib/rt` threads whose workers park on a futex and never spin. Detail:
`docs/src/lib/parallel.md`.

- **Where it is installed.** `Compositor::set_job_runner`; the default composes
  on the calling thread, which is what a single-CPU machine, a headless build,
  and a process the kernel would grant no thread all keep. The session sizes the
  pool from the online CPU count it reads through the System Information API —
  never a constant — and states on `stderr` when it was granted fewer threads
  than the machine has cores.
- **A dispatch costs its work, never the scheduler's queue.** The pool's
  fork-join barrier is over the pieces of a dispatch still *in flight*, and a
  worker's hold on the dispatch is taken by the same atomic that hands it a
  piece — so a worker with no work holds nothing and is never waited for. This
  took two attempts, and the first is worth recording because the report that
  caught it looked identical both times. Waiting for every worker to be
  scheduled at least once, even when the dispatching thread had already claimed
  every piece, cost a measured 429 ms of compositing on a four-core Pi 4B,
  reported against the `desktop` surface as `blocked_in=futex_wait` with four
  syscalls in the span. Narrowing the barrier to the workers that had
  *registered* did not fix it — a worker is woken by every dispatch, so it does
  reach a CPU, take its hold, and then risk preemption with or without work —
  and the same report came back at 992 ms. Only taking the hold with the piece
  removes the case. It is why a *drag* paused while a hover did not: a hover's
  rectangle is under `MIN_PARALLEL_BAND_PX` so `bands` answers one and
  `compose_span` never dispatches, while a drag promotes the whole moved frosted
  window and does.
- **A teardown must not storm the machine either.** The same drag pause had a
  second contributor in the same log: a switchboard frame making 4254
  `mem_unmap` calls as a closing panel's ~18 MiB of live heap went away, each
  one taking the *global* address-space registry's write lock and shooting down
  the TLB on every other CPU. The userland heap's retention could not prevent
  it — a retention is a level, and a level slides down with the free span it
  bounds — so the arena moves in a granule (`lib/rt/README.md`). That bounded a
  *successful* teardown; the calls in that log were being **refused** and
  re-asked on every free, which is `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D114. With both
  closed, a process's own teardown can no longer serialise every other
  process's frame.
- **Bit-identity, not near-identity.** Each scene is composed twice — once
  whole, once split into bands that run backwards — comparing the scan-out
  frame, the back buffer, and every counted pixel of `FrameStats`; the frost
  does the same over rectangles, radii, coverages and random kept blocks. Each
  band tallies its own work and folds it in once, so a split frame reports
  exactly what a whole one does.
- **What splitting costs.** A rectangle below one band's pixel budget is composed
  on the calling thread with no atomics, so a pointer-motion repaint pays what it
  always did. A frost asks for exactly one piece per participant rather than
  several, because each piece re-primes its sliding window at its own first
  column.
- **Verticals.** The `parallel` role of `threads_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}`
  runs a divided pass through a real multi-worker pool many times over, compares
  every round against the same pass on one thread, dispatches before the workers
  can have reached their loop, allocates on workers inside a nested dispatch, and
  drops the pool to join them.
- **Two related invariants this established** (§2.18): the `lib/rt` global
  allocator takes the runtime's futex `Mutex`, never a spin lock — two threads
  allocating at once would otherwise burn a slice spinning through a critical
  section that maps pages, and on one core without preemption could not progress
  at all. And `Pool::with_workers` waits for every worker to read its starting
  epoch before returning, without which a worker that had not run yet would read
  an already-bumped epoch and park without acknowledging the dispatch.

`lib/controls`' selection frost stays on the calling thread, which is right for a
small rounded plate. Stage F's per-pixel kernels are orthogonal and compose with
the pool.

---

## Stage J — The one whole-window pass above the compositor

Converting an application's presented straight-alpha frame into the compositor's
own window surface, and reporting the pixels that genuinely changed, is not the
app's to shrink: the **app** declares the damage, so a client that repaints
everything makes the desktop convert everything. C.3 is the answer for the two
passes inside the app; it cannot be the answer for this one.

- **One definition, not seven.** The conversion is `tairix_display::winframe`,
  beside the `ChannelOrder` the scan-out path owns: `encode` writes a surface out
  as the straight-alpha bytes a window frame holds, `decode` reads a frame in and
  answers the changed sub-rectangle. The scan-out encoder is deliberately *not*
  reused — the screen is opaque, a window frame is not — so the pair sits beside
  it as `encode_straight` / `decode_straight`.
- **Spread, because it cannot be bounded.** Both directions are row-independent
  and expressed over `lib/parallel`'s `JobRunner`. The session hands the decode
  the compositor's own runner, read back through `Compositor::job_runner`, so the
  conversion and the composite cannot disagree about how wide the machine is. An
  app passes the calling-thread runner: it decides how much it presents, and a
  pool per app would be threads and stacks spent on a pass C.3 removes.
- **Bit-identity under splitting** is proven against `tairix_parallel::Reversed`,
  the one shared order-shuffling runner, so the `unsafe impl` lives once beside
  the trait whose obligations it discharges.
- **Fail closed.** Every index either direction uses is validated before the
  first write — more strictly than the hand-rolled loops were, since a row span
  wider than the stride is refused rather than relied on — so a hostile geometry
  refuses the whole conversion rather than leaving a window half-converted.

---

## What this plan refuses

Stated so a later change cannot quietly take a shortcut:

- **No SIMD before the algorithm.** Stage F may not land before B and C.
- **No performance claim without a number** from Stage A, and never a number
  taken from a dev-profile image — nor from a small case at the harness's default
  budget (A.2).
- **No second blend, raster, or region implementation** "for speed" (§2.2). One
  path, specialised loops.
- **No raising a constant instead of fixing the algorithm** (§2.17) — a bigger
  cache, more frame buffers, or a larger present limit is not a fix.
- **No disabling `overflow-checks`** (§2.9, §2.17). Hoist the arithmetic.
- **No output change without a decision** (invariant 2): approximate blends,
  half-resolution blur, or altered rounding are User decisions with visual
  evidence.
- **No wall-clock threshold as a CI gate** (§7): counters only.
- **No unbounded cache** (§24.1, §26.3): every cache is a reclaim client.

## Stage dependencies

| Stage | Content | Depends on | Touches ABI? | Touches kernel? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | build profile, bench harness, frame counters | — | no | no |
| B | opaque runs (occlusion is the same mechanism), dither, segment composite, `encode_run` | A | no | no |
| C | region hoist, control damage, hover routing, per-app damage, text memo, batch shell work | A | no | no |
| D | damage funnels, frost cache/reuse, blur reciprocal, family restack, desktop cells | A, B | no | no |
| E | disjoint region, one present per frame, one-shot pacing | B, C, D | `Present` rect list (with FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION Stage B) | no |
| F | `lib/cpuops` `ByPriority` raster candidates (aarch64 and x86_64) | B, C, (D, E) | no | no |
| G | x86_64 hard-float and per-task FP/SSE/AVX state; G.2 riscv64 vector state | — | target spec | yes |
| H | publish a region's own pages instead of re-freezing the space | — | no | yes |
| I | compose a dirty rectangle's rows in bands across a worker pool | A, B, D | no | no |
| J | one window-frame codec, and the desktop's decode spread across it | A, I | no | no |

A–E are expected to dominate F entirely.

## Decisions required (§15.7)

1. **Half-resolution blur (D.5)** is approved, conditional on the visual
   comparison being produced and judged first (invariant 2).
2. **A narrower `resample` accumulator** would change the output (F.3 item 6),
   so no `resample` candidate lands without a decision on it.
3. **G.2 and G.3**: whether, and when, to take riscv64 vector state and aarch64
   SVE state.

---

## Definition of done (whole plan)

- Every stage's code, tests, and docs land together (§7, §13); no stage ships a
  stub, a no-op, or a "later" (§2.19).
- Output is byte-identical to the pre-change reference for every scene
  (invariant 2), proven by the golden-frame tests, except where a User decision
  above explicitly approved a rendering change.
- The QEMU desktop verticals assert work counters, not timings, and the counters
  for hover, drag, blur, and idle are at or below the bounds each stage set.
- Every cache added is a bounded `lib/reclaim` client with an epoch and a
  pressure path (§24.1, §26.3).
- §23 self-review applied: security (client damage rects validated and clipped,
  no ambient authority, no new capability), correctness and multi-arch (no
  `cfg(target_arch)` outside the allow-list, no arch-only copy of shared logic),
  no-compat/no-dead-code (the WM's private `DamageRegion`, `compose_pixel`,
  `DesktopOutcome::redraw` and `keep_popups_stacked` are **deleted**, not left
  beside their replacements), tests/docs.
- Whole-project gate green: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo xtask ci` (once),
  `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5` (the run/encode/region/candidate decoders get
  harnesses, §19.6), and `tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20`.
