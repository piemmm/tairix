# ICONS.md — the desktop's icon artwork, end to end

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This plan owns one cross-cutting concern: **how a
thing on screen acquires the picture that represents it** — the shipped
artwork, the vocabulary that names it, the content-type registry that chooses
it, the build step that plants it, the runtime path that decodes it safely,
and every surface that draws it.

It exists because the answer spans crates that no single other plan owns: the
taskbar (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md`), the file manager
(`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md`), the desktop session (`plans/DISPLAY.md`), and
the shared controls (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`). Those plans own their
*surfaces*; this one owns the artwork pipeline they all draw through, so the
rule is stated once and cannot drift.

Read first: `AGENTS.md` §10 (the three-tier asset rule), §16.2
(`/System/Graphics`), §19.5 (parser sandboxing), §24.4 (fixed validation
bounds), and `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`.

## 0. The binding decisions

- **Tiers, always total.** A *thing* resolves to its own icon first — an
  application bundle's `Resources/` master, named by its signed manifest —
  and then to its *class*: raster artwork
  (`/System/Graphics/Icons/<asset-id>.png`), else the on-disk vector asset
  (`<asset-id>.svg`), else the first-party built-in glyph. The glyph tier is
  mandatory: no icon may exist as an asset alone, so a missing, oversize,
  corrupt, or refused file degrades to a meaningful picture and can never
  blank a surface. The charter carries this rule; this plan implements it.
- **The order is decided in exactly one place.** `ArtworkCache::artwork`
  takes one `IconRequest` (a kind alone, a kind plus an already-resolved
  asset path, or a kind plus a bundle directory) and owns the tier order, so
  a taskbar button, a launcher row, a desktop icon and a file-manager tile
  cannot resolve the same thing three different ways. The last tier is the
  kind's built-in picture (`builtin_picture`): its glyph's coverage mask, or
  for a settings category or pane its colour badge (I13).
- **Every tier is retained, the glyph included, so no frame resolves coverage
  twice.** A glyph is cached as an *untinted coverage mask* keyed
  `(kind, side)` — the shape does not depend on the colour it is drawn in, so
  one mask serves every tint and control state, and the drawing control
  composites it with `Surface::blit_tinted`. A settings badge is retained
  the same way, ready-coloured. Resolving a multi-layer glyph
  means painting its layers enlarged and averaging them back down to remove
  the seams between them, which measured 20–38 µs per icon: paid per icon per
  frame that is what made a long listing crawl, and paid once it is free
  thereafter. The mask is resolved *in this process*, not through the
  `ArtworkResolver`, because first-party vector art compiled into the binary
  needs neither a read nor a sandbox — and that also keeps it synchronous, so a
  glyph is on screen in the first frame that asks for it.
- **The draw path blits and never rasterises.** `IconArtwork::artwork` is
  total: it always answers, with shipped artwork or a glyph mask, tagged as
  `IconPicture` so the control knows which to tint. The one uncached path — a
  caller holding `NoArtwork`, a headless build or a test — draws through the
  same mask-and-tint arithmetic, so a cached icon and an uncached one are the
  same pixels.
- **A bundle's own icon is its identity, not a launcher detail.** The
  manifest's `library-icon` is independent of its `library` listing: every
  command app declares an icon and none of them is listed in the program
  library. The two were coupled once; the coupling is gone. Declaring one is
  **mandatory** for every launchable app, a raster master by preference — that
  rule is `plans/APPS.md` §14 and this plan does not restate it.
- **One vocabulary.** `IconKind` (`lib/icon`) is the single closed icon
  vocabulary. A file-class kind and a chrome glyph are the same kind of
  thing to every draw site; the difference is only which tier resolves.
- **Two independent facts, never conflated.** `MediaType` (`lib/browse`)
  names *what a file is*; `MediaType::icon()` names *which picture
  represents it*. The first is one-to-one and must never shrink (it is the
  application-association vocabulary); the second is deliberately
  many-to-one. A subclass chain (`MediaType::parent`) keeps a generic
  declaration matching a specific file, exactly as shared-mime-info models
  it.
- **Every decode is sandboxed and bounded.** A system asset is treated
  exactly like a third-party bundle's own icon: read under a fixed byte
  bound (`MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES`), refused *before* decode when over it, decoded
  in a minimum-capability sandbox process, and accepted only when the reply
  is exactly the pixels requested. The desktop trusts validated pixels,
  never a file.
- **Decode once, per (thing, pixel side).** One reclaim-governed cache
  (`lib/icon::ArtworkCache`), shared by every consumer process, keyed by what
  was resolved (an asset path, or a bundle directory) and the pixel side,
  returning borrows so a hundred-tile grid never copies a hundred images per
  frame. Negative results are cached too, so a bad asset — or a bundle with
  no icon at all — is not re-read every frame.
- **Decoded once means once, not once per band.** The cache is the *working
  set* of the surfaces drawing from it, not speculation around one: re-deriving
  an entry costs a capability-gated read plus a sandbox round trip. So mild and
  moderate memory pressure take the scroll-back speculation but leave what one
  frame draws (`tairix_reclaim::working_set_ui_cache`, `plans/SMARTRAM.md`
  section 6.4); severe and critical take it down to the shared reserve, and the
  glyph tier is then the honest answer. A refusal the cache cannot avoid is reported to the resolver
  (`ArtworkResolver::declined`) and not re-offered until the band moves, so
  giving the pixels up is never a storm of reads that cannot be kept.
- **The ceiling is one screenful, because that bounds what a frame can draw.**
  Icons are drawn on the output, so no more of them can be visible at once than
  fill it. A *fraction* of one frame cannot hold them — a 480×480 file-manager
  window draws some 117 KiB of icon where a sixteenth of its frame is 57 KiB —
  and a cache that evicts an entry the next paint asks for again either shows a
  wrong picture or pays the read and the round trip per icon per frame. Only a
  quarter of that ceiling is the pressure-proof working set, though: the rest is
  scroll-back nothing is drawing, and it goes at the first tightening.
- **Rendered exactly, at the size it is drawn.** A vector asset is rasterised
  straight onto the requested `side`×`side` surface — never at a nominal size
  and rescaled — and every pixel takes the *exact* fraction of its own area
  the artwork covers (`lib/raster`'s scan converter). The layer stack is
  composed through `Surface::layered`, which paints a multi-layer icon larger
  and averages it down, because two anti-aliased edges that abut otherwise
  blend as if they overlapped and leave a shape's outline short of opaque.
  Both matter most exactly where icons live: a 256-unit drawing in twenty-odd
  pixels, with strokes a fraction of a pixel wide. Sampling a handful of
  points per pixel instead cost up to a third of full alpha on an edge and
  rendered a symmetric shape asymmetrically.
- **Artwork is data, discovered at build time.** The shipped set is whatever
  is in `lib/icon/assets/` and in each bundle's own `Resources/`; adding an
  icon is dropping a file there. No hand-maintained list exists in the
  kernel, the image builder, or a test fixture, and the build refuses a file
  the desktop could not resolve.

## 1. The shipped set

Two families of master, one contract.

**The class artwork** — `lib/icon/assets/<asset-id>.png` or
`<asset-id>.svg`, planted at `/System/Graphics/Icons/`. The file name *is*
the asset id, and the id *is* an `IconKind::asset_id()`, so a typo cannot
ship: `tools/syshelp`'s build script fails the build on an unrecognised name,
an oversize file, or a duplicate id. A kind ships **one** master, in whichever
format suits its artwork — the folders are vector (`folder.svg`,
`folder-filled.svg`), the
illustrative file-class and disk pictures are raster. Two files claiming one
id is a duplicate the build refuses: the raster tier would always win, so the
vector could never be selected.

**Each bundle's own icon** — `<crate>/Resources/<name>.png` (the preferred
form) or `<name>.svg`, declared as `library-icon` in that bundle's
`AppInfo.toml` and planted inside the bundle. Every command app and every GUI
app under the three app roots the resource walk covers (`userland/apps`,
`userland/shell`, `userland/gui`) carries one, so browsing the system program
stores shows fifty distinct pictures rather than fifty copies of the generic
bundle icon.
Services outside those roots keep the service-bundle class artwork, which is
the honest picture for them.

A **raster** master is square, straight-alpha
and at least `MIN_ARTWORK_SIDE` (256×256), so a slot only ever downscales it.
It also carries **no transparent margin**: a master is trimmed to its artwork
— rows and columns whose every pixel is below a perceptible alpha are padding,
not drawing — and then padded back to a square only as far as the artwork's
own aspect requires, centred. A slot reserves its own clearance
(`icon_content_side`), so margin baked into the master is spent twice and the
icon reads smaller than every other one beside it. The image build refuses an
untrimmed master: its drawn content must reach within a pixel of both edges on
its longer axis and sit centred, to a pixel, on the shorter one.
A **vector** master has no pixel side at all: the decoder requires its design
box to be square and the desktop rasterises it at the side it is about to
draw. Either form stays within `MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES` (256 KiB), and both are
*authored artwork*: adding or replacing one is dropping the file on disk, never
editing a list. The image build proves every one of them is artwork the desktop
will really draw (below), so "the icon is broken" is a build failure rather
than a silent glyph on someone's desktop.

Masters that no live consumer can select are **not** shipped. They live in
`artwork/` (reference art, not shipped) and return to `lib/icon/assets/` in
the change that gives them a consumer — `artwork/icons/disk-floppy.png` is
the current example: nothing in the block stack can report a floppy medium,
so shipping it would be a picture nothing could ever choose.

## 2. I1 — the vocabulary and the artwork layer (`lib/icon`)

- `IconKind` covers chrome, application/service bundles, the file classes,
  and the drive media. A fine-grained kind (`text-x-rust`, `image-png`)
  deliberately shares its family's built-in glyph, so the glyph tier stays
  meaningful without hand-authoring an outline per file type.
- `artwork.rs` owns the whole runtime path: `GRAPHICS_DIR` / `ICONS_DIR`,
  `icon_artwork_path` / `icon_vector_path`, `artwork_kind_for_file` (the
  build's fail-closed name check), the `MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES` bound (one
  definition, `lib/sandbox` consumes it), the `ArtworkReader` /
  `ArtworkRasteriser` seams, the `IconArtwork` draw-site lookup with its
  all-glyph `NoArtwork` implementation, `ArtworkCache`, and
  `IconArtworkSource` which binds a cache to its seams.
- `disk_icon(Option<BlkDeviceClass>)` maps a mounted volume's real storage
  medium to its icon, with paravirtual and unknown both resolving to the
  generic drive glyph — the honest answer, not a guess.

## 3. I2 — the content-type registry (`lib/browse`)

One closed `MediaType` registry replaces the two overlapping
extension-keyed tables that used to exist (a four-class icon classifier and
a separate association table). It provides the media-type spelling, the
reverse lookup, the icon, the subclass parent, and the entry classifier
(which distinguishes an application bundle from a service bundle by the
store it was listed from). Association matching walks the subclass chain and
ranks a specific declaration ahead of a generic one.

## 4. I3 — build-time discovery and planting

`tools/syshelp` walks `lib/icon/assets/` and emits `GRAPHICS_FILES`
alongside the existing per-bundle `Help/` and `Resources/` tables. The
image builder and the QEMU encrypted-root fixture both author `/System`
through `tairix_syshelp::build_system_volume`, which counts and plants the
one file set. A read-back test mounts the built `/System` read-only and
proves the bytes arrive intact.

The same stage closed a live defect: a bundle could declare a
`library-icon` larger than the desktop will ever decode, and would then
silently render as a glyph forever with nothing telling the author. The
image build now refuses it, naming the bundle, the file, its size, and the
bound — and, since I7, refuses any icon that is not artwork the desktop could
draw at all: the format is decided from the bytes as the runtime decides it, a
raster master must be square, at least the master side, and trimmed, and
either form must actually draw something.

## 5. I4 — the taskbar and the program library

The bar's two permanent launchers draw their shipped artwork; a pin and a
running-task item use the application's own icon, then its kind's artwork, then
the glyph — one rule, expressed once. The trailing account capsule takes the
first rung of that same rule with the account's own circular identity disc
(`tairix_icon::monogram_disc`, shared with the login screen), so no shipped
class picture ever stands in for a person.
The program-library popup shows
each application's own icon, resolved only for the rows actually on screen
and re-resolved on scroll. The session owns the one `ArtworkCache` and its
seams; the taskbar renders and never reads a file.

A latent bring-up defect was fixed here: the shared cache admits nothing
while the reported memory-pressure band is the fail-closed unknown, and the
session refreshed its band only *after* building its caches — so artwork and
glyph caches would have stayed cold through bring-up.

## 6. I5 — the file manager

The grid (icon) view draws file-class artwork through the same shared cache,
decoding in a sandbox the app hosts itself under the spawn authority it
already held — no new capability, and no in-process decode. Decoding is
strictly demand-driven: only visible tiles, only newly visible kinds on
scroll, released on teardown and trimmed when pressure deepens (driven by
the same kernel pressure wake the session uses, never a timer).

Every other icon the window draws resolves through that same cache too: the
**list** view's row icons, the toolbar's tools, and the places rail's rows. The
list asks by *class* rather than naming a bundle — a row-height picture cannot
show one application apart from another, and reading each bundle's manifest to
find out would be per-bundle I/O the reader never sees — while the grid, whose
tiles are large enough to tell two applications apart, names the bundle. Only
the rows and tools on screen are asked for.

## 7. I6 — storage media are real, not guessed

A volume's medium is threaded from the block device's own declaration
through the kernel mount table onto the ungated `MOUNT_LIST` record, so the
places sidebar's drive icons reflect what is actually attached. An
unrecognised class word stays an explicit *unknown* the whole way rather
than being rewritten into a fabricated "paravirtual" identity; the
cautious I/O budget for an unknown device is unchanged.

One residual gap this stage surfaced rather than buried is tracked in
`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`: a composition can still fold an unreadable member
class into a concrete class, so a composed volume may publish a medium
nobody declared. Its only user-visible consumer today is the drive icon,
where the generic glyph is already the right picture.

## 8. I7 — every app carries its own icon

The last stage closed the gap the tiers implied but nothing supplied: the
system shipped one picture for *all* applications. Now:

- Every command and GUI bundle ships its own icon in its `Resources/` and
  declares it in its manifest — mandatory for any new app (`plans/APPS.md`
  §14). The shipped set is one family of 256×256 illustrative raster masters,
  each a picture of what its program works on — the page a text tool reads,
  the folder a directory tool makes, the drive a storage tool inspects — in
  one material vocabulary (brushed aluminium, charcoal glass, paper, blue
  folders) lit from the upper left, with one orange accent and a round emblem
  for the action a tool performs (add, remove, edit, eject, information). A
  strip of them reads as one system and each tool's function reads at a
  glance. Cinder's is the deliberate exception: the mascot is an anime-style
  character portrait.
- `AppInfoHeader` no longer refuses an icon on an unlisted bundle. That rule
  made sense when the program library was the only consumer; the file manager
  and the desktop are consumers too, and neither has anything to do with the
  launcher's folders.
- The file manager's grid and the desktop's icons name the bundle in their
  request, so a `.app` tile draws the application's own picture. Resolution
  stays demand-driven (only the tiles on screen), and a bundle is keyed in
  the cache by its *directory*, so its manifest is read once and a bundle
  with no icon of its own remembers that too.
- The image build proves every icon it is about to plant — class artwork and
  bundle icon alike — is artwork the desktop will draw, deciding the format
  from the bytes exactly as the runtime does: a PNG through `lib/image` under
  the same limits the sandboxed rasteriser applies, else the supported SVG
  subset through `lib/svg`. A raster master must be square, at least
  `MIN_ARTWORK_SIDE`, and trimmed (§1), and either form must draw something —
  an empty document or a wholly transparent master would ship as an invisible
  icon.
- A bundle's manifest is untrusted at that boundary: the icon name is
  accepted only as a plain file name and resolved *inside* the bundle's own
  directory, so a hostile `library-icon` cannot aim the desktop at a file
  elsewhere. It draws its class picture instead.
- **Artwork must read against the ground it is drawn on, and only the author
  can decide that.** The build proves an icon decodes and draws something; it
  says nothing about whether the result is *visible*, and `sapper`'s first
  palette was navy throughout — its tile 1.33:1 against the dark theme's raised
  surface, which is what the icon bar draws a slot on — so the icon vanished
  into the bar while passing every check. The minefield and the winter scene
  are the two masters whose natural palettes sink into a dark bar, so tests
  beside the build's own icon sweep measure the shipped PNGs: most of each
  one's solidly drawn area stands WCAG 2.1's non-text 3:1 clear of the dark
  raised surface, so re-darkening either is no longer a quiet edit.

  Deliberately **not** a build-time contrast gate over the whole set. The
  paper-white document masters read on the light ground by their outline and
  shadow rather than by area: any whole-area threshold strong enough to catch a
  navy tile refuses them. A heuristic that refuses good icons to catch a bad
  one is worse than the author's eye (§2.3).

## 9. I8 — the pressure vertical photographs the band it asserts over

`tairix-test-desktop-pressure-qemu-aarch64` requires the icon bar's untouched
slot to be **byte-identical** between its two frames, reading any drift as "the
desktop stopped drawing its decoded artwork". Section 0's policy keeps the
cache through mild and moderate and **does** take it at severe and critical,
where the glyph tier is the honest answer — so the assertion is a true
statement about the shallower bands alone.

It used to be a fixed spend (thirty-two windows) at a relative target, which
overshot: measured runs reached severe some seventeen seconds *before* the
photograph, and the assertion was scoped out of exactly the runs whose pixels
were interesting. Under eight concurrent QEMU guests it had measured 22.6% slot
drift against 0% alone.

The frame is now taken in the band it is judged against. The guest reports the
moment the published band first *leaves* normal
(`PRESSURE_LEFT_NORMAL_MARKER`, written straight to the serial sink because it
is emitted inside an audit callback where a log event would re-enter the sink
that called it), the host photographs there, and two further windows finish the
run. A window costs some 2.6 MiB against watermarks a tenth of the board apart,
so the first reading above normal is mild — and the zero-drift bound therefore
applies on **every** run rather than being relaxed on the deep ones. There is
no scope-out left to read a transcript for.

**Both frames are photographed in the state the bound is about.** A
byte-identity claim over a slot needs the slot's *settled* picture in the
baseline too, and the desktop's reveal witness supplies neither half of that:
the slot's application is a separate process whose bring-up is unordered
against the fade, and the bundle's icon is decoded off the serve loop and
lands a frame or two behind the slot that asked for it. So the baseline is
gated on the bar's own `APP_BAR_SETTLED` — a revealed frame carrying the strip
with no slot still waiting on a decode — which the session can state because
it holds all three facts. `AppBarService::slots` learns the last of them from
`ArtworkOutcome`, so a bundle shipping no drawable icon settles on its glyph
instead of holding the witness back for ever. The vertical's launch gesture
waits on the same witness, so the runner's unverified-dump hold puts the
baseline on disk before any click can change the screen it read
(`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D138).

## 10. I9 — one surface still rasterises its glyphs per frame

The glyph tier is cached and the draw path blits, but a control only benefits
where its owner holds a cache to resolve through. One surface holds none, so
its `paint_icon_slot` calls still take the inline path and re-resolve coverage
every frame:

- **The widgets gallery** (`userland/apps/widgets`) is a demo of the control
  family; it draws each control once per frame with `NoArtwork` deliberately,
  and is not a surface a user scrolls. It needs a cache only if the gallery is
  ever meant to demonstrate the cached path.

The Switchboard now holds one (`userland/gui/switchboard/src/run.rs`), built
through the shared `artwork_cache` constructor with its own label, the primary
seat, its window's frame bytes, `tairix_rt::pressure::gauge()` and the crate's
own log sink, trimmed on the memory-pressure wake like every other cache on the
desktop. That closes the per-frame rasterisation for this surface: the glyph
tier is resolved *in this process* and retained like any other entry, so the
20–38 µs of coverage work is paid once per (kind, side) rather than per icon
per frame.

**Its resolver serves, and the narrow spawn capability is what makes that
safe.** Reading a bundle's own icon needs `CAP_FS_ACCESS`; decoding those
untrusted bytes needs a sandbox child, and the capability for *that* is
`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`, not `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`. The narrow one admits exactly one
shape of child — the kernel-branded, capability-empty parser worker
(`SpawnMode::ParserSandbox`) — so a process may decode a hostile file without
gaining the authority to start anything else. That distinction is the whole
answer to the objection this plan used to record: the Switchboard holds the
system-wide process scope, task control and the machine's power authority, and
a malformed PNG must never be decoded beside them — but it never is, because
the decode does not happen in this process at all. The greeter holds the same
pair for the same reason. Real reach stays per-inode, so the service reads only
what the launching user could read, and an account whose ceiling withholds
`CAP_FS_ACCESS` falls back to the glyphs.

Granting it needed one thing beyond the manifest: the effective set is
`ceiling ∩ manifest`, and `SESSION_BASELINE` held `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` but not
`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`, so a manifest asking for the narrow authority intersected
to nothing. The baseline now lists it — which grants an interactive account
nothing new, since the spawn gate already accepts `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` for a parser
child, and is what lets a program of that account ask for the narrow authority
instead of general spawn.

The read and the sandbox round trip run on a worker thread over the shared
`ArtworkDesk`, never on the loop that owes the window a frame: a paint records
what it missed and draws the glyph, and the worker's wake — a permanent member
of the loop's wait-set — brings the pixels. One wake per drained batch, so a
table of fifty rows costs one repaint rather than fifty; the desk owns that
rule, so the file manager and the Switchboard cannot diverge on it. The batch
*names* the decodes that came back (`Landed`), so a surface that stores its
pictures repaints the items the batch moved and a whole table does not
recompose because one row's icon arrived.

The *request* names the bundle, so the resolution order is correct end to end:
the desktop session reports which bundle it launched each window owner from
(`SwitchboardCommand::OwnerBundle`) and each row asks for that bundle's own
icon first. Only a window owner has a bundle, so a process nothing attests —
PID 1, a time service, a kernel thread — draws the executable glyph, which is
the distinction `01-tasks.png` shows between them. Matching a process *name*
against a bundle would be guessing and is not done.

**The lookup is passed to the render methods, not carried on `SectionCtx`.**
This plan said "through `SectionCtx`", which turned out not to fit: that
context is `Copy` and is passed *by value* to `render`, `on_pointer`, `adopt`
and the keyboard paths, and only the render paths need artwork. A
`&mut dyn IconArtwork` field would make it non-`Copy` and mutably borrowing
across every one of those call sites. It is therefore a parameter of `render`,
`render_band` and `render_overlay` — the pattern `lib/browse/src/render.rs` and
`lib/controls/src/toolbar.rs` already use.

Three controls also draw their glyph outside the shared icon slot, so they
resolve coverage per frame even when their owner *does* hold a cache: a
`Button`'s leading icon (`ButtonContent::Icon`/`IconLabel`), a `MenuItem`'s
row icon, and the greeter's continue mark. All three now draw through the one
`glyph_mask` + `Surface::blit_tinted` arithmetic every other icon uses — so no
two surfaces disagree about a glyph's pixels — but none of them takes a
picture, so none is cached. Giving them one means an artwork parameter on
`Button::render`, `Menu::render` and the greeter's row painter, which their
callers would have to thread.

None of this is a correctness defect — the pixels are identical either way,
which is the point of routing every path through the same arithmetic — and
none is on the file manager's hot path, which is what the caching tier was
added for. They are the remainder of "no surface rasterises on the draw
path".

## 11. I10 — two SVG class-asset decode paths

The crate now decodes a vector class asset in two places. `lib/icon/src/load.rs`
builds a whole `IconSet` up front, one slot per `IconKind`, from an injected
`IconAssetSource`; `ArtworkCache`'s vector tier decodes one asset per (asset,
pixel side) on demand, bounded and reclaim-governed. The single-decode-path
intent above wants one of them to own the class assets: the preloaded set is
the right shape for the always-resident chrome glyphs, the bounded cache for
artwork drawn at a slot's pixel side. Deciding which owns what is a design
question this plan has not settled.

## 12. I11 — an undrawable element is skipped, not refused

`lib/svg` decodes the shape, paint and compositing surface of SVG 1.1
(`plans/SVG.md`), so an authored master's artwork ships as its designer drew
it. What it does not draw **yet** — text, embedded images, filters, animation
— it **skips**, rendering the rest of the document rather than refusing it.
Those are staged items in that plan, not declined ones.

That is deliberate: one unsupported decoration should not lose a whole asset,
and it is the behaviour every surface has today. But it cuts against failing
closed, because a master carrying an element the decoder cannot honour
renders without it — a wrong picture — instead of falling back to the tier
below. The alternative is to refuse the document when it carries a drawable
element the decoder cannot honour, so a wrong picture becomes a clean
fallback. Which of the two the desktop wants is a decision this plan has not
taken; the build gate already refuses a master that draws nothing, so only
the *partially* drawable case is at stake.

The set at stake keeps shrinking as `plans/SVG.md` advances. Clipping,
masking, group opacity, `<pattern>` fills, `<marker>` decorations and
non-scaling strokes are all honoured — including a tile whose content spills
into the neighbouring repeats, which used to take the reference's fallback
colour and so was itself a wrong picture; a `clip-path` or `mask` naming
something the document does not define makes the element **not rendered**
rather than rendered unclipped, and a paint server that is defined but paints
nothing is `none` rather than the fallback colour written beside the
reference — which is this question already answered, for the cases where the
decoder can tell what the author meant.

What remains at stake is a master carrying text, an embedded image, a filter
or an animation, and **text is the case that matters most**: a decoration
skipped is a master drawn slightly plainer, where lettering skipped can leave
a master meaningless while still passing the build gate's "draws something"
check. That asymmetry is the strongest argument for answering per element
class rather than globally, and it resolves as those items land.

## 13. I12 — masters stop at 256 px while a slot can ask for 512

Every raster master is authored at `MIN_ARTWORK_SIDE` (256 px), but the
sandboxed rasteriser serves a slot up to `MAX_ICON_SIDE` (512 px), and at the
highest UI scales a large tile asks for more than 256 — the file manager's grid
passes it only beyond about 600%. There, and only there, a slot upscales, which
the charter's raster rule forbids. Authoring at 512 closes it, but costs about
four times the decode work per (asset, side) and brings the richest masters
near `MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES`, a fixed bound a master may not raise. Which to trade
is a decision this plan has not taken. High-resolution sources for the
terminal, Switchboard and program-library masters are in `plans/icons/`; the
other masters would be re-rendered or re-authored at the larger side.

## 14. I13 — a settings category or pane is a colour badge

A settings category is found by colour before its name is read, so its
built-in picture is a badge: its symbol in white on a rounded plate of the
category's hue (`lib/icon`'s `badge` module). Every row of the Settings
sidebar is one, so a pane a category discloses as a row of its own — About,
Login & startup, Caching, Date & Time, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, DNS, TCP/IP — has a
badge kind of its own too, never its category's borrowed.

- **A badge is chrome, and built in.** It is a silhouette in a fixed ink on a
  plate whose colour is data — a closed `BadgeHue` set, one hue per kin group
  — not a rendered picture, so it is vector art with no raster master. It is
  the kind's built-in tier, compiled in, which is also what lets Settings show
  it holding no read or decode authority.
- **A pane wears its subject's kin, not its category's.** Login & startup
  stands on the power group's green and Date & Time on the indigo of night and
  the hours, while the wired link and the protocol options keep the
  connections' blue — so the hue says what a row is about wherever it is
  listed. `Orange` joined the set for the one subject with no kin, the desktop
  theme.
- **Drawn at the exact side, never resampled.** The plate spans the slot, so
  its flat edges fall on pixel boundaries; a centred symmetric symbol renders
  mirror-symmetric at every side. The artefact this closed — the old 24-unit
  glyphs drawn at a fractional scale, one edge of a stroke solid and its mirror
  grey — is a host test over every side from 12 to 66 pixels.
- **One geometry path.** Symbols are SVG path data on a 24-unit grid, built
  through `lib/svg`'s one flattener and stroker and its `place` onto the
  design grid; nothing in `lib/icon` flattens a curve.
- **Legible on its own plate.** Every hue's midpoint stands the white symbol
  at least 3:1 clear, the non-text contrast floor, and a test holds each ramp
  to it.
- **The symbol is also the glyph.** `glyph_mask` of a category or pane — what
  a button or menu row draws in its own colour — is the symbol alone, never a
  tinted plate. A category never draws the tray reading it stands beside
  (`Network`, `Volume`, `Bell`) or the single thing it gathers (`User`,
  `Disk`), and the About pane's `i` in a ring is its own kind rather than the
  viewer's `Info` command.

## 15. What this plan deliberately does not cover

- **Cursors and window chrome stay vector.** They are tintable silhouettes
  resolved from the theme; a raster master would be the wrong source format
  for them and the charter says so.
- **Animated formats (GIF playback), JPEG, and ICO decoding.** A shipped
  raster master is PNG; the file-class artwork for a JPEG or GIF *file* is a
  static icon, which needs no decoder for that format. A decoder is added
  when something actually needs to display such a file's contents, in the
  plan that owns that viewer — never speculatively here.
