# NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md — A first-class, capability-scoped service manager

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This plan makes service lifecycle a single,
first-class subsystem of TAIRiX rather than the embryonic launcher that
lives inside PID 1 today plus a scatter of ad-hoc starts (the desktop /
`login` starting `fontd`). It **evolves the existing `init` model in
place** (§2.2, §2.13) — no parallel manager, no `v2`.

The manager is a vital OS component and a large part of the trusted
computing base, so it holds the *minimum* authority, validates every
request, and fails closed (§4, §5.4).

## 1. What exists today (evolve, do not greenfield)

PID 1 (`userland/system/init`) is already an embryonic service manager:

- `service.rs` — `ServiceSpec { name, binary_path, account, dependencies,
  readiness, requires, provides, activation, stop_grace, connect_capability }`
  and the `Spawner` / `Reaper` / `Stopper` seams (pure core, host-tested). The
  spec names the service **account** (a uid), not manifest bytes: the kernel
  derives the grant (SVC-A).
- `manager.rs` (`Init`) — dependency **topological ordering**, `register`,
  `start_all`, readiness-gated admission, `reap`, and audit emission.
  **The kernel is the single capability authority** (SVC-A): the manager
  names only a service's binary and its **service account** (`ServiceSpec`
  carries a `binary_path` + `account` uid, never manifest bytes), and the
  kernel derives `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` from the signed bundle at load
  time — exactly as `drvhost` does for drivers. The `Spawner` seam is
  therefore `spawn(spec) -> Pid` (path + account, no capability set), so no
  init-side capability derivation can drift from the kernel's authoritative
  one. `RunningService` tracks live PIDs.
- `supervisor.rs` — wait-any supervision with a **bounded per-entry
  crash-loop budget** (never `spawn`-in-a-loop, §2.1).
- `startup.rs` — the boot service set as a parsed, fail-closed
  `StartupConfig` (`DEFAULT_CONFIG`: `sysinfod`, `netstack`, `devmgr`,
  `seatmgr`, then `login` as the session), currently **compiled in**. Its
  `MAX_SERVICES` bound is **derived from the floor text** (`DEFAULT_CONFIG`'s
  own `service`-directive count), so it tracks the floor rather than a magic
  cap (SVC-1, done).
- `events.rs` — reserved audit event IDs in `9000..10000`
  (`SERVICE_STARTED/START_FAILED/SKIPPED/EXITED`, `UNTRACKED_CHILD_REAPED`,
  `GRAPH_REJECTED`, `SERVICE_READY/CONDITION_SATISFIED/NOTIFY_REJECTED`,
  `SERVICE_NOT_ENROLLED`).
- `lib/enrolment` — the fail-closed enrolment registry (SVC-3): `Enrolment`
  (the enabled-service-name set, built from the compiled-in list), the
  administrator's `EnrolmentOverride` document and its parser, strict
  `validate_service_name`, and the pure `enrol`/`unenrol` transforms, which
  decide eligibility only — the kernel's spawn-time grant is the authority.
  A crate of its own so an editor validates the override document with the
  parser `init` reads it with.

Two mechanisms already in the tree that this plan reuses rather than
reinvents (§2.2):

- **Discovery by scanning the store** — `enumerate_driver_store` /
  `SystemFileService::list_store` (`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/system_files.rs`)
  already walks `/System/Drivers/` and reads bundles fail-closed. Service
  discovery is the same walk over `/System/Services/`.
- **Pre-unlock `/System/Settings` reads** — `SystemFileService::read_system_config`
  + the closed `SystemConfigFile` ABI enum already read a *whitelisted* set
  of `/System/Settings/**` files off the always-mounted read-only `/System`
  before the encrypted root is unlocked. The service **registration store**
  (below) is read through this same confined, fail-closed path.

TAIRiX has not shipped, so `abi-v1` is **not** frozen: the new `lib/abi`
types below are added now and only freeze on first release (§2.13, §9).

---

## 2. Where service data lives — `/System/Settings`, not `/System/Security`

Per the issue, all service configuration and registration data lives under
**`/System/Settings`** (machine-wide) and **`/Users/<u>/Settings`**
(per-user), never under `/System/Security` (§5.1, §16.2, §16.3). Rationale:
`/System/Security` holds identity/keys/MAC policy; service *enrolment* is
system configuration, and `/System/Settings` is exactly the machine-wide
settings tree (§16.2), already the one writable-by-the-trusted-path,
`nosuid,nodev,noexec` location the kernel can read pre-unlock.

- System service registration store: `/System/Settings/Services/`.
- Per-user service registration store: `/Users/<u>/Settings/Services/`.

The **unit metadata itself** (restart policy, activation mode, linger,
dependencies, required readiness conditions, per-service rlimits) does **not**
live in `/System/Settings`: it lives in the service's **signed `AppInfo`
bundle manifest** (§16.5), so tampering is a load refusal (§9). The
registration store holds only *enrolment records* — a decision "this
discovered bundle is eligible to auto-start / be on-demand-activated" keyed
to the bundle, produced by trusted tooling or an explicit `enable` action.
It is never a hand-maintained second copy of the unit metadata (§2.2,
§18.5) and never a place a user can raise a system service's authority.

---

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Discovery vs registration vs activation (three distinct steps)

A service, unlike a driver, has no natural activation gate (a driver's is
"the hardware is physically present and matched", §18.3). Dropping a signed
bundle on disk must therefore **not** make a live service appear — that is
an ambient-authority-shaped risk. Three separated steps:

1. **Discovery** — what bundles exist: scan `/System/Services/*.app` (and,
   for user services, the user's bundles) and read each signed `AppInfo`.
   No compiled-in list of *which services exist* (§2.2, §18.5); only the
   irreducible boot floor stays compiled in (§18.6).
2. **Registration / enablement** — is a discovered service *eligible* to
   auto-start or be on-demand-activated. An explicit, recorded,
   integrity-protected decision in the registration store (§2), never
   implied by presence. This is the systemd *present-vs-enabled* split with
   the capability framing.
3. **Activation** — actually starting it: at boot (for `boot`-mode enabled
   services whose readiness conditions are met), on-demand (endpoint
   activation, §3.4), or by an explicit control request (§3.7).

Two enrolment channels, mapped onto trust domains:

- **System services** are enrolled by trusted tooling at **image-build /
  install time** (`tools/mkimage`, the §11 installer). Post-install
  additions flow through the **signed update path** (§11/§19.3) under
  `CAP_SYSTEM_UPDATE` — never a user writing the system registration store.
- **User services** are enrolled **manually** by the user via an explicit,
  capability-gated `enable` action into that user's **own** per-user scope,
  bounded by that user's ceiling (§5.1/§5.2). Enrolment records a decision;
  it can never grant authority the enroller lacks.

### 3.2 Two scopes, one engine

The system-vs-user boundary is realised as **one policy engine instantiated
at two authority scopes** (§2.2), never two codebases:

- **One system service manager** — PID 1's role. Holds system authority,
  minimal TCB (§4), runs system-scoped services under their own service
  accounts (`plans/USERS.md`), each in a session of its own
  (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`). The kernel reparents nothing: an
  orphan leaves no zombie and ends with its session, so PID 1 reaps only its
  own children. (A userland launcher-as-parent breaks reaping per
  `FIX-DESKTOP.md` §2.4, but a service manager *should* parent what it
  supervises, so that objection does not apply here.)
- **One per-user service manager instance per logged-in user** — spawned by
  the system manager at session start, delegated **only that user's
  sub-ceiling** (intersection, never widening, §5.2; no ambient authority,
  §4). It parents/supervises/reaps that user's own services; on logout it
  stops them (reverse-dependency order) and exits, and the kernel ends
  whatever they left running with its session.

Boundary invariants (a reviewer will hammer these):

- A user's on-demand request can **never** make a system-authority service
  appear, nor touch another user's services.
- A **shared sandboxed service like `fontd`** is **system-scoped** but
  usable by all users *because it is sandboxed to minimum capability*
  (§19.5) and exposes only a data endpoint. A user-triggered activation
  hands the *user* a **connection**, never any of the service's authority.
  The per-user manager does not own `fontd`; it routes the user's activation
  request to the system manager, which brokers the connection.

### 3.3 Service lifecycle + readiness protocol

The current model treats "spawned" as "done" — a correctness gap: a
dependent that needs "network up" cannot honestly start when `netstack` is
merely *spawned*. Add:

- An explicit lifecycle: `inactive → starting → ready → running → stopping →
  stopped | failed`.
- A **readiness notification** protocol (an `sd_notify` analogue) so a
  service declares "I am up" via a versioned `lib/abi` call, and
  dependents / readiness gates release only then.
- **Named readiness conditions / targets** (`network-up`,
  `filesystems-mounted`, `boot-complete`, `display-present`,
  `seat-available`, …). A service declares the conditions it requires; the
  manager releases it only when all are satisfied, and it runs only while
  they hold: a provided condition holds only while a provider is ready, and
  its withdrawal stops what requires it and holds it for re-admission.
  A condition is only ever satisfied by a principal that genuinely knows it,
  which is the whole of its value: `display-present` has no truthful producer
  today (`seatmgr` and `devmgr` both reach ready on a headless machine), so
  nothing declares it and nothing asserts it. The honest candidate is the
  display driver's bind of `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`, which no registered service
  observes yet.
  The headless case does **not** rest on a condition: a GUI-only service is
  `on-demand`, so a machine where nothing graphical runs never activates it —
  structurally, and without anything having to assert a fact. That is how the
  "`login` starts `fontd`" hack (`FONT-SERVICE.md` §3) was **deleted** (§2.14,
  SVC-5), not reworked. The one-way non-GUI→GUI edge stays intact
  (§17.3/§17.4).

### 3.4 On-demand activation — capability-brokered endpoint activation

On a capability OS the correct on-demand mechanism is **not** Linux
socket-activation; it is capability-brokered endpoint activation:

- A shared service owns a well-known reserved IPC endpoint (the pattern
  `FONT_ENDPOINT` / `lib/abi/src/{window,display,net}_ipc.rs` already use).
- A client asks the service manager (capability-gated, §5.4) to **connect**
  to that endpoint. If the service is not running the manager starts it (as
  its sandboxed service account), **parks the client** until the service is
  *ready* (§2.23 — wake on the readiness event, never busy-poll), then hands
  back the endpoint.
- This one mechanism serves on-demand start, dependency-triggered start, and
  multiuser sharing. Requests that arrive while a service is `starting` are
  **queued and woken** on ready (§2.23), the queue **bounded** and
  fail-closed (§24.3) — never dropped, never spun on.

### 3.5 Idle stop — a defined sink and a tickless linger

- Define **sink** = live connected clients: a refcount on the reserved
  endpoint.
- Last client disconnects (refcount → 0) → arm a **one-shot tickless linger
  timer** (§17.1) → on expiry with refcount still zero, run the graceful
  stop (§3.6). Any new connect before expiry cancels the timer. No polling
  loop (§2.23).
- The linger duration and activation mode (`permanent | on-demand{linger}`)
  are **per-service unit metadata** in the signed `AppInfo`, not hard-coded.
  A web server is `permanent`; `fontd` is `on-demand`.

### 3.6 Stop / shutdown

- **Graceful per-service stop:** stop request → **grace timeout** (`Time64`,
  §21; configurable per-service) → forced terminate only if it has not
  exited. No blind kill.
- **Reverse-dependency ordering:** on stop and on shutdown, tear down in the
  reverse of start order; a service is not stopped before its dependents.
  Same determinism / cycle rejection as start order, applied in reverse.
- **Idle stop is a special case of stop** (§3.5).
- **System shutdown:** per-user managers stopped first (each stops its
  user's services in reverse-dep order), then system services in
  reverse-dep order, then PID 1 exits last.

### 3.7 Restart policy

`restart = never | on-failure | always` with **bounded exponential backoff**
(the crash-loop budget already in `supervisor.rs`), plus an optional
**health-check / watchdog** tied to `plans/WATCHDOG.md`. A **blind periodic
restart** is the §2.1 "retry-until-it-works" hack and is **not** a default;
if offered at all it is opt-in, audited, and documented as a workaround, not
a feature.

### 3.8 Control API + tool + observability

- A versioned, capability-checked `lib/abi` **control surface**
  (`start / stop / enable / disable / status`) — the `systemctl` analogue.
  Status is served through the System Information API (§16.6), **never** a
  `/proc` / `/sys` view (§16.1); no free-form text scraping.
- A `userland/shell/` control tool over that API.
- **Audit:** extend `events.rs` IDs for on-demand start, activation,
  idle-stop, restart, readiness, and denials — every security-relevant
  decision with a stable ID (§5.4/§19.4).

### 3.9 Resource limits and RAM

- Per-service `rlimit`/`ulimit` (§24.3) is **optional** unit metadata in the
  signed `AppInfo`; the default is *unset* (uncapped — an `apache`-class
  service may consume the machine). Raising a hard bound above the inherited
  ceiling needs an explicit capability (`CAP_RLIMIT_RAISE`); enforcement is
  kernel-side and fails closed (§5.4).
- No per-service RAM *cap* default and no compile-time RAM `const` (§24.1).
  A greedy service is bounded by the machine, a **system reserve** (a
  discovered-RAM fraction — a policy, not a scalar — §24.2) that keeps the
  kernel/PID 1/log path alive, and the fairness + reclaim arbiter with
  **per-principal accounting** (§26.2/§26.3), not by an arbitrary number.

### 3.10 The `MAX_SERVICES` fix — bound vs capacity (§24.1/§24.4)

- The **compiled-in boot floor** (`console`, `sysinfod`, `netstack`,
  `devmgr`, `seatmgr`, `login`) is a genuinely fixed, irreducible set
  (§18.6). Its size is a **bound dictated by the floor**, so it may stay
  fixed — but the magic `MAX_SERVICES = 4` that would silently *truncate* a
  fifth floor entry is a latent defect: size the floor parser to the actual
  floor set and **fail closed** (`ConfigError::TooManyServices`) if the
  config exceeds it, never drop entries.
- The **discovered / registered tier** (everything past the floor) is a
  **growable capacity**: sized from what is discovered and grown once the
  `lib/rt` heap lands (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5b, §25). **No `const` cap there.**

---

## 4. Invariants (must hold)

- **One engine, two scopes** (§3.2); the boundary invariants of §3.2 hold.
- **Discovery ≠ registration ≠ activation** (§3.1); presence never grants
  eligibility; no compiled-in service list beyond the floor (§18.5/§18.6).
- **No ambient authority** (§4): a user activation grants a *connection*,
  never a service's own authority; a user service runs within the user's
  ceiling only.
- **Fail closed everywhere** (§5.4): missing/corrupt registration store →
  the service is simply not eligible, never a guess; bounded queues; every
  denial audited.
- **No busy-poll** (§2.23): clients park on readiness; idle-stop is a
  one-shot tickless timer; supervision waits on child exit.
- **All timers/backoff/linger are `Time64`** (§21).
- **Signed metadata** (§9): unit metadata lives in the signed `AppInfo`;
  tamper = load refusal. The registration store is never a second copy.
- **PID 1 stays minimal** (§4): it reaps its own children, and the kernel's
  sessions — not a reaper — end what an exited service left behind.
- **Untrusted parsing** of enrolment/registration input fails closed and, if
  it grows non-trivial, is sandboxed (§19.5) with a fuzz harness (§19.6).

---

## 5. Scope audit (surprises checked in the tree)

- **`MAX_SERVICES`** (`startup.rs`) is a floor-sized fail-closed bound derived
  from `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (not a magic `4`); the bound tests assert the floor
  exactly fills it and that a longer config fails closed (SVC-1, done). The
  supervisor no longer carries a service slot bound at all — SVC-A moved the
  services into the `Init` engine, so `supervisor.rs` now sizes only the
  per-console session table (`MAX_SUPERVISED_CONSOLES`).
- **`login` starts `fontd`** (`FONT-SERVICE.md` §3; `login`'s start path,
  the x86_64/riscv64 compiled-in `FONTD_PATH`/`FONTD_MANIFEST`/
  `SPAWN_PROGRAMS` fallbacks): deleted in favour of readiness-condition
  activation. This is the main deletion (§2.14) and touches `login`, the
  spawn-program registry, and `FONT-SERVICE.md`.
- **Registration-store read**: reuse `SystemFileService::read_system_config`
  + `SystemConfigFile` (add the services store path to the closed set) — no
  new pre-unlock read path.
- **Discovery**: reuse `enumerate_driver_store`/`list_store` over
  `/System/Services/` — no new scanner.
- **Heap dependency**: the growable registered tier depends on the `lib/rt`
  userland heap (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5b). Until it lands the floor stays
  no-heap and exactly-sized; the growable tier is staged behind the heap.
- **New `lib/abi`**: readiness-notification, control API, and (if needed) a
  service-manager IPC endpoint — versioned/hashed (§9), C view regenerated
  (`cargo xtask c-header --write`), `abi-check` clean.

---

## 6. Stages

Each stage leaves the whole-project §7 gate green before it is reported done.

### SVC-1 — Kill the `MAX_SERVICES` cap; floor-sized fail-closed bound
- `startup::MAX_SERVICES` is derived from `DEFAULT_CONFIG` by a `const fn`
  service-directive counter, so the floor sizes its own bound and a stale
  magic number can neither silently truncate a floor entry nor drift. (The
  old `supervisor::MAX_SUPERVISED_SERVICES` alias was retired in SVC-A when
  the services moved into the engine; only the session table remains in the
  supervisor.) A
  config exceeding the floor fails closed (`ConfigError::TooManyServices`);
  no behaviour change for the shipped floor. Tests assert the floor exactly
  fills the bound and that the `const` counter agrees with the runtime parser.
  The growable, discovery-registered tier past the floor is SVC-3/SVC-4 and
  waits on the `lib/rt` heap (§3.10).

### SVC-A — Capability authority + the live PID 1 engine

**Decision (confirmed): the kernel is the single capability authority.** A
service is launched by naming its binary and its **service account** uid; the
kernel loads the signed bundle and grants `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` (the
same gate `drvhost` runs for drivers, §8/§18.6). The manager never decodes a
manifest or computes a grant on the launch path, so there is no second,
divergent capability-derivation path to keep in step with the kernel's. This
resolves the mismatch between the earlier engine design (init decodes the
manifest, intersects with its own authority, and passes an explicit `granted`
set) and the live spawn-as-account model (the kernel derives the grant):
the live model wins, and the engine is reshaped to it in place (§2.13).

- **Engine reshaped to the kernel-authority model — DONE.** `ServiceSpec`
  carries `account: u32` instead of manifest bytes; `Spawner::spawn(spec)`
  drops the `granted` argument; the manager drops `InitConfig.authority` /
  `accepted_abi_version`, `requested_capabilities`, the init-side
  intersection, `StartedService.granted`, and the retired
  `SERVICE_DENIED` (9003) audit id / `StartFailure::{ManifestInvalid,
  CapabilityEscalation}` (a refused load now surfaces as the kernel's own
  `SpawnFailed`). Enrolment decodes no manifest either: it records
  eligibility, and the kernel derives authority at spawn (SVC-3). Host tests
  updated; the 3 tests
  that asserted init-side intersection/escalation are deleted (§2.14). The
  live boot is unchanged (the engine is still only reached from tests), so
  the existing boot behaviour and QEMU verticals are untouched by this step.
- **Engine wired into live PID 1 — DONE.** `userland/system/init/src/run.rs`
  no longer runs the flat, no-heap `supervise`-over-`StartupConfig` service
  path (deleted, §2.14). PID 1 now builds the heap-backed `Init` engine over
  real seams — `RtSpawner` (`spawn_in(path, &service_attach(0, account))`), `RtStopper`
  (`signal` — `Terminate` then, only after grace, `Kill`), `LogSink` (the
  `lib/rt` production `tairix_log::Sink` over `log_emit`), and `LoopReaper`
  (`service.rs`, the interior-mutable mailbox the wait loop fills so
  `Init::reap` drains one child without a second `wait`) — registers the
  boot-floor services from `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (each named by its `.app`
  bundle stem via `startup::service_name`, account uid resolved at parse
  time, all default `Immediate`/`Permanent`/`Never`), and `start_all`s them
  in dependency order, reporting any kernel-refused service on `stderr` and
  booting on.
- Per-console **session** supervision stays a distinct concern layered over
  the engine (`supervisor.rs`, rewritten to session-only): the one wait-any
  loop routes each reaped pid to the per-console `login` slot (crash-loop
  relaunch within `SESSION_SPAWN_BUDGET`) or, for every other pid, to the
  engine through the new `Services` seam (`EngineServices`) — a service exit
  applies its restart policy, an untracked child is logged — and only declares
  `Exhausted` when no session is alive **and** the engine holds no running
  service, so a perpetual service (`devmgr`) keeps PID 1 up. The supervision
  policy is host-tested with mock `Sessions`/`Services`; the engine and
  `LoopReaper` are host-tested in their own modules; the real seam glue is
  freestanding-only and covered by the boot vertical.
- Verified: the aarch64 `spawn_session` QEMU boot vertical is green (PID 1
  boots on the heap-backed engine, spawns `sysinfod`/`netstack`/`devmgr`/
  `seatmgr` in order then the login session, waits, and relaunches login).
  The x86_64/riscv64 boot verticals and the full §7 gate share the same
  arch-neutral `init` source and are expected to follow; they run in CI.

### SVC-2 — Lifecycle + readiness protocol (`lib/abi` + engine)
- `lib/abi/src/service.rs` (versioned/fail-closed, frozen on first release):
  the `ServiceState` lifecycle (`inactive → starting → ready → running →
  stopping → stopped | failed`) with `is_ready`/`is_terminal`; the closed
  `ReadyCondition` set (`network-up`, `filesystems-mounted`, `boot-complete`,
  `display-present`, `seat-available`); `ReadinessKind` (`immediate` default
  vs `notify`); and the `ServiceNotice` (`sd_notify` analogue) carrying a
  `LifecycleSignal` (`ready`/`failed`) and **no identity** — the manager
  binds it to the kernel-attested sender. It is an IPC-protocol module like
  `font_ipc`, so it is outside the generated C header (no `abi-check`/
  `c-header` change).
- `init` engine (`manager.rs`): per-service `ServiceState`+pid; `ServiceSpec`
  gains `readiness`/`requires`/`provides`. Bring-up is a readiness-gated
  admission fixpoint — a dependent is released only when every dependency is
  `is_ready()` and every required condition is satisfied, never on merely
  spawned. `immediate` services reach ready on spawn success; `notify`
  services wait for `Init::notify`. `satisfy_condition` records
  externally/kernel-signalled conditions, which nothing withdraws; a provider
  satisfies its `provides` on readiness and holds them only while it is
  ready. When the last ready provider of a condition stops being ready — a
  reaped exit, a watchdog kill, or a stop — the condition is withdrawn
  (`CONDITION_WITHDRAWN`, 9029) and every live requirer, with its
  name-dependents, is stopped and *held*: its reap returns it to `inactive`,
  and the pump that follows admits it at once if the condition is already
  back. A hold spends no restart budget; a stop or shutdown is final and
  cancels any hold, pending restart, or pending admission. Everything fails
  closed: a never-ready dependency leaves its dependent `inactive`, and
  `notify` is refused (`NotifyError`) for an unknown or non-`starting`
  service. Audit IDs `SERVICE_READY` (9008), `CONDITION_SATISFIED` (9009),
  `NOTIFY_REJECTED` (9010).
- `netstack` is the first truthful producer: it is `notify`-ready, announces
  once its endpoints are bound, and provides `network-up`, which `discoveryd`
  requires — its sockets live in the stack, so a stack relaunch brings it
  back against the new one rather than leaving it deaf.
- Because `immediate` is the readiness default, the existing bring-up
  semantics (and their tests) are preserved unchanged; new host tests cover
  the `notify`/condition gating, the never-ready and explicit-failure paths,
  and the fail-closed notify rejections.
- Not yet wired to a live transport: the manager consumes decoded notices
  through its engine seam; binding the readiness/control endpoint and mapping
  a kernel-attested sender to a service is SVC-4/SVC-8 work.

### SVC-3 — Discovery + the enrolment store under `/System/Settings`
- The enrolment engine is `lib/enrolment` (`no_std` + `alloc`, host-tested;
  `docs/src/lib/enrolment.md`). Enrolment is layered. `Enrolment` is the
  image's layer, compiled into PID 1's startup configuration because nothing
  under `/System` is reliably readable when the manager decides. The
  administrator's `EnrolmentOverride` is `/System/Settings/Services/overrides`
  on the encrypted root (a user's own under `Settings/Services/`) and holds
  only what differs from the image, so an update's new defaults reach
  everything the administrator never touched. `effective` is the one fold of
  the two, and `overrides_for` the one derivation back.
- `validate_service_name` is the strict lowercase `[a-z0-9._-]` (alnum-first)
  identifier rule, a security control against traversal- and
  case-collision-shaped names. The override document is untrusted input,
  refused whole on any defect and located at its line; a refused or missing
  one leaves the image's layer standing. Its only fixed bound is
  `MAX_DOCUMENT_LEN`, which `to_store_text` holds the writer to as well.
- `enrol`/`unenrol` are pure record transforms deciding eligibility only; the
  kernel derives a service's authority from its signed bundle and its
  account's ceiling at spawn. The manager's `enrol_control` refuses, changing
  nothing, a name it does not know or whose account is outside its scope, an
  unregistered service whose dependencies are not registered, a document past
  the bound, and a write the store refuses. A recorded change is written
  before the running system follows it; a start or stop that then fails is
  `EnrolOutcome::Unapplied`, with the record standing.
- Activation wiring: `Init::register_enrolled(discovered, vendor, overrides)`
  registers a discovered `ServiceSpec` only where the effective enrolment
  enables it. A present-but-unenrolled bundle is audited
  `SERVICE_NOT_ENROLLED` (9011) and kept known, so it can be enabled by name;
  one enabled at runtime joins the admission order. Pre-unlock the manager
  boots on the image's layer and narrows to the administrator's with
  `adopt_overrides` once the document is readable.
- Discovery is the startup configuration's enrolled tier; scanning
  `/System/Services` for bundles waits on the growable registered tier
  (§3.10). The `AppInfo` unit-metadata parse is SVC-3b.

### SVC-3b — Service unit-metadata record + discovery parser
- `lib/abi/src/service.rs` gains the `ServiceManifest`/`ServiceUnit` pair —
  the compact, versioned, fail-closed binary record of a service's unit
  metadata (`SERVICE_MANIFEST_MAGIC` = `"SUM1"`, `SERVICE_VERSION_V1`): the
  service account, readiness kind, activation mode + idle-linger, restart
  policy, stop grace, connect capability, and the dependency names and
  required/provided `ReadyCondition`s. `ServiceUnit` is the allocation-free
  encoder input; `ServiceManifest` is the borrowed decoder view whose
  `from_bytes` validates the *whole* record up front (magic, version,
  reserved bytes, known flag bits, every enum discriminant, every count
  against its bound, every dependency name as bounded UTF-8, an exact overall
  length, and the canonical forms — reserved/connect-cap/linger forced to
  zero unless their flag says otherwise) so every accessor is infallible and
  a malformed byte fails closed. It is an IPC-protocol module like
  `ServiceNotice`, so it is outside the generated C header (no `abi-check`/
  `c-header` change), and its decoder has a `fuzz_decode` arm asserting the
  never-panic + canonical-round-trip contract (§19.6). The metadata is the
  data that lives in the service's **signed** `AppInfo` bundle manifest (§2),
  so tampering is a load refusal upstream.
- `ServiceSpec::from_manifest(name, binary_path, &ServiceManifest)` is the
  bridge from a decoded manifest to the `ServiceSpec` the manager consumes,
  applying the manager's strict **name policy** (`tairix_enrolment::validate_service_name`,
  §2.2 — one authoritative check, not duplicated in the ABI) to the service
  name and every dependency name, so a manifest can never smuggle a
  path-traversal-shaped dependency into the graph. Fails closed on a name
  defect. Host tests cover the full round trip of every field and the
  name-policy rejection of a bad service or dependency name.
- Still ahead: reading the `ServiceManifest` bytes out of a discovered
  `/System/Services` bundle's signed `AppInfo` and calling `from_manifest` on
  the live boot path. Until the discovery scan lands, the floor's own shape —
  including which entries are `ondemand` — comes from the compiled-in boot
  description, which is the one place the floor has ever been described.

### SVC-4 — On-demand endpoint activation + idle linger
- `lib/abi/src/service.rs` gains `ActivationMode` (`Permanent` |
  `OnDemand { linger: Duration64 }`) — unit metadata carried in the signed
  manifest, IPC-protocol module so no `abi-check`/`c-header` change.
  `ServiceSpec` gains `activation`, `stop_grace` (default `DEFAULT_STOP_GRACE`
  = 5 s), and `connect_capability` builders/accessors.
- New seams in `service.rs`: `ClientId` (kernel-attested connection id) and
  `Stopper` (`request_stop` graceful + `force_terminate`), wired through
  `InitConfig`.
- `Init` engine (`manager.rs`): the one capability-brokered activation entry
  `connect(name, client_caps, client)` — capability check **before** any
  state (fail closed), then connect-now if ready, activate-if-down (start as
  the service account, fail closed when a required readiness condition is
  unmet — the headless case), or park behind a **bounded** per-service queue
  (`MAX_PENDING_PER_SERVICE`, a §24.4 anti-flood security bound → `QueueFull`).
  Parked clients are released into the sink and reported via
  `take_ready_clients` when the service reaches ready (through boot admission,
  a readiness notice, or a satisfied condition) — woken by the event, never
  polled. `disconnect(name, client, now)` refcounts the sink and arms a single
  one-shot idle-linger deadline when the last interest leaves an on-demand
  service; a new `connect` cancels it. `expire_linger`/`expire_grace` are the
  one-shot-timer callbacks the transport arms from `linger_deadline`/
  `grace_deadline`. `pump` now **skips on-demand services** so they are never
  eagerly started at boot.
- The graceful-stop primitive (request → `Stopping` → grace deadline →
  `force_terminate`, and `reap` mapping a stopping service's exit to
  `Stopped` regardless of code) landed here because idle-stop is a special
  case of it (§2.2/§2.19); SVC-7 builds restart policy and reverse-dependency
  ordering on top of it rather than reinventing it.
- New audit IDs (9012–9017): `SERVICE_ACTIVATED`, `ACTIVATION_QUEUED`,
  `ACTIVATION_DENIED` (unknown/capability/unavailable/queue-full),
  `SERVICE_LINGER_ARMED`, `SERVICE_STOPPING`, `SERVICE_FORCE_TERMINATED`.
- Host tests cover: on-demand not started at boot; connect activates a down
  immediate service and connects now (shared by a second client); a notify
  service parks until it announces ready then wakes the parked client once;
  the full idle → linger → graceful stop → grace → force → reap-to-`Stopped`
  lifecycle; a new connect cancels a pending linger; the capability check runs
  before any state; unknown-service and condition-gated (headless) connects
  fail closed; the pending queue is bounded and fails closed; `add_duration`
  carry/saturation.
- The live transport is SVC-5 below: PID 1 binds the activation endpoint,
  reads the connecting principal's `ClientId` from the call's attested
  origin, and arms the one-shot timers off `linger_deadline`/`grace_deadline`
  through `next_deadline`/`expire_due`. The growable registered tier past the
  floor still waits on the `lib/rt` heap (§3.10).

### SVC-5 — On-demand `fontd`; the `login`-starts-`fontd` hack deleted

**The defect this closed, measured.** `ipc_call` to an unbound endpoint fails
closed with `NotFound` — it does not park. `login::ensure_fontd` spawned the
service detached and went straight on, so a consumer that reached
`FONT_ENDPOINT` first got `FontUnavailable` and `lib/svg` refused the whole
document. The desktop was exposed to it; it was a live race, not a test
artefact.

**What now happens.** `fontd` is registered on-demand and started by nothing.
A client asks the manager to connect it, the manager activates the service and
parks the call, the service announces readiness once it has bound its
endpoint, and the manager answers the parked call. The ordering is the
system's, and the whole handshake lives in one place on each side.

**The transport, and why it needed no kernel change.**

- **Park without polling.** `call_recv` yields a per-call *ticket* and
  `call_reply(endpoint, ticket, …)` answers it later, so the manager holds a
  parked client's ticket and replies when the engine reports the park
  resolved. The client's own `ipc_call` blocks in the kernel throughout.
- **Identity and authority are kernel-attested.** `call_peer_origin` returns
  an `Origin`; the activation path reads its `ProcId` as the `ClientId` and
  its `CapabilitySummary` as the set `Init::connect` checks, never anything
  the frame carried.
- **Four endpoints, not four ops.** `SERVICE_ACTIVATION_ENDPOINT` (a client
  brokering a connection) and `SERVICE_NOTICE_ENDPOINT` (a service announcing
  itself) each take their own reserved id beside `SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` /
  `SERVICE_ENROL_ENDPOINT`, for the reason recorded there: different acts,
  different gates, free to diverge. The activation request reuses the existing
  frame prefix and bounded name; the notice *is* the existing `ServiceNotice`.
- **Neither new endpoint carries a send capability, deliberately.** Any
  principal may *ask* for a shared service — what decides the answer is the
  per-service `connect_capability` the engine checks against the caller's
  attested authority, and restricting the endpoint would instead put every
  service behind one capability and make the per-service gate unreachable.
  Reaching the notice endpoint buys even less: a notice names no service, so
  it can only ever say something about its own sender.

**How a notice is attributed, and why that is sound.** The manager resolves a
notice from two facts the kernel vouches for about the sender — the process id
it recorded when it spawned the service, and the account the kernel switched
that process onto — and only against a service that is still `starting`. The
account is the load-bearing half: only the manager holds the authority to
start a process on a service account, so the set of principals bearing one is
exactly the set of instances it spawned, and the process id then picks the
instance out of that set. Task ids are drawn at random from the 40-bit pid
space and are not reusable while their task is live, so the residue is a
same-account instance drawing a dead sibling's number inside the reap window —
an accident, not a reachable attack, and one that could gain nothing a
same-account instance does not already have. `ClientId` is the attested
`ProcId` rather than a pid for the reason recorded in its own docs: a client
identity outlives the call that made it, where a notice does not.

**Every park resolves, both ways.** `Init::take_released_clients` reports each
park exactly once as `Connected` or `Abandoned`; the transport replies to the
held ticket either way. Abandonment is what a service whose process dies
before readiness, one that announces its own failure, or a client that
withdraws all produce — before this, each of those silently dropped the
engine's waiter and left the client blocked on a reply nothing would send.

**Registration.** The compiled-in boot description gained an `ondemand <path>
<account>` directive: registered, not started, given the shared idle-linger
default and marked `notify`-ready. An on-demand service is necessarily
`notify`-ready — what a client waits for is the endpoint being answerable, and
only the service knows when it has bound it. That directive is the *floor's*
description, the one place the floor's shape has ever lived; a discovered
bundle carries its own activation mode, linger and readiness in its signed
manifest through `ServiceSpec::from_manifest`, so there is no second source of
truth.

**`fontd` requires no readiness condition, and this is deliberate.** The
earlier sketch had it `require` `display-present` with `seatmgr` providing it.
`seatmgr` is a seat-administration broker that runs on a headless machine
exactly as it does on a graphical one, and `devmgr` likewise reaches ready
either way, so `provides = display-present` on either would assert something
neither knows — and a lie in a security gate is worse than no gate. Nor is the
condition needed: only a graphical consumer ever asks for a glyph, so
on-demand activation *is* the "never on a headless machine" guarantee,
structurally and exactly. The condition machinery (engine and ABI) stands
unchanged and gains its producer when a truthful one exists — the honest
candidate is the display driver's bind of `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`, which no
registered service observes today.

**The consumer side, in one place.** `lib/font` connects through the broker
once, before its first request, under the same one-shot that installs its
transport — so every graphical consumer inherits the ordering without its own
handshake. A refused connect is not fatal: the call is an ordering handshake,
not an authorisation, so a machine whose manager does not broker the service
degrades exactly as it did before.

**Deleted (§2.14).** `login::ensure_fontd`, its `FONTD_STARTED` latch,
`FONTD_SERVICE_PATH`, and the `FONTD_STARTED` / `FONTD_UNAVAILABLE` audit ids
(numbers left as gaps, never reused). `FONT-SERVICE.md` §3 and
`docs/src/userland/fontd.md` were rewritten in the same change.

**Kept, deliberately: the compiled-in `FONTD_RXE` program row.** It is not a
`login` fallback. `spawn_layout.rs` embeds every service and command app on
x86_64/riscv64 — the explicitly-justified boot floor for the ports whose
on-disk storage floors have not landed (`plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md`) — and compiles
none of them on aarch64, which spawns from the verified store bundle. Removing
`fontd`'s row alone would break the font service on two ports while leaving
its twenty siblings; it goes when that whole table does.

**QEMU witness.** `tairix-test-svgtext-qemu-aarch64` no longer waits for a
`fontd` readiness line before typing its command: the fixture's first glyph
request is what activates the service, and the broker holds that call until
the endpoint answers. A script that gated on the service first would have been
testing its own ordering rather than the system's, so the enrolment pins that
it does not.

### SVC-6 — Per-user manager scope
- **Authority scope is a first-class engine value.** `init/src/scope.rs`
  defines `AuthorityScope` (`System` | `User { uid }`) with `permits_account`;
  `InitConfig` carries it, `Init` stores it, and `Init::scope()` exposes it.
  It is the "one engine, two scopes" of §3.2 realised as data, not a forked
  codebase (§2.2): PID 1 (`run.rs`) is `System`; a per-user manager instance
  is `User { uid }`.
- **The boundary is an identity check, enforced before state (§5.4), never a
  capability derivation.** Because a service always launches as a service
  account and the kernel derives the grant from that account's ceiling
  (SVC-A), a per-user manager may manage only services running as its own
  `uid`. `Init::register` refuses (`InitError::ScopeViolation`, audit
  `SERVICE_SCOPE_REJECTED` 9020) any spec whose account is outside scope, so a
  user's manager can neither raise a service to system authority nor reach
  another user's services; the system scope permits any account.
  `register_enrolled` inherits the check, so even a positively-enrolled but
  out-of-scope bundle fails closed before any service starts. This stays
  consistent with SVC-A — the engine decodes no manifest and computes no grant
  on the launch path; the enrolment-ceiling check (registry) remains the only
  manifest read, governing eligibility not the grant.
- Host tests cover the §3.2 invariants: system scope manages any account; a
  user scope manages only its own uid; a user scope cannot bring up a system
  service nor another user's service (fail closed + audited); an out-of-scope
  enrolment fails closed; and `permits_account`/`scope()` behaviour. Docs
  updated (`docs/src/userland/init.md` *Authority scope*).
- **Remaining.** Spawning the per-user manager at session start with the
  user's sub-ceiling, parenting/supervising/reaping the user's services, and
  logout teardown in reverse-dependency order. The *shared sandboxed service*
  case — a user activation of system-scoped `fontd` is brokered a connection,
  never the service's authority (§3.2) — is live with SVC-5's activation
  broker.

### SVC-7 — Restart policy + reverse-dependency stop/shutdown ordering
- `lib/abi/src/service.rs` gains `RestartPolicy` (`never` | `on-failure` |
  `always`, default `never`) — unit metadata carried in the signed manifest,
  IPC-protocol module so no `abi-check`/`c-header` change. `never` is the
  default (a service is brought back only when its manifest asks), `on-failure`
  restarts only after a non-zero/crash exit, `always` after any exit;
  `should_restart(exit_code)` is the one decision point. `ServiceSpec` gains
  `restart`/`with_restart`/`restart()`.
- `Init` engine (`manager.rs`): `reap` now takes the monotonic `now` and, for
  an exit the manager did **not** itself initiate (a graceful idle-stop or
  shutdown is honoured, never fought), schedules a policy-driven restart via
  `schedule_restart`: it arms a single one-shot `restart_deadline` from the
  service's `tairix_util::retry::RestartPacer` and audits
  `SERVICE_RESTART_SCHEDULED` (9018). The pacer is the one restart-pacing
  definition, shared with `lib/sandbox`'s supervised worker: 100 ms base, ×2,
  clamped to a 30 s cap, saturating. The crash-loop budget
  (`MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS` = 5) bounds a *tight* loop and fails closed
  (`SERVICE_RESTART_EXHAUSTED`, 9019) rather than relaunching forever (§2.1);
  the pacer forgets the run once a relaunched service has run past
  `RESTART_STABLE_WINDOW_NS` (30 s), so a long-lived daemon that crashes once
  after hours restarts with a full budget. `expire_restart_backoff(name, now)`
  is the one-shot-timer callback the transport arms from `restart_deadline`; it
  returns the service to `Inactive` and re-drives the admission `pump` (woken by
  the event, never polled). `dependency_failed` ignores a `Failed` dependency
  that has a live restart deadline, so a restarting dependency does not
  permanently skip its dependents.
- Reverse-dependency teardown: `stop(name, now)` gracefully stops `name` and its
  transitive dependents dependents-first (`dependent_closure` + reversed
  topological `reverse_stop_order`), and `shutdown(now)` tears the whole set
  down the same way — the system-shutdown sequence (per-user managers stop their
  users' services and exit first, then the system manager `shutdown`s the system
  services). Both cancel any pending restart first (a deliberate stop is never
  fought with a relaunch), and both build on the SVC-4 graceful-stop primitive
  (`begin_stop`, `Stopping`, grace deadline → `expire_grace` → force) — not a
  reinvention (§2.2). `stop` fails closed on an unknown name.
- Host tests cover: every policy (never leaves a crash down; on-failure restarts
  an abnormal exit but honours a clean one; always restarts even a clean exit);
  the backoff doubling+cap (the pacer's own tests in `lib/util`); the crash-loop
  budget bounding a tight loop and failing closed; the stable-window budget
  reset; reverse-dependency `shutdown` and `stop` ordering (dependents first,
  independents untouched); fail-closed unknown-service stop; and shutdown
  cancelling a pending restart.
- The capability-gated control surface that gates *who* may `stop`/restart a
  service is SVC-8; the one-shot-timer wiring off `restart_deadline` is live in
  PID 1's park through `next_deadline`/`expire_due`. A blind periodic restart
  is not offered (§2.1, §3.7). The health-check/liveness **watchdog** that turns a *wedged* (rather
  than exited) service into that same restart path landed as an engine core in
  SVC-8 (below).

### SVC-8 — Control API + tool + audit + rlimits + docs/gate
- **Per-service `rlimit` unit metadata — DONE (ABI + engine core).** The
  `ServiceManifest`/`ServiceUnit` SUM1 record carries an optional
  per-service resource-limit section: a `limits_count u16` at prefix offset
  48 (`reserved0` kept reserved; the fixed prefix has since grown to hold the
  watchdog field below) and a body of
  `ServiceLimit { kind: LimitKind, limit: ResourceLimit }` entries encoded as
  `(u32 kind ‖ u64 soft ‖ u64 hard)`. The section is **canonical** — strictly
  ascending by `LimitKind` discriminant, so a duplicate or descending kind, a
  malformed (`soft > hard`) bound, an unknown discriminant, or more than
  `SERVICE_MANIFEST_MAX_LIMITS` (= `LimitKind::COUNT`) entries all fail the
  record closed — reusing the existing `lib/abi::rlimit` types (no second
  limit model, §2.2) and the existing `CAP_RLIMIT_RAISE` gate (no new
  capability). It stays an IPC-protocol module outside the generated C header
  (no `abi-check`/`c-header` change) and its decoder is covered by the
  `fuzz_decode` never-panic/canonical-round-trip arm (§19.6). `ServiceSpec`
  gains `limits`/`with_limits`/`limits()`, and `ServiceSpec::from_manifest`
  threads the decoded limits through so a discovered bundle's declared
  limits reach the manager. **Kernel enforcement at spawn** (threading
  `spec.limits()` into the spawn path) is still ahead — the metadata is
  carried and validated now; the live enforcement wiring is not yet in the
  boot path.
- **Control surface (start/stop) — DONE (ABI + engine core).** The versioned
  reserved-endpoint control protocol is `lib/abi/src/service_control.rs`:
  `SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` (registered in `is_reserved_endpoint`), a
  fixed-size bounds-checked `ServiceControlRequest` (`ServiceControlOp::{Start,
  Stop}` + a bounded UTF-8 service name, reusing `SERVICE_MANIFEST_MAX_NAME_LEN`,
  §2.2) with canonical framing, and a status-framed reply carrying the resulting
  `ServiceState`. It is an IPC-protocol module (outside the generated C header,
  no `abi-check`/`c-header` change) and its decoders are in the `fuzz_decode`
  harness (§19.6) — which found and fixed an `i32::MIN` status-word negate
  overflow (regression-tested). The engine side is `Init::control` dispatching
  to a new client-less `start_service` (reusing `admissible`/`try_start`/
  `mark_ready`/`pump`) and the existing reverse-dependency `stop`; it validates
  the name against `tairix_enrolment::validate_service_name` and fails closed
  (`ControlError::{UnknownService,Unavailable,NotStartable}`), auditing every
  outcome with new IDs `SERVICE_CONTROL_STARTED` (9021), `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOPPED`
  (9022), `SERVICE_CONTROL_DENIED` (9023). Authorization is the endpoint's
  (kernel-enforced send cap), not re-checked in the dispatch (§5.2); `start` is
  idempotent, condition-gated (headless fails closed, §17.3), and supersedes a
  pending restart backoff. Host-tested; enable/disable (store-write) and status
  (§16.6) are deliberately *not* on this endpoint.
- **Liveness watchdog + restart — DONE (ABI + engine core).** The
  health-check source `plans/WATCHDOG.md` names, wired to the SVC-7 restart
  engine so a *wedged* (still-present-but-unresponsive) service is recovered
  exactly like a crashed one — the service-manager home of the storage
  driver-lockup tie-in (`plans/FIX-IO.md` IO5). The SUM1 record grows a
  `watchdog Duration64` (offset 50, fixed prefix 50→62; zero = opt-out; a
  negative interval fails the record closed), the analogue of systemd's
  `WatchdogSec`; it stays an IPC-protocol module (no `abi-check`/`c-header`
  change) and rides the `fuzz_decode` round-trip arm. `ServiceUnit`/
  `ServiceManifest`/`ServiceSpec` gain `watchdog`/`with_watchdog`/`watchdog()`
  and `from_manifest` threads it. The `Init` engine gains, beside the existing
  one-shot deadlines and reusing them exactly (no second restart engine, §2.2):
  `arm_watchdogs(now)` (idempotently arms a running, opted-in service's
  `watchdog_deadline = now + interval`, audit `SERVICE_WATCHDOG_ARMED` 9024),
  `heartbeat(name, now)` (a running service renews its deadline; fail-safe
  no-op otherwise; never audited — high-frequency), `watchdog_deadline(name)`
  (the one-shot the transport arms), and `expire_watchdog(name, now)` (a missed
  deadline force-terminates the wedged process, audit `SERVICE_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT`
  9025, and marks `killed_by_watchdog` so `reap` classifies the exit as an
  abnormal failure — regardless of the reported code — feeding the *existing*
  `schedule_restart`/backoff/crash-loop budget). A heartbeat cancels a stale
  one-shot, and `begin_stop` disarms the watchdog so a deliberate stop is never
  fought as a wedge. Host-tested: arm+idempotent+renew, healthy service never
  killed, wedge→force-kill→reap→`on-failure` relaunch (even on a zero exit
  code), wedge under `never` killed-but-left-down, and a deliberate stop
  disarming it.
- **One-shot deadline fold — DONE (engine core).** The four per-name
  deadline accessors left the transport to ask about each service in turn,
  which no reactor can do: it needs one instant to program its single wait
  from. `Init::next_deadline()` folds the soonest armed deadline across every
  service and all four kinds (`None` = wait indefinitely, take no timer), and
  `Init::expire_due(now)` runs *every* deadline that has lapsed in that
  wakeup — one wakeup can find several, including several on one service, so
  a soonest-only design would need a wakeup per deadline. It reuses the four
  existing guarded `expire_*` paths, so a deadline no longer genuinely due (a
  heartbeat landed, the process already exited) is the same no-op it is when
  called by name, and there is no second expiry engine. Two ordering facts
  worth not re-deriving: the due set is **snapshotted before any expiry runs**
  (an expiring restart backoff re-enters the admission engine, so indices
  taken earlier would not survive it), and the **force-down kinds run before
  the bring-up kind**, so a wakeup that finds both a lapsed watchdog and a
  lapsed backoff on one service does not relaunch it into its own corpse.
  Host-tested (5 tests: the empty fold, the soonest across services and
  kinds, several kinds in one wakeup, a renewed deadline left alone, and
  kill-then-reap-then-relaunch).
- **The live control transport — DONE (start/stop).** PID 1's one loop now
  parks on a **wait-set** carrying `SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT`, any-child
  readiness, and a timeout folded from `next_deadline()`; the endpoint is bound
  restricted-sender requiring the new `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL`, and
  `userland/shell/servicectl` is its first holder. Decisions worth not
  re-deriving:
  - **One loop, three wake reasons — never a second dispatch loop.** The
    session supervisor's blocking wait-on-children became a multiplexed park:
    the `Sessions::wait_next` seam reports `Woke::{Child, Control, Deadline,
    Failed}` and the pure policy routes each. A control request is therefore
    answered while the login session sits blocked on its console, instead of
    waiting for some unrelated process to exit. The session fan-out, per-console
    budget, and exhaustion policy are unchanged and still host-tested; the
    engine calls live in the `Services` backing.
  - **The park length is the engine's, so PID 1 is tickless.** Nothing armed
    means `WAITSET_TIMEOUT_NONE` — an indefinite park and no timer interrupt.
    That sentinel is now named once in `lib/abi::waitset` beside
    `WAITSET_CHILD_ANY` rather than spelled `u64::MAX` per reactor.
  - **A child member's readiness is a peek, so the reap is non-blocking.**
    `lib/rt` gained `try_wait_exit` beside `wait_exit` over one shared
    status-to-code path; a blocking reap would park the loop that owes the
    control endpoint an answer.
  - **The reply distinguishes *who* refused.** `ControlError::Unavailable` maps
    to `Busy` (retryable) and `NotStartable` to `NotSupported` — deliberately
    **not** `PermissionDenied`, because the caller's authority was sufficient
    (it reached a gated endpoint) and it is the target's bundle the load gate
    refused. Blaming the caller sends an administrator hunting the wrong
    problem. A malformed frame is answered with the decoder's own refusal
    rather than dropped: the caller waits synchronously, so a silent drop is a
    denial of service against a legitimate principal.
  - **`CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` is in `ADMINISTRATIVE_SET`**, so an administrator's
    ceiling carries it and an ordinary session's does not. Stopping the device
    manager, the network stack, or the clock reaches every principal on the
    machine, which is what makes it administrative rather than baseline. PID 1's
    manifest gained `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` for the reserved bind.
  - **The tool checks no capability.** Reaching the endpoint *is* the
    authority, so `servicectl` holds none of its own and reports the kernel's
    refusal; `enable`/`disable`/`status` are deliberately absent from both the
    tool and the endpoint (see below).
  - QEMU witness: `tairix-test-servicectl-qemu-aarch64` boots the production
    pipeline, unlocks, logs in, and runs `servicectl stop timed` at the shell,
    exiting on the engine's own `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOPPED`. The transcript shows
    the on-disk bundle resolved from `/System/Commands` and signature-verified,
    so the run also proves the tool is a real store app rather than anything
    embedded.
- **Open, and load-bearing for SVC-6: the endpoint id is per-*manager*, and
  there is currently one.** `SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` is a single well-known
  reserved id, which is right while PID 1 is the only manager but cannot serve a
  per-user manager as well — two managers cannot both bind one id, and a user's
  tool must not reach the system manager's endpoint. When the per-user manager
  is spawned at session start (SVC-6's remaining half), the id becomes
  scope-derived (a system id plus one per user) and `lib/cmdres`-style shared
  derivation decides which a caller names, so authority cannot be crossed by
  spelling. Do not add a second endpoint constant ad hoc.
- **Enablement + status — the enrolment endpoint and the §16.6 query.**
  `enable`/`disable` and `status` stay off the control endpoint: enablement
  mutates the registration store and status is served through the System
  Information API, never a control-reply scrape. What lands instead:
  - `SERVICE_ENROL_ENDPOINT`, a **second** reserved id beside
    `SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT`, in the same `lib/abi::service_control` module
    and sharing its request framing (one frame codec, §2.2) but with its own
    op set and its own reply, because the two answers differ in kind — a
    `ServiceState` versus an enabled/disabled disposition and whether it
    changed. The *endpoint* is what the no-enablement-on-control decision is
    about, not the file. Both ids become scope-derived together when the
    per-user manager lands (the open item above); neither is a second
    constant for the same purpose.
  - Both endpoints are gated by the existing `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL`. No new
    capability: nothing yet needs to grant a principal the power to restart a
    wedged service without also trusting it to disable one, so the coarse
    capability stands (§5.2), and the durable form of an administrative act is
    not a different authority from the transient form.
  - **The authority is the identity boundary, not a capability computation —
    and `enrol` therefore loses its manifest/ceiling check.** SVC-3 gave
    `enrol` a "requested ⊆ enroller's ceiling" refusal. It has never had a
    caller, and it is not merely unused but *unusable*: every system service
    holds service-scoped capabilities no human account's ceiling carries
    (`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` for `timed`, `CAP_SYSINFO_INTROSPECT` for `sysinfod`,
    `CAP_DRV_LOAD` for `devmgr`, `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` for `seatmgr`), so the check
    would refuse an administrator enabling any of them — including `timed`,
    this feature's own witness. It is also exactly the "second
    capability-derivation path" `scope.rs` states the engine must not grow.
    `enrol` becomes the pure record transform it always was in effect, and the
    three checks that do the work are: the kernel's `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` gate
    on the endpoint; the service being **known** to this manager, so a typo
    can never record a phantom enrolment a later image would activate; and
    `AuthorityScope::permits_account`, the same identity boundary the launch
    path uses, which is what stops a future per-user manager enrolling a
    system-authority service. Authority itself is unwidenable regardless: the
    kernel derives `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` at spawn.
  - **The registration store is two layers**, forced by
    `plans/NEW-NAMESPACE.md` §5: its target policy pins
    `attach.system.flags = ro` and
    `project./System/Settings = root:/System/Settings`, so the pre-unlock
    volume can never be the mutable store and the mutable path can never be
    read pre-unlock. The **administrator** layer is
    `/System/Settings/Services/overrides` on the encrypted root, holding only
    `<name> enabled|disabled` for what was changed, so a system update's new
    default takes effect at once for everything unspoken. The **vendor** layer
    is the `enrolled` directives of PID 1's startup configuration, *not* a
    document: a QEMU run settled that no file under `/System` is reliably
    readable at the instant the manager must decide what to bring up, and the
    only sanctioned pre-unlock read is the store service's `CAP_DRV_LOAD`-gated
    whitelist, which PID 1 must not hold. An on-disk vendor record waits for the
    `/System/Services` discovery scan, which needs that same read path
    and must answer the question properly. `effective` is one pure function over
    the pair. This retires the `SystemConfigFile::SystemServices` whitelist
    entry, which named a path the mount table makes unreachable and never had a
    reader (§2.14).
  - Applying the administrator layer is bounded by the unlock and is stated
    rather than hidden: pre-unlock PID 1 obeys the vendor layer alone, and the
    moment the override document is readable — on a bounded doubling one-shot
    ladder (`lib/util::retry`, shared with the clock service, which waits the
    same way for the same reason) — it re-derives the effective set and stops a
    service the administrator disabled through the existing reverse-dependency
    `stop`, audited. So a disabled service does run for the few seconds before
    the unlock. Deferring the whole enrolled tier until the ladder resolves
    would instead deny a never-unlocking machine its clock for the ladder's
    length, which is worse; nothing is granted by the document being unreadable,
    so this is a narrowing that arrives late, not a fail-open.
  - `status` is `SysinfoQueryId::SERVICE_STATUS`, a new spec at the **end** of
    `SYSINFO_QUERIES`, gated `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` and audited like
    `GLOBAL_PROCESS_LIST` (it names other principals and their pids). PID 1
    serves the rows on a read-only reserved endpoint that requires
    `CAP_SYSINFO_INTROSPECT` on the sender, so only the introspection service
    reads the manager's table and every consumer goes through the audited
    query rather than round the side of it.
  - PID 1 gains `CAP_FS_ACCESS` for the two documents. Per-inode
    authorisation still applies under its attested identity, and the vendor
    layer's volume is read-only, so its reach there can never write.
- **The live liveness watchdog — DONE (transport, first holder, vertical).**
  A heartbeat is the same act as a readiness notice — a service reporting on
  itself — so it rides SVC-5's lifecycle-notice endpoint with the same
  attested-sender attribution, not a second one. Decisions worth not
  re-deriving:
  - **A kind on the notice frame, not a third `LifecycleSignal`.**
    `ReadyNotice` became `ServiceNotice` (`Lifecycle(LifecycleSignal)` |
    `Alive`), one byte of kind beside one of signal, canonical (a signal
    riding an `Alive` frame is refused). A renewal moves the service through
    no `ServiceState` at all, so adding it to `LifecycleSignal` would have
    made that type's "an illegal self-report is unrepresentable" property a
    lie and forced `notify` to validate away a variant it cannot accept. The
    two enums share no discriminant space, so neither has to track the other.
  - **The resolution widens for the renewal only.** `notify_sender` still
    matches a `Starting` service — that narrow window is what bounds a
    readiness edge to the span between a spawn and its resolution —
    and `heartbeat_sender` matches a `Ready`/`Running` one. Both attribute
    from the same two kernel-vouched facts through one shared
    `service_index_of`, so the attribution rule has a single definition and
    only the admissible state differs.
  - **The reply carries the interval, which is how a service learns its
    cadence.** The manager holds the watchdog, so the manager answers with
    it: a service needs no copy of its own unit metadata, the two cannot
    disagree, and a disarmed watchdog is learned about on the next renewal.
    This is also what justifies keeping the synchronous ack — the reply is
    load-bearing, not an acknowledgement for its own sake — and a
    `NOTICE_REPLY_LEN` of its own beside the control and enrolment replies,
    the same reason those two differ. An unwatched service is told so by a
    zero interval and never calls again, so opting out costs one call.
  - **Refused renewals are not audited, either.** The plan already had
    heartbeats unaudited as high-frequency; the *refusals* must be too,
    because the notice endpoint takes no send capability, so auditing them
    would hand any process on the machine a log-flooding primitive pointed
    at the audit trail. A sender that matches nothing is simply refused.
  - **One client, in `lib/rt::servicenotice`.** `Watchdog` holds the
    interval and the next-due instant: `announce_ready` for a `notify`
    service, `attach` for an `immediate` one (which has no readiness edge
    left to announce), `timeout_ns` folded into the park the service already
    performs, `renew_if_due` each turn. Renewal is therefore a deadline on
    an existing wait, never a second timer and never a poll. The cadence is
    half the interval so a renewal and its reply have a further half to
    complete; renewing on the deadline would make every scheduling delay a
    false kill. `fontd`'s private `announce_ready` was deleted for it.
  - **The floor directive carries the unit metadata, as `key=value`
    options.** `service|enrolled|ondemand <path> <account>
    [watchdog=<n>s] [restart=…] [requires=<cond>,…] [provides=<cond>,…]`,
    a provider being `notify`-ready; a `session` takes none, and a repeated
    option refuses the config: the floor description is the one place a
    floor service's unit metadata has ever lived, and a discovered bundle
    takes the same fields from its signed manifest. Named options rather
    than positions because a third and fourth position would be unreadable;
    an unknown option or value refuses the whole config, since a misspelled
    interval silently meaning "unwatched" would disable a defence without
    saying so.
  - **`netstack` is the first holder** (`watchdog=30s restart=on-failure`).
    A stack whose serve loop has stopped turning is still a live process, so
    nothing else notices — every socket simply stops being answered — and
    the recovery is one the system can make on its own. It is therefore also
    the floor's one `on-failure` entry: detecting a wedge and then leaving
    the machine with no network stack is the worse outcome.
  - **Two defects the wiring surfaced, both pre-existing, both fixed here.**
    PID 1 bound its four endpoints *after* `start_all`, so a floor service
    reporting at startup would have been refused by an endpoint that did
    not exist yet; `fontd` never hit it because an on-demand service is
    activated once the loop is already running. The endpoints now bind
    first — a manager must be answerable before it starts anything that
    reports to it. And `arm_watchdogs` re-armed a process it had just
    force-terminated: the service stays `Running` with a live pid until the
    reap, so the pass in that window audited a watchdog placed on a corpse.
    It now excludes a service carrying `killed_by_watchdog`, whose lifetime
    is exactly that window.
  - QEMU witness: `tairix-test-watchdog-qemu-aarch64` boots the production
    pipeline against a disk whose `netstack` bundle is a fixture that renews
    three times — past a whole interval — then stops renewing and parks for
    good, and requires the manager to detect the wedge, force the process
    down, reap it, and relaunch it. A timeout arriving with fewer renewals
    behind it **fails** the run, because that is the trivial timeout a
    never-renewing service earns. The disk carries a test *double* because a
    wedge is the absence of a call — only the supervised program can produce
    one — and PID 1 registers only the services its compiled-in floor
    description names; that substitution retires when the
    `/System/Services` discovery scan lands and a fixture service can simply
    be discovered.
- **Remaining: kernel-enforced per-service resource limits.** `ServiceSpec`
  carries validated `limits` from the SUM1 record and nothing reads them on
  the launch path. The carrier is **not** the `SpawnAttach` block: that
  would make the manager the source of a security-relevant bound, which is
  the second derivation path SVC-A exists to forbid. The kernel already
  derives `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` from the signed bundle at load, so
  the limits belong in that same signed manifest, decoded by `lib/appload`
  and applied at admit as a pure narrowing of the inherited set (never a
  widening, so no capability is involved). `AppInfoHeader` carries no unit
  section today, so that section, its `AppInfo.toml` source key, and the
  composer's encoding of it are the work. Full §7 gate on landing.

### SVC-9 — Reclaiming an activated service when its last client dies

The idle-linger path is armed by an explicit `disconnect`, and a client that
*dies* sends none: the manager is not the parent of a font client and has no
event for its exit, so its reference stays in the sink and the service it
activated is never idle-stopped. Nothing is leaked and nothing is wrong — the
service simply outlives its last user, which is exactly the behaviour the
`login`-spawned `fontd` had — but the linger `ondemand` promises only bites
for clients that exit cleanly enough to say so, and `lib/font` deliberately
does not (a process cannot promise to run its own teardown).

What this needs is client liveness, and the kernel now provides it: the
`peer_watch` exit feed (`plans/ZEROCONF.md` Z4) tells a thread, through one
wait-set source, that a process instance it named by its attested `ProcId` has
gone — never missed, since a watch on an instance already gone is refused and
read as its exit. `netstack` and `discoveryd` release a dead principal's state
on it. What remains is the manager watching each connected client's instance
from the `Origin` of its `connect` and releasing that client's reference when
the exit lands, so the linger bites for a client that dies as for one that
disconnects — an event, never a heartbeat or a scan.

### SVC-10 — Readiness as a wake source a client can combine with its own

`connect` parks the caller until the service is ready, which is the whole
answer for a client whose only job is that call. It is no answer for a client
that must keep observing something else: `devmgr` owns the hardware tree, so
it cannot park on a service.

Its concrete case is the device-channel hand-off. A discovered `netchan` /
`audiochan` node is handed to `netstack` / `audiod`, and a hand-off issued
before that service has claimed its endpoint is refused. The service claiming
it bumps no hardware-tree generation, so nothing wakes `devmgr` to retry — it
therefore bounds its own `hw_tree_wait` deadline while a discovered channel is
still unbound and re-reacts when it expires, reusing the bounded-deadline
mechanism the driver-store catalogue already needed. That is the only
mechanism available to it: `hw_tree_wait` is a dedicated blocking syscall and
`WaitSourceKind` carries no hardware-tree source, so the two cannot be waited
on together.

The deadline is correct and self-limiting — a deferral records concrete work
in hand, so a machine with no such device defers nothing and waits
indefinitely — but it is a timer standing in for an event that now exists.
The enabling piece is making the tree generation observable as a
`WaitSourceKind`; `devmgr` then waits on tree ∪ readiness (readiness already
has a wire form in `ServiceNotice`, and the wait-set already carries
`SystemNotice`) and the deadline retires instead of being tuned.
