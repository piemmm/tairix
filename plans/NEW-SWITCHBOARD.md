# NEW-SWITCHBOARD — the Switchboard surface

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This plan fixes the Switchboard window's
information architecture, the controls it is built from, the readings it
draws, and the interfaces those readings still need. It supersedes the
six-section design entirely: the section set, the resource surface and the
wire `CommandSection` all change, and S10 lists what that deletes.

The monitor *service* behind the window — its staged sampling cadence,
tray-summary contract, capability sizing and lifecycle — is
`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T10–T12. This plan adds readings to its sample set
(S5) and moves one query between cadence tiers; nothing else about the
service changes.

## Ledger

Every work item this plan calls for, what it waits on, and where it is
specified. A task is `done` only when its tests and docs landed with it.
Nothing here is optional: an item dropped is a reading the surface then has to
lie about.

| # | Task | Depends on | Spec | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** | `Section` and wire `CommandSection` carry exactly `Tasks`, `Resources`, `Recovery`; discriminants renumbered with no reserved gap; `map_section` and its exhaustive table shrink | — | S4 | done |
| **F1** | Resources' `SectionAnatomy`: the device rail as `sidebar`, the pane as `primary`, and the shed route replacing the rail with a band `ComboBox` | A1 | S3 | done |
| **C1** | `chart::Chart` gains an optional opposing series, mirrored below a drawn midline and tinted by its own `PressureKind` | — | S7 | done |
| **C2** | `metric::CompositionBar` — named proportional segments of a measured whole, with its key; segments that do not sum to the whole are a construction error | — | S7 | done |
| **C3** | vertical `tabs::Tabs` gains group headings and per-item reading + bounded trend, plus a stated absence for a group with no entries (`with_absences`) | — | S7 | done |
| **P1** | `PressureKind::{Gpu, Accelerator}` and `gpu_pressure` / `accelerator_pressure` in both built-in themes | — | S9 | done |
| **D1** | `drivers/accelerator/` class with its trait in `lib/abi/src/driver/accelerator.rs`, bound through the ordinary discovery-match path | — | S8 | done |
| **Q1** | `VOLUME_IO_STATS` — ungated, per volume: bytes, ops, `busy_ns`, read/write `wait_ns` | `plans/FIX-IO.md` per-device counters | S8 | done |
| **Q2** | `VOLUME_IO_QUEUE` — `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`, audited: `in_flight`, queue depth sum + samples, the class budget in force | `plans/FIX-IO.md` per-device counters | S8 | done |
| **Q3** | `GPU_DEVICE_STATS` — `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`: the device's `busy_ns`/`idle_ns`, its memory, its `AccelCaps` and its scan-out mode | `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` accel path | S8 | done |
| **Q4** | `ACCEL_DEVICE_STATS` — `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`: `busy_ns`/`idle_ns`, device memory, `in_flight` | D1 | S8 | planned |
| **M1** | `CPU_INFO` moves `Cadence::Static` → `EverySample`, so the live clock is a live reading | — | S5 | done |
| **M2** | Q1–Q4 enter the cadence table on `EverySample`, each degrading only the field it backs | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 | S5 | in progress — Q1–Q3 landed with their queries; Q4 remains |
| **M3** | The machine report: `WatchMachine` and the `MachineReport` frame on `SWITCHBOARD_ENDPOINT`, projected from each sample while the session's System Monitor screensaver is up | — | S14 | done |
| **V1** | `view/resources/`: the shared pane frame and the grouped per-device rail, its length discovered rather than declared | A1, F1, C3 | S4 | done |
| **V2** | CPU pane — hero busy trace and the per-core grid (trace, busy share, live clock, performance class) | V1, M1 | S4 | done |
| **V3** | Memory pane — composition bar, the pressure banner with its recommended relief and refusal kinds, the bounded-cache reclaim ledger | V1, C2 | S4 | done |
| **V4** | Storage pane — one entry per *device* (mounts grouped by serving block endpoint), its volumes and their mount points, capacity, medium and the bucketed health block; the service-and-queue block fills from Q1/Q2 | V1, C1, Q1, Q2 | S4 | done |
| **V5** | Interface pane — duplex rate trace from its own counters, the served window stated beside the figure, link, counters, stack | V1, C1 | S4 | done |
| **V6** | Graphics pane — the frame-work breakdown, the compositing path, the device; self-report suppression preserved | V1, P1, Q3 | S4 | done |
| **V7** | Accelerator pane — reports what discovery knows (node, class, match keys, unbound); readings fill from Q4. Also brings the virtio-MMIO/PCI **accelerator probe** and the driver-store bundle: D1's classifiers put a real PCI or device-tree accelerator in the tree, but a virtio accelerator's type is only visible to a runtime slot probe, and the rail is that probe's only consumer | V1, P1, D1, Q4 | S4 | planned |
| **V8** | Machine group panes — identity and uptime, seats and census, authority with limits and live usage | V1 | S4 | done |
| **V9** | Tasks amendments — Owner and Core columns | A1 | S4 | done |
| **V10** | Top-consumers block on the CPU, Memory and storage panes, stating that a sum of tasks is not the device's total | V2, V3, V4 | S4 | done |
| **X1** | Delete `view/{background,pressure,activities}.rs` and their tests; `PressureClock` and the cause model move to V3's banner, the group model to V9's grouping | V3, V9 | S10 | done |
| **X2** | Delete `view/{system,system_data}.rs`, the `PageLine` vocabulary and `SystemReport`'s `cores`/`memory`/`compositor` fact vectors | V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V8 | S10 | done |
| **X3** | Re-point `view/tasks.rs`'s three board citations at `plans/switchboard/01-tasks.png` | V9 | S10 | done |
| **X4** | Rewrite `docs/src/desktop/switchboard.md` — it describes the section set | V1–V10 | S10 | done |
| **R1** | `plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md`: re-point the tray capsule, the long-press route and T13's quick-actions menu at the surviving sections | A1 | S11 | done |
| **R2** | `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`: enter C1–C3 in the control families with their settle-point and damage obligations | C1, C2, C3 | S11 | done |
| **Z1** | Responsiveness verticals — selection performs no I/O, a paint reads nothing, an input burst yields one paint, a fresh sample damages only what moved | V1–V8 | S12 | done |
| **V11** | Pixel scrolling: every section's list and the navigation rail laid out unscrolled at natural size and shown through a `ScrollView`; the rail scrolls behind a bar of its own; the pressure banner stands above the flow it used to be counted into; the Resources command rail lights an Edge Wake while its pane is displaced | V1, V3 | S2, S3, S4 | done |
| **V12** | Tasks' commands are each row's own menu — an `OpenMenu` on a secondary press or Enter, answered by one `MenuClosed` acting on the task by `ProcId` — and the `ACTIONS` rail, the shown/total count, the grouping `ComboBox` and the Auto-refresh `Toggle` are retired | V9 | S4 | done |
| **V13** | A storage entry reads its device's busy share; every byte trace is drawn against the least power of two seating its window's peak, stated on the hero's axis | V4, V5 | S4, S5 | done |
| **V14** | The window is cut from the icon bar's glass, frosted deeper: its bare ground at `chrome_alpha` over `window_backdrop_blur`, everything on it solid, the blur asked for before the first frame and on every desktop change | — | S1 | done |
| **V15** | One row per program: every record the kernel marks sandboxed is folded into the row of the owner its parent link names — CPU, memory and disk summed — and the task count, the tray's top task, the stopped count and the top consumers are taken from the folded rows | — | S4 | done |
| — | Where the composition lives, and the `testkit` contrast fixture | — | S1 | done |
| — | The location band: breadcrumb, band summary slot, section list, one `select_section_index` transition, no permanent resource band | — | S2 | done |
| — | The section frame resolver, the fixed drop order and `PRIMARY_FLOOR` | — | S3 | done |
| — | The shared selection-identity rule, the one list walk (`ListInfo::offer`), `PressureClock`, `FaultClock`, the `ProcId` crash match | — | S4 | done |
| — | Recovery's interior: fault cards, detail tabs, impact stack, action rail, resolved tally | — | S4 | done |
| — | The eight controls this surface already contributed to `lib/controls` | — | S7 | done |

**A1 through X4 are one change, and it is a large one.** A1 deletes four
sections, so every pane that absorbs their readings has to exist in the same
tree, and the four sections' own test modules go with them — the bulk of the
change is `view/{background,pressure,activities,system,system_data}.rs` and
their tests plus the references to `Section::{Jobs,Pressure,Activities,System}`,
`SystemReport`, `SystemPage`, `JobSummary`, `ActivitySummary` and
`PressureCause` in `view/mod_tests.rs`, `view/test_support.rs`, `panel_tests.rs`
and `model_tests.rs`. Plan it as one change over several sittings against a
branch, not as one sitting: a partially built Resources section cannot be
landed, because A1 leaves the surface with no home for the readings it deletes.

The reference storyboard is `plans/switchboard/`:

| Board | Shows |
|---|---|
| `00-map.png` | the three sections, and every reading traced to its query |
| `01-tasks.png` | Tasks — the table and its per-task trace |
| `02-cpu.png` | Resources → CPU, with the per-core grid |
| `03-memory.png` | Resources → Memory, with the pressure banner |
| `04-disk.png` | Resources → a volume: its rates, capacity and bucketed health |
| `05-network.png` | Resources → an interface |
| `06-graphics.png` | Resources → Graphics (compositor work, then the device) |
| `07-accelerator.png` | Resources → the accelerator slot, and what it costs |
| `08-recovery.png` | Recovery |
| `09-theme-and-shed.png` | the light theme, and the narrow window's shed order |

## S1 — Where the composition lives — done

The Switchboard *screen* is application-specific composition, so it lives in
the application: `userland/gui/switchboard/src/view/`, one module per
section over a shared frame module. `lib/controls` holds only controls any
surface may reuse. There is no `lib/controls::switchboard`.

The controls' heavier-contrast test fixture is reachable outside the crate
through the `test-support` feature (`tairix_controls::testkit`), so the
view's render tests exercise the same two contrast axes as the controls
without a second copy of the fixture.

Resources is large enough to want its own directory: `view/resources/`, one
module per pane over a shared pane frame, reached through the one
`SectionView` dispatch like any other section. A pane is not a section.

The window is drawn on `WINDOW_GROUND` (`SurfaceGround::Frosted`): its bare
ground lets the blurred desktop through at the icon bar's weight, and
everything laid on it — the rail's entries, the table's rows, every block,
card, tile and control — is solid. The one
constant decides both the pixels (`ThemeRegistry::active_on`) and the blur the
service asks for (`Theme::backdrop_blur`). The window manager's frame and title
bar stay opaque.

## S2 — Chrome: the navigation rail — done, band retired

The window is decorated **server-side** by the window manager (see
`plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md`): title bar, window commands, frame and resize
grabber are the compositor's, drawn around the client. Switchboard draws no
chrome of its own — its content is the whole client, starting with the
navigation rail — and resizes only by re-mapping its region on
`WindowEvent::Resized`. Those arrive one per pointer sample of a resize
grab, so they are read through the shared folding stream
(`tairix_window::WindowEvents`) and a whole drag costs one re-map.

Down the leading edge sits the **navigation rail**: one vertical `Tabs`
strip, owned by the shell rather than by any section, listing every subject
the surface can show in `RailGroup` order — `TASKS`, then the resource groups
(`RESOURCES`, `STORAGE`, `NETWORK`, `GRAPHICS`, `MACHINE`), then `RECOVERY`.
Each entry carries its own reading and a bounded `Chart` of it, so the rail
states what every subject is doing whichever one is on show.

- **The rail is the whole switcher, and is never shed.** It is the only route
  between subjects, so a drop order that could take it away would strand the
  reader; it is carved in `compute_layout` before any section frame, and
  `MIN_WIN_WIDTH`/`WIN_WIDTH` include `RAIL_WIDTH`. Pointer and keyboard run
  the one `select_section_index` transition.
- **The cursor is the choice.** Moving the rail cursor selects as it moves —
  a rail entry names the pane the reader is reading — rather than waiting for
  a second key to confirm.
- **The subject on show is lit immediately.** `select_section` marks the rail
  from the cached `rail_subjects`, so a section change never leaves the
  previous entry lit for a sampling interval.
- **A rail taller than its column scrolls, a pixel at a time.** The strip is
  laid out unscrolled at its natural height and painted, hit and reported
  through a `ScrollView`. Its own `ScrollBar` is carved from the rail
  column's trailing edge only while the strip overflows, so the pane beside
  it never narrows; the strip's height does not depend on its width, so
  carving the bar cannot change whether one is needed. The wheel scrolls the
  rail while the pointer is over its column and the section's list
  everywhere else. Every subject change — a press, the keyboard cursor, a
  host's `select_section` — scrolls the subject's entry into view with the
  heading that introduces it. The host's route carries no rail geometry, so
  the transition only asks: the paint draws the rail at the revealed offset
  (`Switchboard::rail_model`, derived and never stored) and the next round
  stores it, and every transition that asks already reports the whole
  client. A bar that stops being drawn drops any press it held.
- **What is lit follows the pointer, not the content.** A round — a pointer
  event, a key, or a refresh — that moved the section's list or the rail under
  a pointer that did not move replays the resting pointer
  (`Switchboard::rehover`): the rail's strip re-derives its hover, and the
  section offers the move to the lines shown at both the old and the new
  offset (`ListInfo::offer`), so a line carried clean out of view goes out too.
  Only the line left and the line lit report. A resize that clamps the offset
  inside `render` (S4's relayout hook) is not a round and replays nothing, so
  the hover there waits for the next motion.
- **Empty groups still state themselves.** `STORAGE` and `NETWORK` are the
  only groups that can be empty; each states whether the query was refused or
  simply found nothing, in its own rail position.

**The location band is retired**, and with it the `Breadcrumb` trail, the
`ListMenu` `IconButton`, the section `Menu`, `BandSummary`/`BandLayout`/
`resolve_band`/`band_height`, and the Resources `band_combo` that existed only
to survive a shed rail. The retired footer's "Sampling every 1.0 s" is gone
too — it was false as well as redundant, since the cadence is 2 s.

**The surface opens on Resources, showing the processor.** `Switchboard::new`
already starts on `Section::Resources`, whose first device is the CPU; the
taskbar's ordinary tray tap asks for `CommandSection::Resources` to match. A
long press still asks for `Recovery`, which is an explicit destination.

## S3 — The section frame — done, Resources anatomy added

Every section is the same anatomy, resolved once in `view/frame.rs` and drawn
into by all of them, so no section restates the geometry:

```
 sidebar? |            header?                                  |
          |  primary   |  detail?   |  impact?   |  rail?       |
          |            footer?                                  |
```

- `sidebar` — a leading navigation column (Resources' device rail).
- `header` — the section's own instruments and filters.
- `primary` — the master list, table or pane. Always present, and the only
  section region the primary column's `ScrollBar` governs. It scrolls a pixel
  at a time: its list is laid out unscrolled from its viewport's top at
  natural size (`ListInfo`), painted and hit through a `ScrollView`, and one
  walk (`ListInfo::offer`) feeds the Tasks rows and the fault cards the event
  mapped into that layout, so a line the reader has scrolled part-way past is
  cut by the viewport's edge rather than squeezed, and a pointer over a
  pinned band above the list reaches no hidden part of a line. A detent is
  `WHEEL_STEP` logical pixels and a line step is the list's own pitch.
- `detail` — the pane describing the primary's selected item.
- `impact` — the narrow stack of readings *about* that subject (Recovery's
  per-task CPU, memory, disk and network).
- `rail` — the trailing `ActionRail` of commands for the selected item.
- `footer` — the section's status line and its section-wide controls.

Each section declares the regions it wants in *logical* lengths as a
`SectionAnatomy`; `resolve_section_frame` resolves them against the client
and, when the window is too narrow to seat them all, drops the optional ones
in one fixed order — `detail`, then `impact`, then `rail`, then `sidebar` —
so `primary` always survives and the drop order is a property of the frame
rather than a per-section improvisation.

**`primary` has a floor, and shedding honours it.** A region is shed when
`primary` would fall below `SectionAnatomy::PRIMARY_FLOOR` — the one pixel
below which it would not exist. No row carries commands of its own: every
command stands in an anchored rail, whose width the anatomy already declares,
so there is no row strip for the floor to protect.

`panel.rs`'s `MIN_WIN_WIDTH`/`MIN_WIN_HEIGHT` stay the panel's *readability*
floor rather than becoming derived values: the floors need the theme's
control metrics and the live `Scale`, so they cannot produce a `const`. The
two are *tied* to the anatomies by a test asserting the minimum window keeps
every section's `primary` at its declared floor and keeps every sidebar and
rail any section asks for. `MIN_WIN_WIDTH` is **not** raised to the width at
which every optional column fits: shedding is the drop order working as
designed, and enlarging the window until shedding stops would be mitigation,
not a floor.

**Resources sheds its sidebar's route into the band, never its
destinations.** When the device rail is shed, the band grows a `ComboBox`
naming the current device, whose list is the same device set the rail held
(`09-theme-and-shed.png`). Losing the rail must not lose a pane, so the
control that replaces it is a control, not an omission.

An `ActionRail`'s column is one width wherever it appears
(`frame::ACTION_RAIL_WIDTH`), so a reader who learns where the commands sit
in one section finds them in the same place in the next.

**A command rail beside a scrolled list lights an Edge Wake.** The rail is
anchored while the list beside it moves, so Resources' `DEVICE ACTIONS` rail
carries an Edge Wake down its leading edge exactly while the pane is scrolled
away from its start; Recovery's rail, beside fault cards, carries none, and
Tasks has no rail (`SectionView::wake_rail` names the rail, or none). Nothing stores it: the paint lights it
(`ActionRail::with_edge_wake`) from the offset it draws the list at, so no
clamp or host transition can leave it disagreeing with the list, and a round
that moved the list to or from its start reports the rail — one scrolling on
from an already-displaced offset does not.

Each section is a struct in its own module owning its view models, its
retained controls, its cursor and its section-private overlays, reached
through one `SectionView` dispatch (`anatomy`, `adopt`, `render`,
`on_pointer`, the content/action cursors, `activate_focused`, and the primary
column's scroll extent). `view/mod.rs` holds the window frame, the chrome,
the scroll model, the region focus policy and the one `match` that names the
active section — never a second copy of a section's behaviour.

## S4 — The three sections — planned

**Three sections, one per question a reader arrives with:** what is running,
what is this machine doing, what broke. `Section` and the wire
`CommandSection` both carry exactly `Tasks`, `Resources`, `Recovery`.

Every other surface the old design gave a section to is absorbed into the one
that was already about it:

| Absorbed | New home |
|---|---|
| Background (jobs) | no job registry exists anywhere in the system, so the section had no rows to show. Returns as a `Jobs` tab and a `Type` column on Tasks when a registry lands — not as a section. |
| Pressure | a banner on the Resources pane it names, carrying the same recommended relief and the same refusal kinds. A cause and its resource were never two places. |
| Activities | window grouping is the session's business, not the monitor's, so the section goes and the table gains no grouping of its own: owner, state and core are columns a reader sorts by. The one fold is not a grouping: a parser sandbox worker *is* its owner, re-entered as a capability-empty child, so it is counted in its owner's row (V15). |
| System | its four graphable pages *are* the Resources panes. Identity, Sessions and Permissions become a **Machine** group in the same device rail. Services and Power stated an absent interface and still do (S6). |

Nothing with a reading behind it is dropped. `PressureClock` and the
per-resource cause model survive as the banner's source; the fault model,
`FaultClock` and the crash-record match survive unchanged in Recovery.

**Selection must survive a refresh.** A master/detail section is unusable if
the detail pane changes object every time a sample lands, so every view model
carries the model's stable identity for its item and a section re-resolves
its selection against that identity after `adopt` (`view::resolve_selection`),
dropping it only when the item genuinely went away. A row number would
silently re-point at a different subject the moment one above it left. The
view never interprets an identity; it only compares.

### Tasks (`01-tasks.png`)

- **header** — none. The section claims `header_height: 0`: the table's own
  column headings are pinned inside the table, so every pixel above the rows
  belongs to the rows.
- **primary** — a sortable `TableHeader` over `TableRow`s: Task (its
  `IconKind` and name), Owner, State, Activity (a per-task CPU `Chart`
  sparkline), CPU, Core, Memory, Disk, Network. Every column is a *reading*
  about the task; what may be done to it is the rail's business. Sorting is
  the header's and stable, so rows it cannot separate keep the order the
  sample reported. `COLUMN_WEIGHTS` is the one
  definition of the column geometry: the heading, the cells and the
  sparkline's own rect (`TableRow::cell_rects`) all read it.
- **one row per program** — the sampler folds each record carrying
  `PROCESS_FLAG_SANDBOXED` into the row of the owner its `parent_proc_id`
  names, summing its CPU, memory and disk, before anything is counted or
  ranked; a worker whose owner is absent from the sample keeps its own row.
- **rail, footer** — none. A task's commands are its row's own menu, and the
  table follows every sample: there is nothing to hold, count or group.
- **the row's menu** — a secondary press on a row selects it and asks for its
  menu at the press (`SectionView::context_press`, reached only for that
  press); Enter or Space on the row the cursor is on does the same, the screen
  scrolling the row into view before anchoring the menu on it
  (`SectionOutcome::TaskMenu`). The menu is the desktop's chain
  (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md`), declared by `task_menu.rs` and titled with the
  task's name, or `Task` where the name is not admissible label text, so no
  process can make itself unreachable here by its choice of name. Its rows, in
  `COMMANDS` order and grouped by dividers: Switch to, Reveal window | Pause,
  Resume, Lower priority | Open logs | Force quit, the last
  `AppMenuRole::Destructive`. A row's id is its command's position, so the
  menu's shape never moves; a command the task cannot take is disabled with
  its reason (`TaskRefusal::reason`), which the desktop shows as a tip.
- **cursor** — the content cursor spans the one header stop (the column
  headings), then the rows. `SectionView::focus_row` maps a cursor stop back
  to the row it names (`None` for the headings), keeping the scroll-into-view
  arithmetic in `view/mod.rs` as the one definition; a sample leaves the
  cursor, and the heading it rests on, where the reader put them.

**The census tiles, the filter strip, the search field, the command rail and
the footer are retired.** The tiles' readings are the Resources section's
subject, the strip's absent kinds needed a job registry and a service manager
that do not exist, and a task's commands belong to its row. Every adopted row
is shown, so `arrange` sorts the whole set.

**Owner and Core are real columns, and stay.**
`ProcessRecord` carries `uid`, `gid` and the CPU the task is dispatched on, so
a busy core in the CPU pane can be traced to the task sitting on it, and
per-principal accounting is visible on a machine with many users.

**The commands act on the task, never on a row.** A `ProcId` — the task's
stable, never-reused instance identity — is what the selection remembers and
what a menu's commands name (`SwitchboardAction::Task { proc_id, .. }`),
because samples keep landing while a menu is up and a row index would name
whichever task slid into that position. The panel holds the one open it is
owed an answer for (`Panel::menu_closed`), drops an answer naming any other,
and forgets it with the window.

`TaskAuthority` carries one `TaskVerdict` per command, reached in `model.rs`
where the task's lifecycle state and the caller's authority are both known.
The state is asked first, because its refusal is the true one: an exited task
refuses everything, a paused one refuses Pause and Lower priority, a running
one refuses Resume, one already at the background level refuses Lower
priority — and only a command the state permits is refused for want of
`PROC_CONTROL`. A menu row cannot draw the Authority Mark (the wire has no
field for it, `plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D10), so the reason is what tells the two
refusals apart. `apply_action` re-checks the verdict in the model held when
the answer lands, so a command the task no longer permits, or one never
offered, is not carried out. `TaskControl::Reveal` is the same request of the
session as `Switch` — raising the window is how this system shows a reader
where it is. `TaskControl::OpenLogs` is permanently refused: no
capability-gated query for a task's own log entries exists (S6).

**A row wears no activity seam.** An activity in a control's state paints a
Heat Seam along its whole lower edge, which under a table row reads as an
orange rule beneath every working task rather than as a reading about one. A
task's activity is shown in the Activity column instead, as the sparkline the
heading promises; the row's state carries only its pressure (a Pressure Rail
in the leading gutter) and its recovery posture (a Signal Bead).

**Disk** is a real measurement: `TaskMeters` (`model.rs`) deltas each task's
`io_bytes_read + io_bytes_written` against its own previous reading over
`Sample::elapsed_ns`. A first sample, a task first seen this sample, and an
unmeasured interval each yield no rate (a cumulative total is not a rate); a
counter that did not move over a real interval is a genuine `0`. **Activity**
plots the same store's bounded per-task CPU ring (`TASK_HISTORY_LEN`, which is
`MAX_CHART_SAMPLES`), keyed by `ProcId` so a recycled pid cannot inherit a
dead task's history, and rebuilt from each sample so an exited task leaks
neither its history nor its counters. **Network** has no interface at all (S6)
and renders the explicit unmeasured mark.

### Resources (`02`–`07`)

The section that replaces the old System page list. Resources is **one pane
per resource device**, instrument-led: the old design rendered per-core load,
memory detail and compositor cost as `Vec<SystemFact>` key/value text, which
is the defect this section exists to fix. A resource's shape over time is the
reading; a fact list cannot carry it.

- **sidebar — the device rail.** One entry per *discovered device*, grouped:
  `Resources` (CPU, Memory), `Storage` (one per storage device), `Network`
  (one per managed interface), `Graphics` (the compositor), `Accelerators`
  (one per matching hardware-tree node, S8), then `Machine` (Identity &
  uptime, Sessions & seats, Permissions & limits). Each device entry carries
  its name, its current reading and its own bounded trace, so the rail is a
  live summary of the whole machine and the pane is the detail of one part of
  it. The `Machine` group's entries carry no trace: they are facts, not rates,
  and the absence of an instrument is what says so.

  The rail is the *sidebar* region, so it is the vertical `Tabs` control
  (S7) — a sidebar is not a second selection control. Cores are deliberately
  **not** rail entries: the CPU pane shows every core at once, so a per-core
  rail would state the same readings twice and push the devices off screen.

  **The rail's length is discovered, never declared.** Twelve cores, four
  disks and three interfaces is the design case; a hundred-core machine with
  a dozen disks gets a scrolling rail, not a truncated one, and no entry
  count is a compile-time constant.

  **The rail is the one region that wears no plate**, because it is a list of
  destinations rather than a block of readings. Its selected entry lifts to the
  raised fill and marks its leading edge at the rail breadth, and its group
  headings read in the accent at the header role's size — the vocabulary
  `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §11.12 now states for every sidebar list, so
  no part of it is this surface's own. The section must not re-derive the
  strip's keyboard cursor from its own selection each sample: the cursor is the
  reader's, `Tabs::restate` carries it, and pinning it to the selection lit a
  focus ring around the selected entry permanently and snapped a reader's
  cursor back whenever a reading moved.

- **header — the pane's hero.** The device's headline reading, its context
  line, and its instrument: a `Chart` trend where the reading is a rate (CPU,
  disk, network, graphics) and a `Track` where it is a fraction of a measured
  whole (memory, capacity). The choice belongs to the reading, not the
  renderer. A rate has no fixed ceiling to fill a bar against.

  **The figure leads and the unit trails quietly**, so the hero reads as one
  number rather than a sentence: the value is set in `TextRole::Display`
  against a body-size unit on the *same baseline*. The boards draw the figure
  about 2.9 body cap-heights, so of the two rungs that could carry it —
  `Heading` (133%) and `Display` (250%) — `Display` is the near one and
  `Heading` reads as barely emphasised beside its own unit. The role's job is
  stated as "the one figure a surface is built around", which is what a pane's
  headline reading is; it needs no new rung, and 250% seats its line plus both
  context lines inside the hero's four-row band.

  **The hero carries both instruments, and its figure opens the plate.** The
  boards draw a trace beside the reading *and* a share bar under the context
  lines, on the processor pane and the memory pane alike, so `HeroInstrument`
  carries a trend and a track together rather than choosing between them —
  memory had a bar and no trace, which is why its pane read as the odd one out.
  A tile with no label claims no line for one, so the figure starts at the top
  of the plate instead of a line lower than the block it leads.

  **The figure therefore carries no unit of its own.** A value spelled `18%`
  against a `% busy` unit renders `18% % busy`, so a hero's figure comes from
  a formatter that yields digits alone (`whole_percent`, `pixel_parts`) while a
  reading that stands by itself — a rail entry, a per-core cell, a consumer
  row — keeps the spelled form. The magnitude prefix belongs to the unit for
  the same reason: `4.2` against `M px`, never `4.2M` against `px`.

**One fold, once per sample — a trace's x-axis is time.** `RollingMeters::record`
folds every side, including each storage device, each interface and the display
path; `build_resource_report` only *reads* the meters, which the type now says.
Folding in the builder advanced a trace on every *rebuild*, and a rebuild
happens on each frame, seat and owner-bundle report as well as each sample — so
the display path's trace ran in bursts while the compositor was busy and
stalled while it was quiet, and dragged the storage and interface traces along
with it. A trace whose axis is "reports since I started watching" cannot be read
against a clock, and the `-Ns`/`now` markers below it would be a fabricated span.

**A trace states its own window at both ends.** The axis row under a hero's
trace carries how far back the box reaches, what its extent means, and that its
trailing edge is `now`, in one dimmer, smaller face — instrument furniture, not
a reading. The span is *derived* from the chart's window and the sampler's own
cadence (64 slots x 2 s = 128 s), never the boards' design-time `-60 s`: a label
claiming a minute over a two-minute window is a fabricated reading. The removed
footer's "Sampling every 1.0 s" was that same defect — the cadence is 2 s.

**A hero's figure carries no unit and its column fits its own text.** A byte
reading and the whole it is a share of are both scaled to *that whole's* unit
(`byte_parts`), so the pair reads as one quantity: `8.5` against `/ 16.0 GiB`,
and half a gibibyte of sixteen is `0.5`, never `512` against a whole in another
unit. The reading column is measured from its widest context line rather than
taken as a third of the hero, which truncated
`53% committed - 7.4 GiB available` mid-reading.

**A plated block claims one row past its content.** Its rows are inset from the
top of its band, so a plate exactly as tall as its content ran the last row over
its own rim and margin — which is what put the memory hero's share bar outside
its plate.

**A block carries no explanatory note.** The prose under each block ("a sum of
tasks is not the device's total", "swap has no plaintext mode") is gone, along
with `PaneBlock::note` and the cadence footer. A *stated absence* is not such a
note and stays: it is a reading about a reading, not an explanation of one.

**Every plate carries a margin, and that margin is the only gap.**
`block::plate` insets itself from the band the flow hands it
(`block::plate_margin`, half a control gap a side), so two blocks in adjacent
slots leave one whole control gap between their rims. The flow therefore
divides its columns and its per-core grid *evenly*, with no gap arithmetic of
its own: a slot's gap is its plate's margin, in both directions, from one
definition. Slots that abut with plates drawn to their edges is what made the
rims touch down the pane while the grid across it was correctly spaced.

**A per-core cell is three rows, not a `MetricTile`.** The name with the class
badge opposite, the trace between, then the busy share with the live clock
opposite — measured from their own faces so the readings sit on the cell's
bottom line and the trace takes what is left. A tile stacks label, reading and
detail from the top, which drew the trace across the readings and left a third
of the cell empty beneath them. The class badge is a compact rounded box, not a
capsule: its rim and letter carry it in the class's tone over the plate's own
ground, because at badge size a wash is indistinguishable from the plate and a
capsule reads as a pill of prose. Its corner takes the theme's corner
*proportion* — a control's radius over a control's height — since the length
itself is half a badge's side, which is a capsule.

**One block anatomy, shared by all three sections** (`view/block.rs`). The
boards draw every framed thing the same way, so it is defined once: a
hairline-rimmed plate a step lighter than the section behind it
(`surface_raised` as a `ChromeLayer::Plate`), under a small-caps accent title
at `TextRole::SectionHeader` with a hairline rule. The hero, every pane detail
block, a per-core cell, a fault card and the fault's fact
and timeline blocks are all that one block; so are the action columns' titled
plates, which is what retired the `Panel` they used to sit in — a header band
at control height with a dominant rail and a signal bead is a different
anatomy, and `Panel` is shared with the terminal, the taskbar and the file
manager, so retuning its caption would retune those.

The paint and the layout read one definition of where a block's content lands
(`block::content_rect`, `block::titled_content`, `block::title_height`), so a
command is hit-tested and focused exactly where it was drawn.

A block whose body brings its own plates draws none of its own and its title
draws no rule (`BlockBody::self_plating`): the per-core grid's cells already
carry the rim, and a plate around the grid would nest one inside another. The
Recovery detail pane is the other case — it wears no plate at all, because it
*is* the detail region and the fault's identity line is its heading; it used
to be a titled `Panel` whose caption was the fault's name *and* draw that name
again inside itself.

- **primary — the pane's own detail**, per device:

  - **CPU** (`02-cpu.png`) — the per-core grid: one cell per logical CPU
    carrying the core's own trace, its busy percentage, its live measured
    clock and its performance class. Then the processor fact columns, which
    include the ISA extensions a program may rely on: the *intersection* over
    every reported core, because a heterogeneous machine schedules a task on
    whichever core is free, so an extension only the performance cores
    implement is one no unpinned program may use. Zero bits reads as
    unmeasured, never as "this CPU implements none".
    "Unplated" is the *tile's* property — `MetricTile::unplated()`, no Alloy
    Plate and no padding of its own, so a core's name, trace and two readings
    share one surface instead of nesting a plate per reading. The **cell** is
    the block plate above, because in a
    grid of a dozen cores nothing else separates one core's figures from its
    neighbour's; the boards show that rim in both themes. The class badge is a
    toned, *outlined* `StatusPill` — orange `P`, green `E` — because a
    resting pill's wash is a few levels off the plate behind it and reads as
    nothing at badge size.
  - **Memory** (`03-memory.png`) — the composition bar (S7) answering *where
    did it go* in one row, then the memory and kernel fact columns, then the
    bounded-cache reclaim ledger.
  - **A storage device** (`04-disk.png`) — the service-and-queue block, the
    capacity and medium block, the volumes-and-mounts block, and the health
    block: every completion bucketed, with the status pill the buckets
    resolve to.

    **The entry is a device, never a mount** (a deliberate divergence from
    the board's "one pane per volume", which the readings do not support).
    `VOLUME_IO_STATS` reports the *device's* counters — every volume on one
    disk reads the same fold, which is why the record names the serving block
    endpoint beside the volume id — and the boot namespace projects one
    writable volume at `/` and at each flag-bearing subtree beneath it. So
    the mount table is grouped by serving endpoint before anything is folded:
    per mount, a disk's throughput is reported once per projection *and* once
    per partition, and its cumulative counters are deltaed against
    themselves — the second fold of one sample reads the first fold's own
    value as the interval's earlier end, derives nought and plots it, so the
    volume the machine runs from draws a flat trace and an idle rate. A
    volume the kernel publishes no serving device for has no shared counters
    to collapse and stands as its own entry with its capacity alone; a mount
    with no backing volume (the in-RAM layout directories) is view plumbing
    and no storage device. The volumes on a device, and the paths each is
    reachable at with its own mount flags, are the pane's own
    volumes-and-mounts block, so collapsing the rail loses nothing.
  - **An interface** (`05-network.png`) — link and addresses, counters and
    offloads, and the stack block (sockets, resolver, time servers, defence).
  - **Graphics** (`06-graphics.png`) — the frame-work breakdown, the
    compositing path, and the graphics device.
  - **An accelerator** (`07-accelerator.png`) — what the node's discovery
    genuinely reports, and the readings awaiting S8's query. `D1` landed the
    class, so `HwDeviceClass::Accelerator` exists and a real PCI or
    device-tree accelerator is classified as one; this pane brings the virtio
    slot probe that puts a *virtio* accelerator in the tree, because the rail
    is that probe's only consumer.
  - **Machine** — identity and uptime; the seats and logged-in census; the
    authority summary with the resource limits and their live usage.

- **A resource under pressure wears a banner on its own pane**, above the
  hero: the band, how long it has stood there, and the model's own recommended
  relief as a primary `Button`. The banner is pinned across the top of the
  pane and the flow scrolls beneath it, so the pressure and its relief stay in
  view however far the reader scrolls; the flow reserves no rows for it, and
  the one split (`ResourcesSection::pane_layout`) is what the paint, the
  scroll range and a refresh's report all read. A banner that comes or goes
  moves the flow and reports the pane; one whose words or relief moved
  reports its band. Where this session cannot take that relief the
  banner names which refusal — `not permitted` for want of the capability, the
  plain disabled treatment otherwise — while the command still fails closed at
  its button, to the keyboard as to the pointer. A resource recommending
  nothing says so instead of volunteering another command.

  A band's age has no interface behind it (nothing timestamps a band change),
  so `PressureClock` tracks when each resource entered its band — clocked off
  the monotonic uptime reading, sharing one `elapsed_since` definition with
  `FaultClock` — and forgets it the sample the band eases, so a resource that
  comes back under pressure is timed from its new band. With no uptime reading
  the age reads unmeasured, never a fabricated zero.

- **Top consumers.** The CPU, Memory and storage panes each carry the five
  tasks costing that resource most, from the per-task readings the process
  record already provides, so the pane and the Tasks table can never disagree.
  **Summing them is not the device's total** and the pane says so: filesystem,
  RAID and swap traffic belongs to no process. The interface pane has no such
  block — per-task network has no interface (S6) — and states that in words
  rather than showing an empty list, because an empty list reads as *none*.

- **A rail group with no entries states why, in its own rail position.** A
  heading is drawn by the entry that starts its group, so an empty group
  would vanish and leave a reader unable to tell a machine with no such
  device from a session refused the inventory. `Storage` and `Network` are
  the two that can be empty, and `ResourceReport`'s `storage_absent` /
  `interfaces_absent` carry the verdict the sample reached for each. The
  sidebar draws them through `Tabs::with_absences` (`TabGroupAbsence`:
  heading, one line, and the item index it precedes), which selects nothing,
  takes no keyboard cursor and shifts no item's index — so a statement drawn
  among the entries can never move the device a press lands on.

- **rail** — the commands for the *selected device*, seated in a `Panel`
  because `ActionRail` carries no caption of its own. Every action emits a
  typed view action the service authorises and applies; the view performs no
  privileged work. A refusal names its own kind: an action refused for want of
  a capability wears the Authority Mark, because acquiring the authority would
  make it available, while an action with no endpoint behind it is plainly
  disabled.

- **footer** — none. A trace states its own window on its hero's axis row, and
  a pane follows every sample.

- **cursor** — the banner's relief, then the action rail's commands. The
  device list is the navigation rail, a focus region of its own whose `Tabs`
  cursor is the choice (S2), so the content cursor never walks it too and no
  key has two meanings. The pane's flow has no stops: the reader scrolls it.

**How a pane is laid out, so every pane scrolls the same way.** A pane
compiles to a flat run of short, self-contained drawables, each knowing its
row, its row span and its column *before* any paint, so a paint allocates
nothing and lays nothing out — it walks the items the viewport covers. Spans
are fixed and width-independent, which is what makes the scroll range exact.
An item lays out at its natural size wherever the pane is scrolled to
(`pane::item_rect` takes no offset), so a hero scrolled half out of view keeps
its chart's full height and is cut by the viewport's edge. Two
consequences:

- **The blocks flow in one or two columns**, a `Half` block pairing with the
  next one and the pair advancing by the taller side. A `Full` block closes an
  unpaired half first, so a column can never overhang the block below it.
- **The per-core grid's cells-per-row is a *layout input* to the compile, not
  a constant**, because the grid re-wraps rather than squeezing: a pane too
  narrow for six cells draws fewer per row and scrolls. A width change
  therefore has to *recompile* the flow, and `SectionView::render` and
  `list_info` are both `&self` — so this needs one `&mut` relayout hook on
  `SectionView`, called from `Switchboard::render` before `sync_scroll`.
  Recompiling per paint instead is the §28 defect (work scaling with the
  surface rather than with the change).
- **A wrapped grid is *balanced*, and every cell of it is one size.** The
  column count is `ceil(n / ceil(n / most))`, so four cores in a pane three
  cells wide are two rows of two rather than a full row and a lone straggler,
  and balancing never costs an extra row. Each compiled row carries that
  column count and the paint divides by *it*, never by the row's own length,
  so a row that cannot be filled leaves its trailing slots empty instead of
  stretching. Deriving the width from the row is what drew one core three
  times its neighbours' width, which defeats the comparison the grid exists
  for.

**The memory composition's parts are the kernel's own memory classes.** One
part per non-zero `MemoryClass` — `Processes` (`UserAnon`), `File cache`,
`Page tables`, `Kernel`, `Device buffers` (`Dma`), `Compressed` — plus the
free remainder, which closes the whole exactly. `Σ class ≤ usable` holds in
the frame allocator, so the floored shares can never exceed the whole and the
bar is valid *by construction*: it cannot fail to draw.

Built from `KernelMemoryStats::user_resident_bytes` instead, it did fail. That
figure is a per-space count of *mappings*, so a shared frame counts once per
space and a user driver's MMIO window counts although it is no RAM; the named
shares summed past the whole under load, `CompositionBar::new` refused, and
the block stated an absence exactly when a reader most wanted it. The class
partition is the fix, and `MEMORY_CLASS_COUNT <= MAX_COMPOSITION_SEGMENTS` is
asserted at compile time, so a seventh class is a build error rather than a
composition that silently states an absence. A class holding nothing is
dropped rather than drawn as a nameable run of no width.

**A device command is labelled, not glyphed, and almost none has an
endpoint.** The vocabulary these rails need — scrub, trim, renew a lease, drop
a cache, unmount — has no shipped `IconKind`, and an icon with no built-in
glyph behind it is not one this desktop may draw (§10), so the rail is
labelled like the machine-actions rail already is. Of the commands the boards
name, only "sort tasks by *resource*" is a command this service can carry out:
it is a view transition, the same shape as the pressure card's "Show tasks".
Every other one is plainly disabled for want of an endpoint — never marked for
authority, because acquiring a capability would not make an absent endpoint
appear.

**Every rail entry with a rate behind it carries a trace, from the counters
this service deltas itself.** A storage device's figure is how busy it is —
Q1's `busy_ns` delta over the interval, the utilisation its service block
states — so it reads like the processor's entry, and how full it is stays the
capacity block's. Its trace is the throughput Q1's byte counters delta into.
An interface's figure is the rates query's own already-averaged reading —
which states its averaging window beside the figure, in the hero's context,
so nothing inherits it — and its trace is the interface's cumulative counters
over *this* service's sample interval, through the same fold a storage
device's uses. Its hero trends duplex for the same reason a device's does: a
rate has no fixed ceiling to fill a bar against. Memory's trace is its
committed share's own bounded history, recorded beside the CPU's through one
series definition, so a refused reading on either side never shortens the
other. Only the `Machine` group has no instrument, and that absence is what
says its readings are facts.

**A byte trace is drawn against the scale its own window needs.** A shared
fixed reference flattens ordinary traffic or clips a fast device — at a
gigabyte a second, a desktop disk's half a mebibyte a second drew under a
pixel — so `DeviceMeters` holds each device's rates as bytes per second and
`rate_trace` draws them against the least power of two at or above the
window's peak across both directions, never below `TRACE_FLOOR_BYTES_PER_SEC`
(64 KiB/s), under which one metadata write on an idle device would fill the
box. The busiest point in view reaches at least half the box, and the scale
comes back down once a burst scrolls out. The hero's axis row states it
(`rate_caption`, scale first so a truncated caption keeps it); across devices,
the figures beside the traces are what compare.

**A trace carries how it is tinted, and there is one definition of that.**
`Trace` is the type: `Absent`, `Single { role, samples, full_scale }`, or
`Duplex { inbound, outbound, into, out }` — so "opposing samples with no
opposing role" is unrepresentable — and `Trace::chart()` is the *only* place a
trace becomes a `Chart`. The rail entry (`build_rail`) and the pane hero
(`hero_body`) both call it, so storage and network cannot drift apart, and the
rail draws a storage device's writes as well as its reads. The rail's trailing
reading is the device's busy share.

Most devices read as their own resource, so their trace takes
`kind.signal_role()`. The exceptions carry what they actually mean: the Tasks
entry is `Workload` (a task census is what the machine is *running*, not
compute saturation — drawn in the compute hue it read as a second CPU trace
beside the real one), the Recovery entry is `Recovery` (it had borrowed the
thermal hue), storage is `Duplex(DiskRead, DiskWrite)` and an interface is
`Duplex(NetReceive, NetSend)` — its own pair, so a network pane still reads as
network while its directions separate. `RailTrace` is gone: it carried the
same points-plus-ceiling a `Trace::Single` does, so the two were one type.

**Both `06-graphics.png` mismatches are closed, and the trace's reference is
the frame's own screen.** The rail entry reads `damaged_px` — what changed on
screen — where the hero reads `blended_px`, the contributions blended to
resolve it; the two are orders of magnitude apart, so they are different
readings rather than one stated twice.

The trace plots the frame's damage as a permille of *that frame's*
`screen_px`. It is the only full scale a per-frame pixel count has, and it is
the one the hero's own context line already states the reading against
("3,200 of 2.07 M on screen"), so the instrument and the words cannot
disagree. The alternatives were rejected: the shared byte reference every
device trace plots against is the wrong dimension, and a rolling maximum over
the chart window would make an idle desktop's few-pixel jitter fill the box.
That a cursor-only frame plots near the bottom is the truth about a frame that
recomposed 0.15% of the screen — the hero carries the absolute counts, and the
trace exists to show *screen-scale* work: a window drag reads a few hundred
permille, a wallpaper change fills the box, and a desktop repainting the whole
screen every frame pins there, which is the pathology this pane exists to
expose. A sample carrying no report contributes no point rather than a nought
that would read as an idle frame.

**The Graphics pane is named for the display path, not for a GPU.** A
framebuffer-only or headless machine has no GPU and would read an empty *GPU*
pane — but it still composites, and that work is what a reader needs. So the
pane leads with the compositor's measured frame cost and treats the device as
one of its facts. The line that earns the block is **damaged px against
blended px against screen px** — "we blended 4.2 M pixels to change 3 200" —
with `Opaque copies`, `Rectangles`, `Present calls` and `Window furniture`
behind it. An idle frame reads *idle*, not a row of zeros pretending to be a
frame; a frame nobody has reported yet reads unavailable. **Counts of work
only:** no wall-clock figure rides this path, because a duration is neither
reproducible nor assertable.

That reading is the one this service does not sample. The session owns the
compositor, so it reports what its last frame cost
(`SwitchboardCommand::FrameReport`) over the command port it already sends the
seat report on, on that same discipline — only with a live consumer, only when
the counts changed, never blocking a frame path, a dropped stale report being
fine because the next frame re-sends a fresher one — **and never when the only
served content that landed was this service's own window**. A monitor must not
measure its own act of displaying: reporting a frame whose work was only the
panel painting the previous report re-excites another paint forever. The
session classifies presents by attested owner and suppresses a
Switchboard-only frame; real desktop work and chrome/idle settles still report.
The receiver validates it and refuses counts no compositor pass could have
produced, so the panel never renders a sender's arithmetic.

### Recovery (`08-recovery.png`) — done

Kept as its own section: triage is a different job from reading a resource,
and folding it into a table filter would lose the timeline, the crash snapshot
and the impact stack that make triage possible.

- **primary** — a `Card` per fault: name, what happened, and how long ago.
- **detail** — the fault's identity, a `StatusPill` naming its impact, a
  `FactList` (status, age, recommendation), then a `Tabs` strip over three
  pages: Timeline (the marks this service observed), Crash Snapshot (the
  kernel's `CRASH_RECORD` — fault class, distance from its anchor, access
  direction, owning uid/gid, `pc`/`sp`/`fp`, every named register and every
  backtrace frame), and Logs (no interface, stated).
- **impact** — a stack of unplated `MetricTile`s for the faulting task's CPU,
  memory, disk and network; network is always unmeasured (S6).
- **rail** — `RECOVERY ACTIONS`, carrying only the commands this service
  backs: Restart, Soft quit, Save crash record, and Force with its
  confirmation posture or the Authority Mark.
- **footer** — the resolved-fault count, carried in the model because only
  something folding one sample into the next can see a fault clear.

A section whose master list is `Card`s makes its selection through the one
shared list walk (`ListInfo::offer`, which the Tasks rows use too): it offers
the pointer event, mapped into the list's layout, to every card the viewport
shows and reports whichever answered along with its own `CardAction`. A body
press selects the card, so pressing a card opens its detail; a footer click
selects it *and* resolves that button's command, so a command can never act
on a subject other than the card that offered it.

The crash record is matched to its fault by `ProcId` and nothing else: a
numeric pid is reused, so matching on one could attribute a dead task's crash
to a live task that inherited its number. A fault with no record says so
plainly and does *not* wear the unmeasured mark — a stopped or unresponsive
task has faulted without ever raising a user fault.

A fault's age has no interface behind it either, so the service tracks when it
first saw each task faulted, keyed by `ProcId`, clocked off the monotonic
uptime reading, pruned the first sample the fault clears, and counting each
pruned entry as the resolved tally.

## S4a — The two rail subjects that are not devices — done

The rail lists more than devices, so `RollingMeters::record` folds two more
series once per sample, on the same clock as every other trace:

- **Tasks** reads the process population, and its trace is that count against
  the largest this session has seen (`LiveMeters::process_peak`). A count has
  no capacity to be a permille share of, so the trace states its own ceiling
  through `Chart::with_full_scale`; a high-water only grows, so the box means
  the same thing from one sample to the next, where a ceiling refitted per
  window would redraw the same history differently every time it rolled.
- **Recovery** reads the number of stopped processes, and its trace is that
  count as a share of the population — already a permille, so it needs no
  stated ceiling.

An unread process list arrives as an empty one, so neither series records a
point when `DegradedField::ProcessList` is degraded: plotting its nought would
show a real population collapsing to zero and back.

## S5 — What the service samples — planned

The staged cadence (`Cadence::EverySample` / `Memory` / `Inventory` /
`Static`) is the existing design and stays: a reading is issued on the tier
its subject actually moves at. Each reading is its own sampled field,
capability-gated at the query, degrading exactly the field it backs and
nothing else. A field the sampler could not read carries an `Absence` saying
*which* — a scope the caller does not hold reads `not permitted`, a query that
simply did not answer reads `unavailable` — because those are different
statements to a reader.

The sample set gains S8's queries, all on `EverySample` because each is a rate
source whose delta is the reading:

| Query | Tier | What it backs |
|---|---|---|
| `VOLUME_IO_STATS` | `EverySample` | a volume's throughput, IOPS, utilisation and await |
| `VOLUME_IO_QUEUE` | `EverySample` | a volume's in-flight count and mean queue depth |
| `GPU_DEVICE_STATS` | `EverySample` | the graphics device's busy share, memory, `AccelCaps` and scan-out mode |
| `ACCEL_DEVICE_STATS` | `EverySample` | an accelerator's busy share, memory and queue |

**The panes need ten readings the sampler does not take yet, all of them
already served by an existing query.** S8's four are the ones that need *new*
queries; these need only sampling, and `lib/procinfo` already has a helper for
each, so the work is a `DegradedField`, a `Sample` field, a cadence entry and a
scope entry apiece:

| Reading | Tier | Scope | What it backs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_PRESSURE_BAND` | `EverySample` | ungated | the band and the banner, on a ceiling without kernel readings |
| `RECLAIM_STATS` | `Memory` | kernel | the composition's reclaimable share |
| `RAMZIP_STATS` | `Memory` | kernel | the compressed tier |
| `CACHE_LEDGERS` | `Memory` | kernel | the bounded-cache reclaim ledger |
| `NET_INTERFACE_COUNTERS` | `EverySample` | global | the interface counters block |
| `NET_SOCKETS` | `EverySample` | global | the socket census (folded to two counts as it walks) |
| `NET_RESOLVER_SERVERS` | `Inventory` | ungated | the stack block's resolvers |
| `NET_TIME_SERVERS` | `Inventory` | ungated | the stack block's time servers |
| `NET_STACK_DEFENCE` | `EverySample` | global | the SYN-backlog defence reading |
| `HARDWARE_TREE` | `Inventory` | hardware | the graphics device's identity |

`CACHE_REPORT` is **not** among them: it is how a process *submits* its own
cache rows, not a reading, so the ledger is `CACHE_LEDGERS` alone.

**Per-core busy is a `CPU_TIME_STATS` walk, not a new query.** The aggregate
the sampler already derives is a sum over per-CPU records that each carry
their own `busy_ns`/`idle_ns`, so walking the records instead of the existing
aggregate helper yields both readings from one read. A core first seen this
sample contributes no share — a cumulative total is not a share.

**The rail's traces and the per-core cells need a rolling store the sample
does not carry**, the per-device counterpart of `TaskMeters`: each core's own
bounded busy history, and each device's previous cumulative counters with the
rates they produce. Keyed on the subject's own identity (a CPU index, a
serving block endpoint or the volume standing in for one, an interface name)
rather than a rail position, and rebuilt from the sample so a detached device
leaks neither history nor counters. A byte rate is held as bytes per second
and scaled only when drawn (S4), so the scale can follow the window.

**`CPU_INFO` moves from `Static` to `EverySample`.** Its `current_freq_hz` is
a live reading and `CPU_INFO_FLAG_FREQ_MEASURED` exists precisely so a
consumer can trust or discard it; leaving the query on the static tier is what
made the old surface unable to show a live clock. The record is 88 bytes per
core, so a 128-core machine costs ~11 KB per sample — well inside the
transport, and the price of a live reading. The immutable part (model, class,
feature bits, reference clock) is re-read with it because the query is not
field-selective; if that ever matters, the fix is a request flag asking for
the live fields only, and `CpuInfoListRequest::flags` is already reserved for
one. It is not added before there is a measurement saying it is needed.

Per-task CPU history for the Activity sparkline is the service's own: a
bounded per-task ring of the CPU permille it already measures, keyed by the
task's stable identity, so a sparkline plots measurements rather than a shape.

## S6 — Readings with no interface yet

These render an honest unmeasured mark (`MeterValue::Unmeasured`, an
unmeasured cell, an empty `Chart`'s quiet plate, or a page stating its
reason), never a fabricated number. An empty list is *not* such a mark: it
reads as "none", so a reading with no interface states its absence in words.
Each needs its own interface before the surface can fill in; the layout
already has the slot.

| Reading | What is missing | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| per-task network bytes | no per-process socket accounting | the userland network service, which owns the sockets (`plans/NETWORK.md`) |
| per-task uptime / last-active | `ProcessRecord` carries no creation timestamp | the kernel process record |
| service list with state/CPU/memory | no service manager exists | `plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` |
| background jobs with progress | no job registry exists anywhere | unowned |
| temperature, AC/battery | no sensor or power-supply interface, and no driver to serve one | a `drivers/sensor/` class |
| log reading | the journal has an ingress path but no capability-gated read query | `plans/SYSLOG.md` |

Per-task **disk** bytes are measured: the kernel accounts the bytes each
process's own file reads and writes transfer, reported on `ProcessRecord`, and
the view derives a rate from the delta between samples.

## S7 — Controls this surface needs

Generic, reusable, and complete on landing (every state, both themes, the
heavier-contrast path, pointer and keyboard where interactive).

**Already in `lib/controls`, contributed by this surface — done.**
`nav::Breadcrumb` (a location trail whose trailing crumb is the current
location and is not activatable, eliding oldest-first with an activatable
ellipsis so the current location is never dropped); `metric::MetricTile` (an
optional identity icon, a label, a large reading with a quiet unit, an
optional detail line, and an optional `MetricInstrument` — a proportional
track reusing `MeterValue`, or a `Chart` trend — whose `MetricLayout` chooses
the stacked or inline form, and which draws no plate when unplated so a stack
of readings shares one container's surface); `metric::StatusPill`;
`record::FactList` (right-aligned key/value readouts where the value keeps its
room and the label truncates first); `record::Timeline` (a spine spanning only
first to last mark, shape-coded marks, a stamp column sized to the widest
stamp); `rail::ActionRail` (the vertical counterpart of `Toolbar`, composing
`Button`s so plate, role, disabled and denied rendering are not restated);
`collection::TableHeader` (sortable column titles sharing the row family's one
column-width model, reporting a sort the owner commits); and
`tabs::TabsOrientation` (a vertical orientation of the existing strip, so a
sidebar is not a second selection control).

**The three additions this plan needed — done.** Everything else the surface
composes from the above. Each is specified with its settle-point and damage
obligations in `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` (§11.35, §11.40, §11.12).

- **`chart::Chart` has an opposing series.** A read/write or receive/send rate
  is one reading with two directions, and drawing it as two stacked charts
  loses the comparison that matters. `with_opposing` takes a second series,
  plotted mirrored below a drawn axis and tinted by its own `SignalRole` — the
  *direction*, not the device, so a glance says which way the bytes went.
  One chart control and one plot path, not a second `DuplexChart` beside the
  first — the bounded `MAX_CHART_SAMPLES` window, the empty-series groove and
  the area treatment are reused whole. Adding a series *asserts the direction
  is measured*: a direction with no reading behind it is left off, so the
  chart stays a single-series trend over the whole box; an axis is drawn only
  where something is plotted, and a box too short for both halves degrades to
  the quiet plate rather than half a reading.
- **`metric::CompositionBar`** — named proportional parts of a measured whole,
  with a key naming each part and its amount. Answers *where did it go* for
  memory composition and for capacity by class. Shares that do not sum to the
  whole are a `CompositionError` at construction, not a silently short bar.
  The band is `composition_thickness` — several times a progress line's
  breadth — because a categorical run has to be identifiable against the key
  beneath it. Only its two *outer* ends are rounded: a part that meets another
  ends at a straight edge, since a rounded cap there lets the next part's
  colour through above and below the join, as deep as the band's radius.
  The parts separate by *hue* — a fixed rotation of the theme's own resource
  colours, led by the bar's own resource — because they are categories rather
  than degrees, and the joins are ruled so they stay countable on the
  monochrome-safe path. The part that is *not* in use is declared as the
  composition's `remainder`: the track's quiet neutral, last, still named in
  the key. It draws through the one measured-track geometry (`TrackBand`) in
  `controls::paint`, which `MetricTile`'s `Track` now shares. The key wraps
  rather than dropping a part, so `measured_height` takes the width it will be
  given.
- **`tabs::Tabs` (vertical) is a sidebar list.** The device rail is a sidebar,
  and a sidebar is not a second selection control. An entry's label leads with
  its live reading trailing on the same line, an optional bounded `Chart`
  trend draws beneath, and a quiet group heading may introduce the entry that
  *starts* a group — declared by that entry, so a heading can never point at
  one that is not there. Selection, focus and keyboard behaviour are reused
  whole. Entries **stack** at their own content height rather than sharing the
  column, which is what makes V1's discovered rail scroll rather than squeeze:
  `Tabs::measured_height` states the height the whole list wants. Because a
  vertical entry's rectangle depends on the theme's metrics, the hit test and
  every damage-reporting entry point take the scale and theme the strip was
  laid out with — the shape `ActionRail` already had; `Tabs::tab_area` is the
  forward mirror of `tab_at`, so a caller (or a pointer-driven test) aims at
  the rectangle `render` painted.

The measured-track geometry — groove, proportional tinted fill, pressure
outline — keeps its one definition in `controls::paint`, which `MetricTile`'s
`Track` instrument and `CompositionBar` both draw through; it is the only
reading-with-a-track in the design language.

Controls this surface deliberately does **not** add, because they are
composition rather than behaviour: the pressure banner (`Panel` +
`StatusPill` + `Button`), the per-core cell (an unplated `MetricTile` with a
`Chart` instrument and an outlined `StatusPill` badge, inside the cell's own
rim), the top-consumers row
(`TableRow` with a track cell), and the per-core grid itself, which is the
pane's layout and belongs to the pane.

## S8 — The interfaces the resource panes need — planned

Four queries, each modelled on an existing one so its gate and its shape are
not a new argument. Every one is paged by an `offset`/`limit` request, so a
fixed transport buffer never bounds how many devices a machine may have, and
every count, byte and duration is 64-bit.

**`VOLUME_IO_STATS` — ungated.** The storage analogue of `CPU_TIME_STATS`,
and ungated for the same reason: a machine-wide utilisation figure is one
every user may see, and it exposes strictly less than the already-ungated
`MOUNT_LIST`. Per volume, keyed by the same 16-byte `volume_id`:

- `read_bytes`, `write_bytes` — cumulative bytes transferred since attach.
- `read_ops`, `write_ops` — cumulative completed requests.
- `busy_ns` — cumulative time the device had at least one request in flight.
- `read_wait_ns`, `write_wait_ns` — cumulative time requests spent between
  issue and completion, summed per request.

Throughput, IOPS, utilisation and await are all two-sample deltas of these:
utilisation is `busy_ns` delta over the sample interval, await is `wait_ns`
delta over `ops` delta. Nothing is served pre-derived, so no consumer inherits
another's averaging window. A first sample yields no rate, exactly as the
per-task disk rate does.

**`VOLUME_IO_QUEUE` — `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`, audited.** The exact analogue of
`CPU_LOAD`, gated for the same reason: a queue depth is a driver and scheduler
internal, not the utilisation split every user may see. Per volume:

- `in_flight` — requests outstanding at the sample instant.
- `queue_depth_sum`, `queue_samples` — so a *mean* depth is a delta ratio
  rather than one instant's snapshot, which is what a reader actually wants.
- `budget_depth`, `budget_deadline_ns` — the `BlkDeviceClass` budget in force,
  so a depth is read against the ceiling that applies to that medium.

Q1 and Q2 are **landed**, over `IntrospectDomain::{VolumeIoStats, VolumeIoQueue}`
and one shared `VolumeIoRequest` all three per-volume reads page by. Their
counters are folded in the kernel `BlkClient` beside the health tallies
(`plans/FIX-IO.md` IO5) as `BlkIoCounters` / `BlkQueueCounters` — shared
`lib/abi` value types with a lock-free atomic mirror, so the fold and the
snapshot cannot diverge — and the mount registry walks the driver registry
**once** for all three lists, so they are keyed and ordered alike and a client
joins them by `volume_id`. The three counter populations differ on purpose:
`busy_ns` covers every attempt the device held (including one it never
answered, whose dead time utilisation must show), the `ops`/`wait_ns` pairs
cover the attempts it *answered* so await is a mean over requests that have a
latency, and the byte tallies count only what a completion moved.

**One deviation from `04-disk.png`: the queue-depth row reads a mean, not a
mean and a peak.** S8's field list is explicit and the board's own annotation
defers field choice to it. A monotonic high-water mark is also a poor reading
— after a day of uptime it pins at the ceiling and stays — and a windowed peak
is state no counter carries. The row reads `N.NN mean`.

**`GPU_DEVICE_STATS` — `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`. Landed.** Gated with
`HARDWARE_TREE`, whose device inventory it details, and audited with it. One
record per graphics device a display service drives, paged by a
`DeviceStatsRequest`:

- `busy_ns`, `idle_ns` — the same busy/idle vocabulary as the CPU, so
  utilisation derives the same way and no new averaging convention appears.
  Both are cumulative and partition the window since the device was first
  *driven* — opened inside the same bracket that measures `busy_ns`, so no
  request an unauthorised caller can send moves its epoch — and a reader takes
  a two-sample delta, so a first sample yields no share.
- `mem_resident_bytes`, `mem_total_bytes` — device memory, `0` total meaning
  the device has no memory of its own rather than none free.
- the device's `AccelCaps` (`max_layers`, `max_width_px`, `max_height_px`,
  `per_layer_opacity`), which existed in the display driver ABI with no query
  publishing it. Publishing it here is what lets the Graphics pane's
  compositing-path facts stop being unmeasured.
- the `DisplayMode` being scanned out, which fills the board's `Scan-out` row
  from the one component that knows it.

**The record is the display service's own `DisplayStats`, not a second
spelling of it** — the same shape `RAID_ARRAYS` serves the composer's own
`RaidArrayRecord` in. The producer is the process bound to `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`,
which is the only component that owns the device: it answers a new seatless
`QueryStats` operation gated on the *caller's* attested `CAP_SYSINFO_HW` (a
monitor holds no seat lease and never will, so a lease is the wrong question
about a device read), measures `busy_ns` by bracketing the driver's own
present call, and reads memory and capabilities from a `Display::device_report`
whose default is honest for a firmware framebuffer. It is a **pull**: nothing
is pushed per frame, so an unwatched device costs nothing.

**Deliberate deviation: no per-engine record.** The plan's field list said
"one per engine so a machine that reports engines separately is not flattened",
and no display driver in the tree reports engines at all — a framebuffer has
none, and the HVS is one fixed-function compositor. A per-engine record would
therefore be an interface with no producer, which the charter forbids adding
ahead of one. The device-level busy/idle is a real measurement with a live
producer; the Graphics pane's `Decode / encode engines` row states the
per-engine absence honestly instead. A device that genuinely reports its
engines separately brings the per-engine read with it.

**`ACCEL_DEVICE_STATS` — `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`.** The same shape for a
general-purpose accelerator: `busy_ns`/`idle_ns`, `mem_resident_bytes`/
`mem_total_bytes`, `in_flight`. One record per device, paged.

Each query enters `SYSINFO_QUERIES` with its `SysinfoQuerySpec`, and
`sysinfo-v1` is not frozen, so these are added in place with every consumer
updated in the same change. None of them adds a capability: the existing
`CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` and `CAP_SYSINFO_HW` already express exactly the two
boundaries involved, and a capability with no boundary of its own is not
added.

**The accelerator driver class is landed** (`drivers/accelerator/`, trait in
`lib/abi/src/driver/accelerator.rs`, `HwDeviceClass::Accelerator`), so a
hardware-tree node binds through the ordinary discovery-match path and never
by naming a part. What the class fixed, and what it deliberately left:

- **Two production classifiers, both with a live producer.** PCI base class
  `0x12` (`lib/pci`'s `describe_function`) and the three devicetree generic
  names for a device that computes rather than moves — `crypto`, `dsp`,
  `video-codec` (`kernel/arch/api`'s `fdtwalk`). Both previously reported such
  a device as `Other`, so nothing above discovery could tell an offload engine
  from an unmodelled one.
- **The class surface is two methods, not a general job ABI.**
  `device_report` (memory, the algorithms the device offers, the per-job
  ceiling) and `cipher`. A symmetric cipher is the only workload family a
  device in this tree offers; an operation for a family with no device and no
  consumer would be the interface-with-no-producer this plan already refused
  once. The occupancy a reader wants beside the report is the *hosting
  service's*, measured by bracketing the work call exactly as Q3's is — which
  is why `in_flight` is Q4's, not the driver's.
- **A session per job, because a retained key is a liability.**
  virtio-crypto binds key *and* direction into a device-side session; reusing
  one would mean holding the caller's key to compare the next job's against.
  Two extra control-queue round trips buys the guarantee that no key material
  outlives the call that supplied it.
- **A job above the published ceiling is refused, never split**, because
  splitting a chained-block job is the caller's initialisation-vector decision,
  not a silent driver transformation.
- **What V7 still brings.** A *virtio* accelerator's device type is visible
  only to a runtime slot probe, not to the device tree, so no
  `observe_virtio_mmio_accelerator_devices` and no driver-store bundle landed
  with D1: the rail is that probe's only consumer, and a probe emitting nodes
  nothing reads would be surface ahead of its consumer. The driver is proven
  end to end regardless — the QEMU vertical drives QEMU's own
  `virtio-crypto-device` through the signed `.rxe` load path and requires the
  NIST SP 800-38A F.2 AES-128-CBC known-answer cipher text byte for byte.

The pane still reports what discovery genuinely knows for an unbound node —
the node, its class, its match keys, and that no driver matched — which is a
real state, not an error and never a panic.

## S9 — Palette and pressure-kind additions — planned

`PressureKind` stops at Cpu, Memory, Disk, Network, Power, Thermal, so a
graphics or accelerator reading has no identity colour and its `Chart` cannot
be tinted. Two variants and two palette entries, in both built-in themes:

| Variant | Palette entry | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PressureKind::Gpu` | `gpu_pressure` | `#22b8a6` | `#0f8478` |
| `PressureKind::Accelerator` | `accelerator_pressure` | `#d94f8c` | `#a82f66` |

Teal sits clear of every existing hue. The accelerator magenta is 57° from the
memory violet and 28° from the recovery red — close to the latter in hue, but
`recovery` is only ever a fault signal and never tints a resource chart, so the
two cannot appear in the same role on one surface. Both are added with the
panes that use them, not ahead of them, and both are checked on the
heavier-contrast path and on paper-white.

## S10 — What this change deletes — planned

Superseded code is deleted, not renamed or left dead.

- `view/background.rs`, `view/pressure.rs`, `view/activities.rs` and their
  test modules — the sections go. `PressureClock` and the per-resource cause
  model move to the Resources banner; the group model moves to Tasks'
  grouping. The `Card`-based job list and the job action rail have no registry
  behind them and go entirely.
- `view/system.rs` and `view/system_data.rs` and their tests — replaced by
  `view/resources/`. The `PageLine` vocabulary (heading / fact / absence) and
  `SystemReport`'s `cores`, `memory` and `compositor` `Vec<SystemFact>` fields
  go with them: rendering a resource as key/value text is the defect this
  plan fixes. The reports that are genuinely fact lists — machine identity,
  seats, limits — survive as the `Machine` group's panes.
- `Section::{Jobs, Pressure, Activities, System}` and
  `CommandSection::{Jobs, Pressure, Activities, System}` — replaced by
  `Resources`. `map_section` and its exhaustive test table shrink with them.
  The wire discriminants are renumbered rather than left with holes:
  `sysinfo-v1` and the Switchboard IPC are unfrozen, and a reserved gap that
  nothing will ever fill is the compatibility debt the charter forbids.
- Any `TileInstrument`/`HeadlineTile` machinery that only served the old
  four-tile System header, once the pane heroes carry their own instruments.

**The shared reading vocabulary needs a surviving home before
`system_data.rs` goes.** `Reading`, `Unmeasured`, `absence_statement`,
`reading_text`, `selection_prompt` and the labelled-reading pair are read by
Recovery and Tasks as well, so they move to their own module first (a
volume's banded health is not among them: it is the shared
`tairix_abi::sysinfo::VolumeHealth` every surface reads); only the System-specific types (`SystemPage`, `SystemReport`,
`HeadlineTile`, `TileInstrument`, `PageLine`, `SystemAction`) are deleted.
`SystemFact` is renamed with the move — a type named after a deleted section
misleads every later reader.

`docs/src/desktop/switchboard.md` is rewritten in the same change: it
describes the section set, so it cannot survive the section set changing.

`view/tasks.rs`'s rustdoc references to `plans/switchboard1.png` (the column
order and the rail commands) re-point at
`plans/switchboard/01-tasks.png`, which is what now fixes those declarations.
The older `plans/switchboard[1-4].png` boards stay until then: they are still
the live reference those declarations cite, and are superseded only when the
code that cites them is rewritten.

## S11 — Consequences in other plans — planned

- **`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md`** — the tray capsule and the long-press route open
  a `CommandSection`, so both are re-pointed: a flagged icon still opens
  `Recovery`, and T13's system quick-actions menu opens `Resources` on the
  `Machine` group, whose action rail carries the session and power commands
  that menu offers. T10–T12's sampling, summary and lifecycle contract is
  unchanged. S2's "no permanent resource band above the sections" still holds
  and is still what T12's per-column-one-instrument rule depends on.
- **`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md`** — unaffected: it shares the controls,
  not the sections. The vertical `Tabs` extension (S7) is available to its
  pane list.
- **`plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md`** — Stage A's frame counters surface on the
  Graphics pane rather than a System page. The counters, their validation and
  the self-report suppression rule are unchanged.
- **`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`** — gains the three S7 controls in its
  control families, with the settle-point and damage obligations every
  interactive control carries.
- **`plans/FIX-IO.md`** — `VOLUME_IO_STATS`/`VOLUME_IO_QUEUE` read the
  per-device health and budget machinery that plan already defines; the
  counters are folded there, not invented here.

## S12 — Responsiveness obligations — done

The Switchboard is an interactive surface, so the desktop responsiveness rules
bind it directly, and a monitor is the easiest surface in the system to get
this wrong on.

- **Selecting a device performs no I/O.** The rail's selection changes which
  pane is drawn from state the sampler has already delivered. It issues no
  query, opens no store and waits on nothing; a pane with no sample yet reads
  unavailable rather than blocking for one.
- **The sampler is the worker.** It parks between cadence ticks and is woken
  by its timer, never spinning, and its results arrive as state the view
  adopts. A paint reads nothing.
- **A burst of input produces one paint.** Pointer motion over the rail, wheel
  deltas over a pane and resize samples all arrive faster than the screen can
  show them: the loop drains, then paints once.
- **A repaint is scoped to what changed.** A fresh sample damages the
  instruments whose readings moved and the rows whose cells moved — not the
  whole client. Re-deriving the pane because *a* sample landed is the defect,
  and it is worst exactly where the machine is slowest and the rail longest.
  - **`SectionView::adopt` is a damage-reporting entry point.** It carries the
    layout inputs `on_pointer`/`on_key` already carry, as one `Sweep` (the
    frame the round holds, or none, plus the sink) shared with the focus marks
    — so the section on show reports against the frame it will next be drawn
    in and the two that are not on show report nothing, which is unrepresentable
    rather than merely avoided. Each concrete `adopt` compares what it derived
    against what it held: `tasks` in `arrange`, which is also the one place a
    sort re-derives the table, so a sort reports the rows it moved and not
    only the heading the reader touched;
    `recovery` from the slots `resettle_cards` already found changed; and
    `resources` from a `Rebuilt` record naming its rail, its command column and
    the pane items that moved.
  - **`Panel::refresh`'s `repaint_whole()` is replaced**, and `Panel`'s
    `Presented` record — a deep compare *and* deep clone of the whole
    composition on every `flush`, purely to decide whether a present would draw
    anything — is **deleted**, along with `RenderInputs` and
    `invalidate_presented`: with damage authoritative an empty region is that
    answer for free, and every geometry/theme/scale change already reaches the
    panel as a window event answered with `repaint_whole`.
  - **A selection is a round that reports, not a control that was pressed.**
    A rail entry names the pane beside it and a fault card names the detail
    beside it, so every route to a selection — the press, the cursor the
    keyboard moves onto it, and the Enter that commits it — reports the pane or
    detail, the commands describing it, and the marks the strip or cards moved.
    `SectionView::set_content_focus` therefore carries the `Sweep` its
    `set_row_action` sibling always did, since in two of the three sections the
    cursor *is* the selection. Recovery's `rebuild_selection` takes the
    selection it re-derives *from*: its detail pane and impact column have no
    retained control to compare, so only a moved selection can tell them they
    owe a repaint, and reporting them unconditionally would repaint both every
    second for no change. The scrollbar is the round's where the selection left
    the section holding a different number of items — the routed controls know
    nothing about a bar that is not theirs, and the next paint re-ranges it
    inside the rectangle the round named.
  - **The risk this moves, and what holds it.** An unreported change now leaves
    a stale pixel rather than over-covering, so the burden is on every
    section's `adopt` and on every round that selects. The proof is
    `unreported_change`, already the crate's soundness helper: over all three
    sections, a refresh's reported region must contain every pixel a whole
    re-render moved, and so must a selection round's. Beside it, a refresh
    reports less than the client, and an unmoved reading reports nothing. The
    proof is also what catches a control drawing *outside* the region that owns
    it, since no report scoped to that region can ever cover it.
  - **Measured.** Tasks 916 µs → 185 µs per refresh-and-repaint, Resources
    569 → 32, Recovery 448 → 31, and the presented rectangle 442×144 rather
    than 760×560 — which is what the session's serve thread decodes.
    `lib/controls`' shared `paint::withheld` gate is what makes a scoped render
    actually cheap: before it, three fifths of a whole render survived any clip.
  - **A scroll reports its list and its bar**, never the section: the pinned
    headings, the banner, the commands and the footer do not move — the
    commands' rail only on the turn that lights or puts out its Edge Wake. A
    rail scroll reports the rail's column alone.
  - **A keyboard focus move reports the marks it moved.** A focus ring or a
    Focus Field written through a control's plain setter reports nothing
    itself, so whoever writes it reports where the control shows
    (`Sweep::restyled`) — the rows, the fault cards, the commands, the footer
    controls, the relief and the scrollbar's own ring. The proof is a keyboard
    walk over every section held to `unreported_change`, beside the pointer
    walk.
- **A task's menu performs no I/O on the loop.** It is built from the model in
  hand and sent as one `OpenMenu`; its answer arrives as an ordinary window
  event, so nothing waits on the desktop for it.
- **The frame report never measures this window.** The suppression rule in S4
  is a responsiveness obligation as much as an honesty one: without it the
  Graphics pane re-excites its own repaint forever.

## S13 — Open: what the storyboards still show that the surface does not

Recorded so the remaining gap between `plans/switchboard/*.png` and the
running surface is a list rather than a rediscovery. None of these is a
correctness defect; each is a place the boards say something the composition
does not yet say.

- **A per-core cell stacks its readings over its own trace.** The boards put
  the core's name and badge on a top line, the trace under them, and the busy
  share beside the clock on *one* line beneath — the cell's whole point being
  the shape *and* the figures. The tile's `Stacked` layout instead puts
  label / value / detail on three lines and the flow overlays the trace across
  the middle of them, so the busy share is drawn over its own trace. Fixing it
  means the cell laying its three bands out itself and asking the tile for
  each, rather than one tile spanning the cell with a chart on top.
- **The class badge is about twice the height the boards draw it.** It takes
  `StatusPill::measured_height` — a body line plus the control padding above
  and below — where the boards draw a small rounded square barely taller than
  its letter. A badge-sized pill is a control-family question (the health
  pills read the same metric), not a switchboard one.
- **A gated command's rim is drawn at full strength.** The label, the leading
  mark and the rim all take the warning amber, which is the boards' colour and
  the shared `Emphasis::Outlined` weight every outlined control in the family
  uses; `02-cpu.png` draws its rim at about a fifth of that intensity
  (`#362e15`). Dimming it is a change to *every* outlined control's rim, so it
  belongs with the emphasis recipe rather than here.
- **The pressure banner has a warm horizontal wash** — sampled `#20150a` at
  its leading edge fading to `#161a1c` at its trailing one. It draws no
  background at all. Nearly free now that the chart's ramp exists: it is the
  same `Surface::wash_region` ramp a title bar's hue already uses.
- **The band's shed route is built but never drawn.** The narrow-window
  `ComboBox` (`09-theme-and-shed.png`'s "▼ CPU") is constructed on every
  sample and neither rendered nor hit-tested.
- **The boards draw Tasks chrome the section no longer has.** The four census
  pills, the `All / Mine / System / Faults` strip, the `Search tasks` field,
  the `ACTIONS` rail and the footer on `01-tasks.png` are retired; the rows
  take their room, and a task's commands are its row's menu.
- **The boards draw a storage entry's figure as how full it is.** It reads the
  device's busy share instead (S4).
- **The boards draw one hue for both halves of a duplex trace.** Storage and
  network traces separate their directions instead — reads green against
  writes red, receive blue against send violet — so a read-heavy and a
  write-heavy device do not look alike.
- **Not yet audited against the boards at all:** the task row's leading
  pressure gutter, the faulted-task Signal Bead, and the composition-bar
  legend.
- **Still divergent, deliberately:** the processor block states one `Model` row
  joined with `·` where the boards give the performance and efficiency parts a
  row each and add a `Scheduler policy` row. No reading behind it is wrong — it
  is a layout the boards spell differently.
- **Every process is pictured, not just the ones the desktop launched.** A
  session-attested bundle is the better identity where it exists, and every
  other process resolves its icon from its **name** — which the kernel attests
  from the store path it loaded and which no process can set for itself —
  through the fixed store order (`IconRequest::program`, `plans/ICONS.md`). The
  service store is on that list: most of what a quiet machine runs is services,
  and leaving it off left the busiest rows on the surface wearing the one
  generic mark. The asking session's own two stores are on it too, searched
  **last** — so a user's own command app draws its own icon, while every
  read-only system store is tried first and none of theirs can be shadowed.
  Only that session's home is searched: enumerating `/Users` would let one
  account choose the picture another account's task wears.
- **The Recovery fault column carries no `FAULTS` heading**, where the boards
  do. The card list's geometry is the shared `ListInfo::cards` scroll range, so
  a heading means insetting that range rather than drawing above it, and the
  column is the one place a heading would have to come from the section instead
  of from a group of entries.

## S14 — The machine report

The System Monitor screensaver (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md` DS23) draws the
machine from this service's readings. The session holds no sysinfo authority
and no process but the session draws over the lock, so this service publishes
data and the session draws it.

- **One frame, one projection.** `MachineReport`
  (`lib/abi/src/switchboard_ipc/machine.rs`, magic `SWM1`) shares
  `SWITCHBOARD_ENDPOINT` with the tray summary. Its magic sets it apart and it
  decodes fail-closed through one fixed-width layout. An absent reading is a
  cleared presence bit over zero bytes, and every accepted frame re-encodes
  byte-identically. `machine_report` (`src/machine.rs`) projects one sample
  through the very readings the Resources section draws:
  - processors, with every core and the load;
  - committed memory, its band and the class composition;
  - the task census, with recovery counted by the Recovery section's own
    classifier, and the busiest by processor time;
  - the storage devices, least healthy first;
  - the interfaces other than loopback, at byte rates.

  A name is cut to its wire bound with the shared ellipsis, never refused.
- **A lease, not a subscription.** `WatchMachine { watch }` turns the reports
  on and off. The session sends it only to the instance it has attested, and
  re-offers a refused watch on that instance's next publish. Reports go out
  only on a sample's own cycle, plus once straight away when a watch begins,
  so watching adds no wake-up.
- **A lost stop heals itself.** The session answers a report it has no board
  for with `BrokenPipe`, which ends the watch. Any other refusal ends it too,
  stated on `stderr`, while `WouldBlock` leaves it running. Whatever happens
  to the reports, the tray summary goes on.
