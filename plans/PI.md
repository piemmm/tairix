# PI.md — Booting TAIRiX on a real Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711, aarch64)

This is the staged build plan for taking the `kernel/arch/aarch64` port
from "boots on the QEMU `virt` board" to "boots a real Raspberry Pi 4
(BCM2711) into user mode and, ultimately, the desktop / window manager".

`AGENTS.md` is binding — read it, `PLAN.md`, and `plans/WIRING.md` first.
Every rule in this file is binding too. The continuation prompt for fresh
contexts is this plan.

**Note:** `abi-v1` is *not* frozen, despite what `AGENTS.md` / `PLAN.md`
say — the standing task direction supersedes that language. Changing a
`lib/abi` type today is allowed; it requires regenerating the C header
(`cargo xtask c-header --write`), which the drift guard enforces.

## 0. Scope and binding decisions

1. **One board, the Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711).** This plan targets the
   Pi 4 / Pi 400 (BCM2711, Cortex-A72, GIC-400) specifically. The Pi 3
   (BCM2837, no GIC) and Pi 5 (BCM2712, RP1 southbridge) are explicitly
   out of scope here; they reuse this work as a later board port. Each
   board difference that surfaces is recorded, never silently assumed.

2. **HAL-first, never `virt`-vs-Pi `cfg` switches (§17.2 / §2.2).** The
   QEMU `virt` board and the Pi 4 are two *boards* of the **same**
   `aarch64` architecture. Their differences — UART model and base, the
   interrupt-controller base, the RAM/MMIO map, the boot protocol, the
   mailbox/framebuffer — are **runtime board data discovered from the
   device tree**, never `cfg(board = …)` forks of the port (that would be
   the §2.2 duplication / §2.3 bloat this charter forbids, and the
   §17.2 burn-down already moved discovery behind `PlatformDiscovery`).
   The single legitimate per-board artefact is the **boot stub + linker
   script + load address** (the `AGENTS.md` §1 "boot stubs" carve-out for
   architecture-required assembly), because that is fixed before any tree
   is parsed.

3. **Discovery is the contract.** Everything the kernel needs to talk to
   Pi 4 hardware — the `/memory` map, the UART (`compatible`,
   `reg`), the GIC-400 (`reg` for GICD/GICC), the timer PPIs, the mailbox,
   the SD host, the USB host — is read from the Pi 4 device tree through
   the shared `lib/fdt` reader and normalised into `tairix_abi::hwtree`
   by `kernel/arch/aarch64::platform::FdtDiscovery` (§18.2). The MMIO
   bases currently hard-coded as `virt` constants
   (`serial::PL011_BASE`, `gic::{GICD_BASE,GICC_BASE}`) must become
   discovered values threaded from the tree, not compile-time constants.

4. **No hard-coded device list standing in for detection (§18.5).** The
   Pi 4 peripherals autoload through the §18.3 `devmgr` match path against
   driver bind tables, exactly as on `virt`. "It's a Pi, just poke the
   known addresses" is forbidden.

5. **Fail closed, no hacks (§2.1 / §2.9 / §5.4).** No
   `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths, no `unsafe` without a
   `// SAFETY:` block plus a test, no retry-until-it-works bring-up, no
   "boots if you squint" milestones. A primitive the Pi genuinely lacks
   (or that is deferred) is declared honestly, mirroring §0.4 of
   `plans/WIRING.md`.

6. **Two proving grounds, both required.** Every stage that *can* be
   proven in emulation lands a `qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi4b` (or
   `raspi3b` where the Pi-4 model is unavailable) vertical **in addition
   to** the existing `-M virt` verticals — so the board-discovery path is
   exercised in CI without hardware. Stages that can only be proven on
   metal (real mailbox/HDMI, real SD/USB timing) land a documented
   **hardware bring-up checklist** and a UART-log capture as the
   acceptance artefact, since CI has no Pi attached.

7. **Docs + tests are part of every stage (§7 / §13).** Each stage
   updates `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` (and adds
   `docs/src/install/raspberry_pi.md` when Stage 8 image work lands),
   plus `PLAN.md` and this file, in the same change. Tests are never
   deferred.

8. **One increment per landing.** Land one complete, fully-gated stage,
   update `PLAN.md` + this file, refresh this plan, then
   start the next.

9. **Metal re-verification is guaranteed, not speculative (operator
   commitment, binding).** The operator re-verifies every applicable
   stage on a real Raspberry Pi 4B as the work proceeds and supplies the
   UART/debug-log (or photo) acceptance artefact between chunks. The
   metal-acceptance step *will* be checked every time it applies — it is
   never assumed, skipped, or treated as optional. Therefore design
   decisions are made for the **most correct, properly-designed,
   senior-review-clean** outcome (`AGENTS.md` §2.6 / §23): security and
   correctness are the floor (§2.1 / §5.4 / §23.1), performance is
   first-class (§2.16), and drivers are generic, modular hardware
   interfaces — from PCI/PCIe bridges down to the individual USB-HID
   interface (keyboard, mouse, storage, scanner, printer, …) and other
   PCI devices (storage, serial, parallel/printer ports, …) — never a
   Pi-4-only special case (the work must equally serve `x86_64`,
   `riscv64`, and other boards: §0.2 / §17.2 / §18). Do **not** trade
   design quality for a smaller blast radius on the assumption metal
   verification is optional: it is not. A chunk touching a live,
   metal-confirmed path lands host-tested **plus** a metal checklist —
   never a hack to dodge a check (§2.1).

## 1. Baseline — where the aarch64 port stands today

`kernel/arch/aarch64` is at QEMU-`virt` parity with x86_64 (`plans/WIRING.md`
W6/W7/W17): EL1 boot trampoline with an EL2→EL1 drop (`boot.s`), PL011
console (`serial`), GICv2 (`gic`), generic-timer preemption (`preempt`),
stage-1 MMU (`paging`), `svc` syscall entry, `eret` user entry
(`userentry`), context switch, PSCI `CPU_ON` SMP bring-up (`psci` + `smp`),
per-CPU storage (`percpu_hal`), side-channel + memory-tagging profiles,
and FDT → `hwtree` discovery (`platform` + `fdt`). All of it is proven
under `qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt`.

**What is `virt`-specific (the Pi-4 gap):**

| Concern | Today (`virt`) | Pi 4 (BCM2711) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production kernel binary | none — aarch64 boots only via per-test bins; `tairix-kernel/build.rs` wires **only** `x86_64` | a real `aarch64-unknown-none` `tairix-kernel` image is required |
| Boot protocol | QEMU `-kernel <elf>`, aarch64 hand-off `x0 = DTB` at EL2/EL1 | Pi firmware (`start4.elf`) loads `kernel8.img` at `0x80000`, enters EL2, `x0 = DTB` (Pi firmware-supplied) |
| Load address / linker | `0x4020_0000` (`aarch64-virt.ld`) | `0x8_0000` (needs an `aarch64-rpi4.ld`) |
| Console UART | PL011 @ `0x0900_0000` (fixed const) | PL011 @ `0xFE20_1000` *or* mini-UART (AUX) @ `0xFE21_5040`, base discovered |
| Interrupt controller | GICv2 @ GICD `0x0800_0000` / GICC `0x0801_0000` (fixed const) | GIC-400 @ GICD `0xFF84_1000` / GICC `0xFF84_2000`, base discovered |
| RAM base | `0x4000_0000` | `0x0` (low 1 GiB; up to 8 GiB with the `>3GiB` window) |
| Display | virtio-gpu / ramfb | VideoCore mailbox framebuffer → `drivers/display/rpi_hvs` (HVS) |
| Storage | virtio-blk-mmio | EMMC2 SD host controller (`drivers/storage`) |
| Input | virtio-keyboard-mmio | USB HID via the VL805/DWC2 USB host (`drivers/bus/usb`) |
| Image builder | `tools/mkimage` emits `images/tairix-aarch64-rpi.img` (P9) | flash + boot the emitted image on metal |

`drivers/display/rpi_hvs` already exists (HVS layer compositor, mock-host
tested) and consumes an `HvsConfig` the boot capability provides; it has
no hardware vertical yet.

---

## 2. Strategy

The work splits into three arcs:

- **Arc A — Boot to a UART prompt on the `raspi4b` model (P1–P3).**
  Pure-software, fully CI-provable under `qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi4b`.
  This de-risks the boot protocol, the linker/load address, the console,
  and board discovery without any hardware.
- **Arc B — Reach user mode on the Pi (P4–P6).** Interrupt controller,
  timer, MMU, and the live scheduler over discovered Pi bases; spawn an
  init process. Still mostly `raspi4b`-provable, with a metal checklist.
- **Arc C — Real peripherals + bootable image + desktop (P7–P10).**
  Mailbox/framebuffer, SD, USB-HID, the SD-card image, and finally the
  WM/taskbar on the HVS path. These need real hardware to *fully* prove.
- **Arc D — Multi-user login (P11).** Every installed text console sits
  at a `login:` prompt backed by the `/System/Security/Users` database.
  With a display active the video console is the only console — the UART
  then carries the debug log alone, with no session; on a serial-only
  boot the UART is the console.

Land them in order; each stage's "Done when" gate is binding.

## 3. Stages

> Status is the ledger's, above. Keep it and the PLAN.md Stage-3b/Stage-8
> entries in sync.

### P0 — Pi-4 facts of record (no code)

Pin down the BCM2711 numbers this plan depends on, in
`docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` under a new "Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711)"
section, so later stages cite one authoritative source (§13, no guessing
per §15.7):

- Low-peripheral MMIO base `0xFE00_0000` (the `0x7E00_0000` VC bus alias
  mapped to ARM physical `0xFE00_0000`); PL011 `+0x20_1000`, AUX mini-UART
  `+0x21_5000`, mailbox `+0x00_B880`, EMMC2 `+0x34_0000`.
- GIC-400: GICD `0xFF84_1000`, GICC `0xFF84_2000`.
- Boot: firmware loads `kernel8.img` at `0x8_0000`, AArch64, enters at
  EL2, `x0` = DTB pointer; `config.txt` knobs (`arm_64bit=1`,
  `kernel=kernel8.img`, `enable_uart=1`, `armstub`).
- RAM layout for the 1/2/4/8 GiB SKUs and the `>3GiB` aliasing window.

**Done when:** the section exists, links cleanly (`cargo xtask
docs-check`), and is referenced by P1+. No source code changes.

### P1 — Pi-4 boot stub + linker script + production aarch64 kernel binary

- Add `kernel/arch/aarch64/link/aarch64-rpi4.ld` (load `0x8_0000`),
  alongside the existing `aarch64-virt.ld`. Two linker scripts is the
  §0.2 boot carve-out, not duplication — they differ only in the origin
  address and a comment.
- Generalise `boot.s` so the EL2→EL1 drop + `.bss` clear + stack setup is
  board-independent (it already is, bar the comment); confirm it works
  from EL2 with the Pi register hand-off. If the Pi enters all 4 cores at
  `_start` (firmware default, no `armstub` spin-table), the stub must park
  secondaries (`MPIDR_EL1` affinity ≠ 0 → `wfe` loop) until PSCI/SMP
  bring-up wants them — fail closed, never race (§2.1).
- Teach `kernel/tairix-kernel/build.rs` + source to build as the
  freestanding **aarch64** production kernel (today `is_freestanding()`
  is hard-coded to `x86_64`). The `freestanding` cfg and the
  boot/panic/serial-sink modules must select the aarch64 boot path and
  linker script by `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH` — this is build glue, the §17.2
  allow-listed place for target conditionals.
- The binary's `kernel_main(dtb)` wires `Aarch64Arch` into `kernel/core`
  (the single §17.1/§17.2 selection point), mirroring the x86_64 `boot`
  module.

**Done when:** `cargo build -p tairix-kernel --target aarch64-unknown-none`
produces a freestanding ELF that links against `aarch64-rpi4.ld`; a host
unit test covers the new `build.rs` arch/linker selection; no `cfg-check`
/ `deps-check` regressions.

**Landed.** `kernel/arch/aarch64/link/aarch64-rpi4.ld` (origin `0x8_0000`)
sits beside `aarch64-virt.ld`; `boot.s` now parks non-boot CPUs
(`MPIDR_EL1` affinity ≠ 0 → `wfe`) before touching the boot stack, so it
serves both `virt` (PSCI-held secondaries) and the Pi (all-core release).
Both EL1 entry trampolines (`boot.s` `.Lin_el1`, `smp.s`) write the known
MMU-off `SCTLR_EL1` (`paging::SCTLR_MMU_OFF`, ARMv8.0 RES1 bits only,
unit-test-pinned) before the first EL1 data access, and
`AddressSpace::switch` installs the whole known `paging::SCTLR_MMU_ON`
(RES1 + M + C + I, after `ic iallu`) rather than OR-ing `M` into the
live register: `SCTLR_EL1` is architecturally UNKNOWN at first EL1 entry
on real silicon (EL2 hand-off and PSCI `CPU_ON` alike), and a carried
UNKNOWN `WXN`/`EE` bit hung the metal Pi 4 at the MMU switch while QEMU
(benign reset values) stayed green.
The same UNKNOWN-reset-state rule holds one level up: the Pi firmware
stub sets only `SCTLR_EL2` and `CPUECTLR_EL1.SMPEN`, so `boot.s`'s EL2
path writes every EL2 control register **whole** with the
unit-test-pinned hand-off values in `tairix_arch_aarch64::el2`
(`HCR_EL2 = RW`, `CNTHCTL_EL2 = EL1PCTEN|EL1PCEN`, `CPTR_EL2 =` RES1,
`MDCR_EL2 = 0`, `VPIDR/VMPIDR` mirrored) — an UNKNOWN `HCR_EL2.TVM`
traps EL1's first `MAIR/TCR/TTBR/SCTLR` write into vector-less EL2,
hanging the metal Pi 4B silently at the MMU switch while QEMU stayed
green.
The boot identity window is bounded to backed memory: gigapages are mapped
only when named by the configured Device mask or the configured
kernel-extent mask (`paging::configure_kernel_gigapages` /
`gigapage_mask_from_extents`, default all — for host tests and the QEMU
integration kernels), and
every other L1 slot is left *invalid* so speculation cannot reach
unbacked bus windows (the metal Pi 4B wedged at the MMU switch exactly
there while QEMU stayed green). The boot path derives the kernel-extent
mask once, pre-MMU, from the kernel image extent, the firmware DTB blob,
and the scan-out surface — the things the kernel addresses *physically*.
It is not widened over discovered RAM: an allocator frame is reached
through the direct physical map in the `TTBR1_EL1` regime
(`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D56), so a process root carries no mapping of RAM
in the half user code addresses and the window does not grow with the
machine. The switch itself is
real-silicon-honest: the just-written tables are swept to PoC
(`PageTablePool::clean_invalidate_to_poc`, `dc civac` per
`CTR_EL0`-decoded line — MMU-off stores bypass the cache but the walker
reads back cacheable, so firmware cache residue would shadow the
descriptors) and `switch` orders those Device-nGnRnE stores with a
full-system `dsb sy` before enabling translation. The pool's allocation
counter is translation-aware: MMU-off it advances by plain load + store
(LDXR/STXR exclusives never succeed on the BCM2711's MMU-off
Device-nGnRnE accesses, so a `fetch_add` spins forever on metal while
QEMU stays green; MMU-off allocation is pre-SMP boot-CPU-only by
construction) and reverts to `fetch_add` once translation is live. The
permanent park root follows the same boundary: `program_stage1_translation`
returns a private live-translation witness after `SCTLR_EL1` + `isb`, and
only that witness performs the set-once atomic publication, so the MMU-off
activation prefix contains no exclusive retry loop.
With those fixes the metal Pi 4B (8 GB) boots the production pipeline
end to end **through user space**: the
stage-p1 boot line, the kernel-core phase log, PID 1 `init`'s EL0 entry
and banner, and the spawn/wait/exit supervision cycle all render on
both UART0 and the HDMI console (every spawned space's identity window
is derived from the configured Device/kernel-extent gigapage masks,
`paging::configured_identity_gigapages` — P6c-3/P6d — since the former
hard-coded 2 GiB `virt` window dropped the Pi's gigapage-3 UART/GIC
from PID 1's root). The session formerly read end-of-input at its first
prompt (the metal had nothing queued in the PL011 RX FIFO) and exited,
exhausting `init`'s crash-loop budget; the kernel-core
`BlockingConsoleRead` backing (P6e-2) now parks the reader until UART
RX delivers bytes, so the metal session waits at `tairix$ ` for the
user to type.
`kernel/tairix-kernel/build.rs` factors its pure selection logic into
`src/build_support.rs` (host-unit-tested) and emits a build-glue
`kernel_isa` cfg + the per-board linker script — no `cfg(target_arch)` in
the crate body (cfg-check clean). The crate's x86_64 boot pipeline is
gated `kernel_isa="x86_64"`; the new freestanding `boot_aarch64` module +
the aarch64 `kernel_main(dtb)` in `main.rs` construct `Aarch64Arch` (the
§17 selection point), bring up the console, log a boot line, and park
fail-closed. `cargo build -p tairix-kernel --target aarch64-unknown-none`
links a freestanding ELF entered at `0x8_0000`. The discovery-fed
`kernel_core::kernel_main` hand-off (a real memory map / IRQ routing) is
deliberately staged to P2/P3 — fabricating a hardware map would violate
§18.5, and the `-M raspi4b` runtime vertical that proves it cannot pass
until P2's console discovery lands. The `CPACR_EL1.FPEN` enable is now a
single `tairix_arch_aarch64::enable_fp_el1()` helper (§2.2), adopted by
the production binary and the existing aarch64 verticals.

### P2 — Board-discovered UART console (PL011 + mini-UART)

- The fixed `serial::PL011_BASE` constant is gone: the console MMIO base +
  register model now live in a new host-testable
  `tairix_arch_aarch64::console` module (an atomic `(base, model)` pair,
  default = the `virt` PL011 base) that the freestanding `serial` sink
  transmits through on every byte. `console::configure_from_fdt` reads the
  base + model from the device tree, decoding the node's `reg` with its
  parent bus's cell counts and translating it through the ancestor
  buses' `ranges` (the shared `fdt::scan_translated` /
  `fdt::translated_reg` machinery, §2.2) — the real Pi tree's UARTs sit
  under `/soc` with one-cell *bus* `reg` values (`0x7E20_1000`) remapped
  to CPU-physical space (`0xFE20_1000`); an untranslatable node is
  skipped, never poked at its raw bus address (§2.9). The
  `raspi_like_arm` fixture mirrors that real shape (root 2+1 cells,
  `/soc` simple-bus with 1+1 cells and the three BCM2711 `ranges`,
  bus-address parameters). The BCM2835 **AUX mini-UART** is a
  second `ConsoleModel` behind the same `tairix_log::Sink` seam (its own
  `AUX_MU_IO`/`AUX_MU_LSR` register offsets + opposite-sense TX-ready bit),
  selected by the `compatible` string — `brcm,bcm2835-aux-uart` vs
  `arm,pl011`. One console abstraction, two register backends (§2.2).
- `platform::FdtDiscovery` emits a `serial`-class `HwNode` carrying the
  discovered UART `compatible` bind key + its `reg` as a capability-gated
  MMIO resource, so the console base is discovered, not assumed.
- `boot_aarch64::boot` calls `console::configure_from_fdt` from the `x0`
  DTB before its first log line (MMU-off-safe: the `lib/fdt` reader is
  byte-wise, no multi-byte Device-memory load — W17).
- Discovery alone leaves real silicon silent: `uart_init::init_from_fdt`
  runs right after it, muxing GPIO 14/15 to the PL011 (`GPFSEL1` ALT0 +
  pull-none, gated on a discovered `brcm,bcm2711-gpio` node) and
  programming the PL011 line (TRM order, 115200 8N1 + FIFOs from the
  `config.txt`-pinned 48 MHz `init_uart_clock`) — QEMU's powered-up
  PL011 masked the omission; the metal Pi 4B booted with a permanently
  silent UART0 without it. Pure, host-tested register arithmetic; the
  freestanding layer is volatile MMIO only (§2.2).
- The real firmware tree is a regression input: the
  `real_dtb_probe` integration test runs the production discovery walks
  (console, GPIO, mailbox, memory) over the pinned
  `bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb` when the firmware cache is present (skips
  honestly when not fetched).

**Done when:** host unit tests cover the mini-UART/PL011 register
encoders and the `compatible`-string console selection + the discovered
`serial` `HwNode` (against the new `tairix_fdt` `raspi_like_arm` fixture);
and the new `tests/integration/uart_console_qemu_aarch64` vertical boots
the `virt` board, **poisons** the console base, then proves
`configure_from_fdt` overwrites it with the base read from the firmware
device tree and that writes reach that base (it prints two lines over the
*discovered* console before the semihosting PASS finisher). All existing
`virt` aarch64 verticals stay green.

**Emulation gap (honest, not faked — §2.1):** the vertical runs on `-M
virt`, **not** a Pi board, because QEMU's `raspi*` models do not model the
Raspberry Pi GPU-firmware DTB hand-off — they enter an ELF `-kernel` with
`x0 = 0` (verified by GDB on `raspi3b`), and QEMU 8.2.2 has no `raspi4b`
at all. The `virt` board *does* pass its generated tree (which carries a
real `arm,pl011` node), so the runtime discover→configure→print path is
CI-proven there against a genuine firmware tree (the canonical `virt` DTB,
dumped + embedded at build time since `-kernel <ELF>` passes no pointer).
The Pi's *specific* console base + the mini-UART register layout are
covered by the host unit tests against the `raspi_like_arm` fixture, and
printing on real Pi PL011 silicon is an on-metal acceptance item for the
Arc C peripheral stages (where the real firmware populates `x0`).

### P3 — GIC-400 from the tree + Pi RAM map

- The GICv2 driver register layout already matches GIC-400; thread the
  GICD/GICC bases from `FdtDiscovery` instead of the `virt` constants
  `gic::{GICD_BASE,GICC_BASE}`. Emit a GIC `HwNode` from discovery.
- Generalise the early memory map: `FdtDiscovery::first_memory_region`
  already reads `/memory`; confirm it yields the Pi's `0x0`-based RAM and
  feed it to `kernel/mem` so the allocator/page tables cover real Pi RAM,
  not the `virt` `0x4000_0000` assumption.

**Done when:** the existing `ipi_smp` / `sched_drive` aarch64 verticals
(or a new `-M raspi4b` analogue) run over **discovered** GIC bases and
Pi RAM, GICv2 IRQs + SGIs deliver, and `cargo xtask cfg-check` confirms no
board constants leaked outside the arch crate.

**Landed.** The fixed `gic::{GICD_BASE,GICC_BASE}` constants are gone:
`gic` now holds the active `(gicd, gicc)` pair as an atomic (default = the
`virt` GICv2 `0x0800_0000`/`0x0801_0000`) that the freestanding
`VolatileGicMmio` reads on every access, with `gic::find_gic` /
`configure_from_fdt` over `lib/fdt` selecting the first GICv2-class
controller (`arm,gic-400`, `arm,cortex-a15-gic`, …) and reading its
first two `reg` regions (GICD, GICC), each decoded with the parent
bus's cell counts and translated through the ancestor buses' `ranges`
(`fdt::translated_reg`) — the real Pi tree's GIC-400 sits under `/soc`
with one-cell bus `reg` values (`0x4004_1000` → `0xFF84_1000`).
`platform::FdtDiscovery` emits an `InterruptController` `HwNode`
carrying the discovered `compatible` bind key + every register window
(`HwDeviceClass::InterruptController` already existed — no ABI change).
The `lib/fdt` `virt_like_arm` / `raspi_like_arm` fixtures carry a GIC
node (virt `arm,cortex-a15-gic` at the root; Pi `arm,gic-400` under
`/soc` with the real four bus-address regions); host tests cover the
GIC discovery, the `HwNode`, and the fail-closed no-GIC path.
`boot_aarch64` parses the `x0` DTB and points the console **and** the
GIC driver at their discovered bases MMU-off, then reads the `/memory`
window once the MMU is on, logging `gic_discovered` / `ram_discovered`
(the live allocator + `kernel_core::kernel_main` hand-off over that map is
deliberately staged to P4/P6 — a hard-coded map would violate §18.5).
**Runtime proof on `-M virt`:** the `ipi_smp_qemu_aarch64` vertical now
**poisons** the GIC base, rediscovers it from the embedded `virt` DTB
before `gic::init`, and asserts it moved to the `virt` GICv2 base, so the
delivered IPI exercises the *discovered* base (`irq_qemu_aarch64` likewise
reads `gic::current()`); both PASS. `cargo xtask cfg-check` stays clean
(no board constant leaked outside the arch crate). The Pi's specific
GIC-400 bases are host-unit-tested + an on-metal item (no `raspi4b` in
QEMU — the same gap as P2).

### P4 — Generic timer + live scheduler on the Pi

- Reuse the W7 live-scheduler wiring (`preempt` + `context` + `mlfq`) over
  the discovered GIC-400 + Pi generic-timer PPI. The Pi's `CNTFRQ_EL0` and
  timer PPIs come from the tree (`timer_ppi` already reads them); confirm
  the Pi's 54 MHz crystal / `CNTFRQ` is honoured rather than the `virt`
  value.

**Done when:** a `-M raspi4b` `sched_drive` vertical drives the live
`Scheduler` ≥ 20 timer ticks + ≥ 1 IPI tick, exactly as the `virt` one
does (`plans/WIRING.md` W7).

**Landed.** The generic-timer counter rate is now a *discovered* board
fact rather than the raw register: `fdt::timer_clock_frequency` reads the
`/timer` node's optional `clock-frequency` override (the standard
`arm,armv?-timer` binding the firmware carries when `CNTFRQ_EL0` is
mis-programmed) and the pure, host-tested `fdt::effective_timer_hz`
selects it over `CNTFRQ_EL0` when present and non-zero, else falls back to
the register (a zero override is treated as absent — never a 0 Hz timer,
§2.9). The freestanding `kernel_arch::timer_frequency_hz(&fdt)` composes
the two; `boot_aarch64` seeds the `Aarch64Arch` clock/preempt interval
from it and logs `timer_hz_from_tree` plus the resolved rate itself as
`timer_hz_hex`. That rate also drives every `kernel_arch::busy_delay_us`
settle the in-kernel bring-up uses. The metal capture read
`timer_hz_from_tree=false timer_hz_hex=0x337_f980` — exactly the Pi 4's
54 MHz crystal — so `CNTFRQ_EL0` is correctly programmed and a
mis-programmed-rate over-wait is **ruled out** as the cause of the P10
multi-second USB bring-up pause. The `4116` "bring-up delay timing
measurement" (`keyboard_service` brackets the whole chain with
`kernel_arch::read_cntpct` and tallies its `GenericTimerDelay`'s requested
microseconds) read `requested_us_hex≈356 ms` (259 delay calls) yet
`counter_elapsed_us_hex≈14.3 s` at the correct 54 MHz — so ≈14 s of real
time elapsed with only ≈356 ms in `busy_delay_us`: the counter is sound and
the seconds are code-side, but `4116` alone cannot split *where* they go.
Two diagnostics localise it: `SerialSink` prefixes every line with a
monotonic `CNTPCT_EL0`-derived `[<secs>.<millis>]` stamp (`kernel_arch::uptime_ms`,
so a capture reads the real wall time between any two lines), and `build.rs`
emits `KERNEL_BUILD_ID` (git short hash + `+dirty` + `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`-aware
build epoch, §19.3), logged as `build_id` on the `4097` line so a capture
proves which build is running. That stamp is regenerated on **every** build:
`build.rs` declares no narrow `rerun-if-changed` and always re-runs (a metal
reflash therefore always shows a fresh epoch / current `+dirty` hash), because
the old narrow git-only rerun inputs left the id stale through a dirty-tree
edit so a reflash reported an old id for new code (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` still
pins it for a reproducible build, §19.3; the embedded `init`/driver fixtures
are re-validated by the same always-run, their `build-std` relink gated on an
actual `Run.ld` change). The timestamped capture (with `build_id`
confirming the current image) was **decisive** and corrected the earlier
un-timestamped guess: the caps-readiness wait (`4108`→`4109`) is only
~0.35 s — the `wait_for_caps_ready` *elapsed-wall-time* bound
(`CAPS_READY_BUDGET_US`≈256 ms via `Delay::now_us`, retained as a §2.16
defence) works, and `4109 polls_hex=0x100` is 256 *fast* reads (the BCM2711
master-abort returns the `dead_dead` poison in ~1.3 ms, not the ~54 ms first
inferred) — so the caps loop is **not** the pause. The ~14 s is almost
entirely inside `BrcmPcieRc::bring_up`: ~11.2 s between the RC-register-window
map (`4105 phys_base=fd50_0000`) and `4101 link trained`, with no log line
between, while bring_up's coded delays total only ~hundreds of ms and its
reads target the RC's own (fast) register block. The `4117` per-phase split
(`BringUpTiming` from the `Delay` clock, host-tested) then pinned the ~11 s
to the reset phase, then the reset sub-spans pinned it to the **first access
to the MISC register block** (`0x4xxx`). Early experiments that powered the SerDes or read link status before
cycling the bridge reset stalled identically — *every* early MISC
access master-aborts — refuting the SerDes-IDDQ theory. The
real gate is the controller reset — the BCM2711 holds the core off until the
always-accessible RGR1 bridge `sw_init` reset (`0x9210`) is cycled, which is
why the **same** `MISC_PCIE_STATUS` read costs ~8 µs in the config phase (the
reset having run by then) yet ~10.8 s before it. The BCM2711 PCIe bring-up sequence
never touches a MISC register before cycling the bridge reset.
**Fixed (host-proven; confirmed gone on metal):**
`BrcmPcieRc::reset_controller` cycles **only** the always-accessible RGR1
bridge `sw_init` reset (`0x9210`) — bringing the core and its MISC block
online — then lets the core and MISC block settle; the
`4117` capture confirmed `reset_swinit_us`/`reset_settle_us` collapse to
microseconds and the ~14 s pause is gone. The gentlest no-touch-probe
bring-up does **not** re-assert a fundamental reset or toggle the SerDes
`IDDQ` (either could drop the VL805 firmware the previous boot stage
loaded over the power-on link); `PERST#` is left as the handoff left it
and `train_link` deasserts it (the single `PERST#`-deassert edge that
re-triggers any `VideoCore` VL805 firmware reload
(see the firmware item below). (The Pi UART is the SoC's
own PL011/mini-UART — no path to the PCIe/VL805 — so logging cannot perturb
the controller.) `timer_clock_frequency` matches the
timer node through the shared `Fdt::nodes` early-returning walk (the same
byte-safe traversal `gic::configure_from_fdt` uses, §2.2) — **not** the
whole-tree `Fdt::property`/`walk` scan, which faults under the verticals'
MMU-off boot when the compiler widens the byte reads; reaching only the
matched node's own properties keeps discovery safe MMU-off. **Runtime
proof on `-M virt`:** the `sched_drive_qemu_aarch64` vertical now derives
the tick interval from `timer_frequency_hz(&fdt)` over the embedded `virt`
DTB and **poisons** the GIC base, rediscovering it (`configure_from_fdt`)
before `gic::init`, so the ≥ 20 timer ticks + ≥ 1 IPI that drive the live
`Scheduler` run over the *discovered* GIC base and frequency. The `virt`
tree omits `clock-frequency`, so the runtime path exercises the register
fallback while the override branch is host-unit-tested; honouring the Pi's
real 54 MHz crystal is an on-metal item (no `-M raspi4b` in QEMU — the
same gap as P2/P3). `cargo xtask cfg-check` stays clean.

### P5 — SMP bring-up on the Pi (PSCI vs spin-table)

- The board's start mechanism is discovered, never assumed: PSCI over
  the `/psci`-declared conduit when the node exists, else the
  Devicetree spin-table release the Pi 4's stock firmware declares
  (`enable-method = "spin-table"` + per-cpu `cpu-release-addr`), else
  fail closed to a single-CPU boot.

**Landed — both mechanisms.** The PSCI conduit is a *discovered* board
fact end to end. `fdt::psci_method` rides the shared `Fdt::nodes`
early-return walk (matching the `/psci` node by an `arm,psci`
`compatible` prefix and reading `method` from that node only), the same
byte-safe traversal `gic::configure_from_fdt` /
`fdt::timer_clock_frequency` use (§2.2) — safe on the MMU-off bring-up
path where a full-tree scan faults. `boot_aarch64` reads the mechanism
from the `x0` DTB — the `/psci` conduit when declared, else each
`/cpus/cpu@*` node's spin-table release word
(`tairix_fdt::CpuNode::spin_table_release`, dense-aligned by
`cpu_topology::align_release_addrs`) — installs it via
`Aarch64Arch::with_secondary_start`, and logs `smp_start_method`
(`psci`/`spin_table`/`none`); a tree declaring neither leaves the
mechanism unset, so the `SecondaryBringup` HAL fails closed
(`SmpError::NotReady`) rather than assuming one. **Runtime proof on
`-M virt`:** `ipi_smp_qemu_aarch64` *discovers* the conduit from the
embedded `virt` tree, asserts it is the board's `hvc`, fails closed
otherwise, and starts the secondary core + delivers a directed SGI over
*that* discovered conduit. Host tests cover the conduit read from both
the `virt` (`hvc`) and `raspi` (`smc`) fixtures, the fail-closed
no-`/psci` path, and the spin-table discovery (positive, wrong-method,
zero/malformed-address). The **spin-table release path is the metal
Pi 4 production path** (its stock firmware declares no `/psci`, which
left every secondary `smp_secondary_entry_not_installed`-dead before
this landed): `smp::start_secondary_spintable` writes the argument-free
`_start_secondary_spintable_aarch64` trampoline address to both the
firmware `cpu-release-addr` word and the kernel's own
`SECONDARY_KERNEL_RELEASE` word (the `_start` park loop now polls it —
formerly an unreleasable `wfe` loop), publishes the released core's
masked affinity in `SECONDARY_KERNEL_RELEASE_TARGET`, sweeps all three
to PoC, and `sev`s;
the trampoline drops from EL2 via the shared `_el2_establish_and_drop`
(factored out of `_start`, §2.2), recovers its dense id from the
published affinity table (`smp::register_secondary_affinities`, swept
to PoC by `prepare_secondary_bringup`), and joins the common PSCI
trampoline path; an undescribed affinity parks fail-closed. The
**production multi-core bring-up rides the discovered mechanism end to
end**: `boot_aarch64` sizes every per-CPU backing from the validated
`/cpus` dense map, `kernel_core::kernel_main` starts each secondary
after `BootCompleted` (audited
`SecondaryCpuStarted`/`StartFailed`/`Online`), and each core adopts the
boot translation and joins the shared kernel dispatch loop — proven by
the `-smp 4` `kernel-arch-boot-aarch64` vertical (see
`docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`). No `-M raspi4b` in the pinned QEMU, so
the end-to-end spin-table release is an on-metal acceptance item (the
same gap as P2/P3/P4); `cargo xtask cfg-check` stays clean.

Secondaries are brought up **serialised behind a per-core online
acknowledgement barrier** (`kernel_core::init::start_secondaries` +
`smp::SecondaryDispatch::mark_online`): the boot CPU releases one
secondary, waits (bounded via `monotonic_ns`, fail-loud `no_online_ack`)
for it to publish the online edge from `run_secondary` — set only after
that core has adopted the kernel translation regime and armed its per-CPU
interrupt state — then releases the next, and only returns to spawn PID 1
once all have checked in. This is a correctness requirement on real
hardware: the last-released core must finish bring-up before the boot CPU
mutates shared kernel state, or it faults mid-adopt (a cache/coherency
hazard cacheless QEMU never shows, seen on metal as the highest dense id
deterministically never coming online — present in the topology, zero
context switches).

Secondaries are **also** serialised against each other by a **per-core
release gate** on `SECONDARY_KERNEL_RELEASE_TARGET` (a `sev` wakes every
parked core at once — the kernel release word is shared and a firmware
spin-table `sev` likewise wakes every core still in the stub — so the
release must name exactly one core): `start_secondary_spintable`
publishes the affinity of the single core being released (swept to PoC
before the `sev`), and a woken core proceeds only when that target equals
its own masked affinity — the rest re-park. The gate is enforced at
**both** convergence points, against the one shared
`smp::release_gate_open` predicate: the `_start` park loop **and** the
`_start_secondary_spintable_aarch64` trampoline (the kernel never assumes
the firmware `cpu-release-addr` channel is per-core). The gate predicate
and its edge cases are host-tested (`smp_tests`); the parked-core polling
is assembly.

**Root cause (metal): a secondary's UNKNOWN power-on caches were never
invalidated before its data cache was enabled.** The cpu-labelled
beacons localised the death to `adopt_boot_translation` (core printed
`reached rust entry`/`fp enabled` then stopped before `mmu adopted`),
and the per-core state dump proved the inputs were identical and correct
across cores (same boot root, same MMU-off `SCTLR_EL1`, stacks differing
only by the 64 KiB stride). The failure was a **race**, not bad state:
deterministic-then-intermittent (~50/50) on the highest/last-released
core. On AArch64 a core's cache contents are architecturally UNKNOWN at
power-on; a freshly-released secondary can hold stale lines over the very
physical addresses TAIRiX now uses for the boot page tables and that
core's stack. TAIRiX enabled `SCTLR_EL1.C` on the secondary
(`program_stage1_translation`) **without first invalidating its local
D-cache**, so the first cacheable access after the MMU came on — the
translation-table walk or a stack access — intermittently read a stale
cache line shadowing DRAM and the core faulted with no vectors installed.
The boot CPU never hit this because firmware hands it clean caches. (The
earlier serialisation-gate and stack-mapping-coherency theories were both
disproven: core 3 entered Rust cleanly with a correct, PoC-coherent
`.bss`/low-RAM stack, and the boot CPU only spin-waits during bring-up.)

**Fix:** two complementary defences make the boot-root hand-off coherent
across the MMU-off/cacheable boundary. (1) The boot CPU publishes the
park root (`publish_park_root`) with a cacheable store but a secondary
reads it MMU-off, non-cacheably from DRAM, in `adopt_boot_translation`;
publication therefore cleans the park-root word to the point of coherency
(`dc civac`), or the store lingers in the boot CPU's write-back cache,
every secondary reads a stale zero, and each parks fail-closed with "no
boot root" (the observed on-metal symptom: all secondaries report "no
boot root" and the later release gets `no_online_ack`). (2)
`adopt_boot_translation` invalidates the calling core's local data cache
to the Level of Coherence (`paging`'s set/way
`_invalidate_local_dcache_to_poc`, `dc isw`) **before**
`program_stage1_translation` enables the MMU+caches. It is *invalidate*,
never clean: the stale lines hold no live data this core produced (every
prior access was MMU-off Device-nGnRnE, never cached), and cleaning would
write their garbage back over the live tables. Both are secondary-path
concerns — the boot CPU's `AddressSpace::switch` is otherwise unaffected —
so neither perturbs the single-CPU QEMU boot and both are safe on QEMU's
`cortex-a72` model. The end-to-end release remains on-metal-only (no
`-M raspi4b` in the pinned QEMU); acceptance is all four
`SecondaryCpuOnline` lines with core 3 scheduling across repeated boots.

### P6 — Spawn `init` into EL0 on the Pi

The user-mode milestone is the first time the *production* kernel reaches
EL0 on any arch (today only per-test fixtures do, via `spawn_and_enter`),
and the standing direction is to do it *properly*: `init` is a real Rust
program that parses a startup config and writes its first line to the
**console** — the detected framebuffer if any, else the first discovered
UART. That console line needs a real syscall (there was none), and
`init` "starting the user in a shell" needs a userland process-spawn
syscall (there is none). So P6 is staged into chunks, each landed green
on its own before the next.

- **P6a — `console_write` `abi-v1` syscall `[x]`.** New syscall number 11
  + `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` (id 18), the `SyscallSpec` row, the
  `kernel/syscall` dispatch arm + recomputed `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH`, the
  `kernel/core` `ConsoleWrite` seam (boot installs the device — framebuffer
  else first UART — defaulting to a fail-closed `NULL_CONSOLE` →
  `NotImplemented`) + the copy-in handler, the `tairix_sys_console_write`
  C stub, and the regenerated C header. `SYSCALL_NAME_MAX` bumped 12→13
  to fit the name. All host tests + `abi-check` + `c-header` green.
- **P6b — `tairix-init` becomes a real program `[x]`.** The `tairix-init`
  package now builds the `init` bundle's `Run` entry-point binary
  (`src/run.rs`, `AGENTS.md` §16.5) as a **pure-Rust** program. TAIRiX is
  Rust-only (`AGENTS.md` §1), so it links the new pure-Rust userland runtime
  `lib/rt` (`tairix-rt`) — **never** the C ABI (`crt0` + `abi-sys`), which
  exists solely for non-Rust programs (`AGENTS.md` §16.4). `tairix-rt`
  provides `_start`, the §19.2 stack canary, the panic handler, and idiomatic
  syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names the program's safe `main() ->
  i32`, which parses the compiled-in startup config and writes its first
  banner line through the P6a `console_write` syscall, the runtime routing the
  return through `exit`. Both `tairix-rt` and the C ABI reach the kernel
  through the **one** shared trap primitive `lib/abi-trap` (`tairix-abi-trap`,
  the §1 syscall/svc/ecall carve-out), so the trap assembly is not duplicated
  (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The **startup config** (`src/startup.rs`) is a tiny,
  allocation-free, host-tested text format with two required directives —
  `console` and `session <absolute-path>` — that fails closed on an
  unknown/duplicated directive, a wrong/missing argument, a non-absolute
  path, an over-long config, or an omitted directive (`AGENTS.md` §2.9,
  §19.5). The program links **only** the runtime and its own parser — never
  the orchestrator library, whose `alloc`+crypto chain would be §2.3 bloat —
  so the parser lives beside the binary and the shipped image carries no
  crypto and **no `unsafe`** (verified: the linked aarch64 PIE exports
  `_start`/`__tairix_rt_main`/`rust_rt_start` and the mangled
  `tairix_rt::console_write`, with zero `tairix_sys_*` and zero crypto symbols).
  A self-contained `build.rs` sets the `freestanding` cfg from `target_os`
  only (no `target_arch`, so `cfg-check` stays clean; no dependency on the
  tests harness, so §17.4 layering stays clean); `Run.ld` mirrors the proven
  PIE link layout — the one shared `lib/rt/Run.ld` the userland runtimes
  link. Host DoD green (3 new
  `tairix-rt` tests + 10 startup-config tests + the freestanding aarch64 build
  via `build-std=core,alloc,compiler_builtins`). The end-to-end EL0 spawn of
  this binary is P6c.
- **P6c — production boot reaches EL0 `[x]`.** Wire the freestanding
  aarch64 `tairix-kernel` boot path through `kernel/{mem,ipc,sec,syscall}`
  over the discovered `/memory` map, install the console (discovered
  framebuffer else first UART) via `with_console`, embed the `init` rxe,
  and spawn PID 1 into EL0 via the `userentry` `eret` path. Add a `-M virt`
  vertical asserting the EL0 transition + the `init` banner on the
  discovered UART. This is the largest P6 step — it stands up the aarch64
  production runtime *and* the OS's first production-boot→EL0 spawn (no arch
  reaches user mode from `kernel_main` today; `kernel_core::kernel_main`
  halts after `BootCompleted`) — so it is landed in sub-increments, each
  green over the whole project on its own:
  - **P6c-1 — discovered `/memory` → `BootMemoryMap` `[x]`.** The aarch64
    boot path turns the firmware-discovered RAM window + the linker
    `__kernel_end` into the canonical two-region physical map the live
    allocator hand-off consumes (reserve `[ram_base, __kernel_end)`,
    page-align the rest usable), the riscv64 boot pipeline's
    `build_memory_map` analogue. The bounds/overflow arithmetic lives in a
    host-tested `tairix_kernel::mem_map` module (8 unit tests; gated to the
    aarch64 build and `cargo test` so it is never dead code, §2.3) because
    the bare-metal `boot_aarch64` cannot be host-compiled. The boot audit
    line now records `mem_map_built` / `mem_map_status` /
    `usable_bytes_hex` / `reserved_bytes_hex`, failing closed to a status
    string (never a panic, §2.9) on an absent or malformed window.
  - **P6c-2 — MMU + `kernel_main` hand-off `[x]`.** `boot_aarch64`
    discovers the console + GIC bases MMU-off (early-return walks),
    derives the identity map's Device gigapage mask from them
    (`paging::identity_device_mask` — discovered MMIO gigapages Device,
    the kernel image's own gigapages Normal/executable; `virt`: GiB 0
    Device, Pi 4: GiB 3 Device with the kernel at `0x8_0000` in a Normal
    GiB 0), installs it via `paging::configure_device_gigapages`, then
    enables the stage-1 identity MMU
    (`AddressSpace::new_identity_gigapages` over a static boot
    `PageTablePool`, 512×1 GiB, then `switch`) and installs the EL1
    vectors *before* any further work, so the `kernel_core`
    allocator/scheduler atomics run on Normal memory and the full-tree
    `first_memory_region` FDT walk is MMU-on-safe (the §watch-out
    hazard). The boot audit line records `device_gigapages_hex`
    (`virt`: `0x1`; Pi 4: `0x8`). It adds the local `Aarch64BinArch`
    `KernelArch` wrapper (orphan-rule sibling of the x86_64 `BinArch` /
    riscv64 `RiscvBinArch`), a slot-based aarch64 `production_dispatch` +
    `DISPATCH_SLOT` (the shared arch-neutral frame-read / errno-encode /
    slot-forward logic factored into a host-tested `dispatch_core` module,
    §2.2), a `UartConsole` `ConsoleWrite` over the discovered UART
    (`serial::write_console_bytes`), and hands a validated `BootInfo`
    (`.with_console(&UART_CONSOLE)`) to `kernel_core::kernel_main` — so the
    aarch64 production kernel reaches `BootCompleted` like x86_64/riscv64,
    or parks fail-closed (§2.9) on an unsound hand-off. `kernel/core` grew
    a `BootInfo.console` field + `with_console` builder (default
    fail-closed `NULL_CONSOLE`) threaded into `KernelDispatchHook::new`. The
    `kernel_arch_boot_aarch64` vertical now boots the *production* pipeline
    to `AuditEvent::BootCompleted` on `-M virt` (embedded `virt` DTB; QEMU
    passes no `x0`). `boot.rs::main` passes `&SERIAL_SINK` as both sinks.
  - **P6c-3 — embed `init` rxe + spawn PID 1 into EL0 `[x]`.** The
    `tairix-kernel` build script compiles the pure-Rust `tairix-init-run`
    `Run` binary PIE (the one shared `lib/rt/Run.ld`) and converts the linked
    ELF to an
    embedded `rxe` blob with `tairix_itest_harness::elf2rxe` (stamped with
    the kernel's `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH`, biased to 64 GiB) — the same path the
    cc3/spawn fixtures use (§2.2; host-only build glue, TAIRiX stays
    Rust-only §1). `kernel/core` gained an arch-neutral PID-1 spawn seam:
    `BootInfo.init: Option<&dyn InitSpawn>` + `with_init`, invoked by
    `kernel_main` after `BootCompleted`; the object-safe `InitSpawnCtx`
    (`frames`/`audit`/`admit_init`) lets the arch seam build the image
    (`spawn_image` — the new authorise+build+`ProcessSpawned`-audit half of
    `spawn_and_enter`, no enter) while the core registers PID 1 with the
    scheduler + capability table and dispatches it. The aarch64
    `init_spawn` seam builds an identity user address space whose window
    is derived from the configured Device/RAM gigapage masks
    (`paging::configured_identity_gigapages` — 2 GiB on `virt`, 4 GiB on
    the Pi 4, whose UART/GIC live in gigapage 3; the 64 GiB bias avoids
    the gigapage collision), parses the embedded `rxe`, and
    boxes the `userentry` `eret` as the scheduler task body; the body runs
    under `step` so the per-CPU `current_task` is set when `init`'s first
    `svc` traps back. PID 1 runs as uid 0 with `{CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE}`. The
    `spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` `-M virt` vertical asserts the EL0 transition:
    `ProcessSpawned` (4030) → `SyscallInvoked` (5000, `init`'s audited
    `exit`) → semihosting PASS. **Locking fix:** the production
    `KernelDispatchHook` now snapshots the caller's caps and drops the read
    guard before dispatch, so the caps-mutating handlers (`exit`,
    `cap_delegate`, `cap_revoke` — all take `caps.write()`) no longer
    self-deadlock the writer-preference `RwLock` (a latent bug, since no
    arch reached EL0 through the real hook before).
  - **P6c-3 follow-up — registry-storable address space; the `init` banner
    prints `[x]`.** An arch `AddressSpace<P>` is `!Sync` (owns a `&'static
    mut` root + a non-`Sync` page-table source), so it could not be stored
    in the `Send+Sync`, lock-shared `AddressSpaceRegistry`, and PID 1's
    `console_write` user-copy resolved no address space and failed closed
    with `BadAddress`. Added `AddressSpace::freeze()` → `FrozenAddressSpace`
    in `kernel/mem`: a `Send+Sync` POD snapshot walking every live page
    through `translate` into a `BTreeMap<Page,(Frame,MapFlags)>`, so it
    answers the copy path's permission checks identically to the live space.
    `InitSpawnCtx::admit_init` now also takes the boxed frozen view + boxed
    `DirectPhysMap`; `KernelInitSpawner` registers them under
    `SecTaskId(task_id)` in `&state.aspaces` (fail-closed on a duplicate
    id), and the aarch64 `init_spawn` seam freezes `space` after
    `spawn_image` and passes both. `init`'s `run.rs` now gates its `exit` on
    a full-length `console_write` (parks fail-closed otherwise, §2.9), so
    the `spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` vertical's PASS (keyed on the audited
    `exit` 5000 — `console_write` is `audit:false`) now genuinely proves the
    banner reached the console (`-M virt`, verified green).
- **P6d — userland process-spawn syscall `[x]`.** Add the `abi-v1`
  spawn syscall (gated by `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`, already reserved at id 17) +
  an embedded-program registry so `init` can launch a separate process.
  Per the standing direction this is being done *properly* — a real
  concurrent process (its own isolated address space, scheduled
  independently), not an `exec`-style hand-off — which requires real
  kernel-thread EL0↔EL0 context switching the kernel does not have yet.
  So P6d is itself staged in **`plans/SPAWN.md`** (SP0 design; SP1
  kernel-thread task runtime wiring the existing `ContextSwitch` HAL into
  the live scheduler; SP2 resumable EL0 tasks that timeshare a CPU; SP3
  the `spawn` syscall #12 + embedded-program registry; SP4 `init` launches
  the `session` process — overlapping P6e). Each `SP`-stage lands green
  over the whole project on its own. **SP0, SP1, SP2a, SP2b, and SP2c are
  landed, so SP2 is complete on aarch64:** the SP0 design note is
  `docs/src/architecture/multitasking.md`, and the `kernel/core::kthread`
  runtime (`spawn_kthread`, the `Yielder`, the per-task kernel stack) is
  host-tested and proven on `-M virt` by
  `tests/integration/kthread_switch_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}` — two
  kthreads ping-pong through the real `ContextSwitch::switch`, now a
  production scheduling path on every arch. (The x86_64 sibling was the
  first on-metal first-resume into a real Rust trampoline and surfaced a
  latent `TaskCtx::prepare` rdi-slot + stack-alignment bug, now fixed.)
  SP2a added the arch-neutral EL0-reschedule machinery, and **SP2b makes
  PID 1 reach EL0 as a resumable user kthread**: `KernelArch` exposes a
  `ContextSwitch` (`type Cs` + `context_switch()`), the aarch64 port gained
  `paging::activate_user_root` for the per-task `pre_resume` hook,
  `InitSpawnCtx::admit_init` admits PID 1 via `spawn_user_kthread`, and the
  `KernelDispatchHook` producer maps `yield`/`exit` to a `Reschedule`
  outcome (the handlers no longer drive the scheduler directly). The
  production `spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` vertical reaches EL0 through that
  full path. **SP2c then proves two EL0 user tasks timeshare one CPU**:
  the new `tests/integration/spawn_el0_timeshare_qemu_aarch64` vertical
  builds two hardware-isolated EL0 address spaces from the pure-Rust
  `tairix-test-el0-yielder` fixture (it links the new `tairix_rt::yield_now`
  wrapper), admits each as a resumable user kthread via `spawn_user_kthread`,
  and drains the cooperative `step` loop while a dispatch callback maps each
  task's `yield`/`exit` to `reschedule_current` — verified green on `-M
  virt`. **SP3 (the `spawn` syscall #12 + embedded-program registry) is
  staged SP3a/SP3b; SP3a is landed:** the `abi-v1` `spawn` syscall #12
  (`CAP_PROC_SPAWN`, audited) is wired end to end — `lib/abi` row + frozen
  tests, the `tairix_sys_spawn` C stub + regenerated header, the
  `kernel/syscall` dispatch arm + recomputed `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH` — plus
  the `kernel/core` path-keyed `ProgramRegistry` and the fail-closed
  `ProcessSpawn`/`SpawnCtx` seam (default `NULL_PROCESS_SPAWN` →
  `NotImplemented`, mirroring `NULL_CONSOLE`). The `spawn` handler
  copies-in the path, resolves it, and admits a **Ready** resumable user
  kthread through `SpawnCtx::admit_process` (host-proven by a `ProcessSpawn`
  double + 8 host tests). **SP3b and SP4 are now landed too, so P6d is
  complete:** the real aarch64 `ProcessSpawn` producer
  (`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/spawn_producer.rs`) builds each child a fresh,
  hardware-isolated identity address space (window mask-derived, as PID
  1's) whose page tables come from
  the kernel's live `FrameAllocator` through a boot-cached `kernel/mem`
  `FrameTableSource` (§24.1 — no fixed reserve, capacity scales with RAM;
  without switching the spawning caller's `TTBR0_EL1`), drives the audited
  `spawn_image` + `admit_process`, and is
  installed via `BootInfo::with_spawn`; the kernel `build.rs` now embeds both
  `init` and the `Shell` session program through one `elf2rxe` helper. PID 1
  `init` (granted `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`) spawns `config.session()`
  (`/System/Commands/elsh.app/Run`) through `tairix_rt::spawn` and keeps running; the
  `tests/integration/spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` vertical proves both
  processes run on `-M virt` (PASS on two `ProcessSpawned` + three audited
  syscalls — the session's gated banner+exit is necessarily last).
- **P6e — real shell REPL + session supervision `[x]`.** The `session`
  program `init` launches is currently a banner+exit `Run` stub in the
  `Shell` bundle; P6e wires the existing `tairix-elsh` interpreter library
  into it (a real REPL) and has `init` supervise the session across its
  lifetime (restart, reap). **Design correction (binding, AGENTS.md §20):**
  the shell must do its text I/O over its **inherited standard streams
  (fd 0 `stdin` / fd 1 `stdout` / fd 2 `stderr` / fd 3 `stdinfo`)**, *not*
  over the kernel-discovered console via `console_read`/`console_write`.
  Binding the REPL to the discovered console hard-codes "whichever console
  the kernel found" into the shell — ambient authority (§4) and hidden
  device coupling (§17.3/§17.4). Reading fd 0 / writing fd 1 makes the same
  `tairix-elsh` binary "just work" whether started on a UART, a
  framebuffer console, a network socket, or a WM terminal surface, with
  **zero** shell-side changes — only the *backing* of its descriptors
  differs. The gap this exposes: `abi-v1`'s startup vector
  (`lib/abi/src/process.rs`) carries args/env/canary but **no descriptor
  table** — there is no notion of inherited streams yet. So P6e is staged
  so that P6e-1/P6e-2 build the device *backing* and P6e-3a adds the
  stream layer the shell actually binds to:
  - **P6e-1 — `console_read` `abi-v1` syscall + kernel seam `[x]`.** The
    input counterpart of P6a's `console_write`, and — together with it —
    reframed as the bootstrap **device backing** the stream layer attaches
    to fd 0/1, *not* the shell's interface (AGENTS.md §20). Syscall **#13**
    (`SyscallNumber::CONSOLE_READ`) gated by the new
    `CapabilityId::CONSOLE_READ` (**id 19**), appended to the `lib/abi`
    source of truth (table row, regenerated C header, recomputed
    `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH`). A `ConsoleRead` seam in `kernel/core::console`
    (default `NULL_CONSOLE_READ`, fail-closed `NotImplemented`, installed
    via `BootInfo::with_console_read`) and a `console_read` handler that
    reads into a bounded (`CONSOLE_READ_MAX`) kernel staging buffer and
    `copy_out`s to the caller (short/zero reads valid, defensive clamp,
    `BadAddress` on a faulting/unregistered caller). `lib/rt::console_read`
    + `lib/abi-sys::tairix_sys_console_read` wrappers. Host-proven by 7
    `kernel/core` tests + the rt/abi-sys/abi drift+marshalling tests; the
    dispatcher reachability/fuzz/proptest doubles gained the new arm. **No
    device read is wired yet** — the aarch64 serial has no RX primitive, so
    `console_read` fails closed everywhere until P6e-2.
  - **P6e-2 — UART RX device + wiring `[x]`.** A non-blocking
    console-input read primitive was added to the aarch64 serial path:
    `ConsoleModel::rx_ready` decodes each model's receive-status bit
    (PL011 `UARTFR.RXFE` set = FIFO empty; mini-UART `AUX_MU_LSR_REG`
    bit 0 set = data ready), reusing the existing data/status offsets
    since the RX registers coincide with TX on both models;
    `serial::getchar`/`read_console_bytes` drain the RX FIFO into the
    caller's buffer and stop at the first absent byte — no busy-wait
    (§2.1), so an empty read is a valid zero-length short read. The
    zero-sized `UartConsole` now implements `ConsoleRead` (`Ok(0)` inert
    on host), and `boot_aarch64::enter_kernel_core` installs it through
    `BootInfo::with_console_read(&UART_CONSOLE)` beside the existing
    `.with_console`; kernel-core's init pipeline wraps whatever device the
    boot path installed in `BlockingConsoleRead`
    (`kernel/core/src/console.rs`), which parks an empty-handed
    `stream_read` caller on the scheduler (`reschedule_current`, the
    `wait`-syscall poll-and-park loop) and re-polls on redispatch — the
    backing owns blocking (§20), so user space never sees a spurious
    end-of-input. This completes the **bootstrap backing** — it feeds
    fd 0's backing object (P6e-3a), it is **not** called directly by the
    shell. The receive-bit decoders are host-unit-tested (2 new
    `console` tests + 1 `aarch64::arch_wrapper` adapter test); the
    freestanding aarch64 kernel builds clean.
  - **P6e-3a — standard-stream ABI + fd table `[x]`.** The two console
    syscalls were evolved **in place** (§2.13) into fd-keyed stream ops:
    `stream_write(fd, buf, len)` (#11) and `stream_read(fd, buf, len)`
    (#13), arg_count 3 with a leading `U32 fd`, appended-row-stable
    capabilities (`CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE`/`CAP_CONSOLE_READ` kept as the coarse
    "may use a console-backed stream" gate). `lib/abi/src/process.rs` gained
    the per-process descriptor model — `STDIN`/`STDOUT`/`STDERR`/`STDINFO`,
    `STD_STREAM_COUNT`, `StreamMode{Closed,Read,Write}`, and `DescriptorTable`
    (`closed()`/`standard()`/`mode()`) — established at spawn and held per
    task in `AddressSpaceRegistry` (new `set_streams`/`streams`, cleared on
    `withdraw`). The `stream_write`/`stream_read` handlers resolve `fd`
    against the caller's table **before** any state and fail closed with
    `NotFound` unless the direction matches; both production admit paths
    (`admit_init`, `admit_process`) install `DescriptorTable::standard()`, so
    a process's fd 0 reads / fd 1/2/3 write the discovered console the boot
    path installed (the P6e-1/P6e-2 UART backing **reused behind the
    stream**, not exposed). `lib/rt` exposes the standard streams over fd
    0/1/2/3 through its `io` trait layer (`console_*` removed); `lib/abi-sys`
    exports `tairix_sys_stream_write`/`tairix_sys_stream_read`; `init` + the
    `Shell` session write their banner via `tairix_rt::io::Stdout`. C header regenerated
    (`TAIRIX_SYS_STREAM_WRITE`/`_READ`) and `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH` recomputed
    (`1cfbad…`); the abi-check + c-header drift guards are green. Proven
    host-side (the `lib/abi` descriptor-table tests, the `aspace` stream-map
    tests, the 11 reworked + 3 new `kernel/core` handler gate tests, the
    rt/abi-sys fd-marshalling tests) and on `-M virt`: the
    `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` vertical now proves a spawned child writes
    fd 1 over the discovered-UART backing (the shell banner lands on fd 1).
    Whole-project gate (fmt / `cargo xtask ci` / `fuzz --secs 5`
    / `soak.sh both` / `cargo xtask test --qemu`) **green on this host**.
    Real UART **RX** over fd 0 on silicon remains an on-metal item (no
    deterministic `-M virt` serial-RX injection, consistent with P6e-2).
  - **P6e-3b — shell REPL over its streams + `init` supervision `[x]`.**
    Wire `tairix-elsh` to read fd 0 / write fd 1 (and emit `stdinfo` on
    fd 3 per §20) through the `lib/rt` standard-stream wrappers, with
    `init` supervising the session (restart, reap). The shell contains
    **no** reference to `console_*` or to any device. Staged into the REPL
    itself (P6e-3b-i) and `init` supervision (P6e-3b-ii) — **both landed**.
    - **P6e-3b-i — shell REPL over fd 0/1/2/3 `[x]`.** The `Shell` bundle's
      `Run` binary (`userland/shell/elsh/src/run.rs`) no longer prints a
      banner and exits: it runs the sibling `tairix-elsh` interpreter as a
      read-eval-print loop (the new `repl` lib module) over its **inherited
      standard streams** (`AGENTS.md` §20). `repl::run` reads command lines
      from fd 0 (`tairix_rt::io::Stdin`, reassembling lines across reads,
      stripping CRLF, capping a line at 4 KiB and discarding an over-length
      line), runs each through `Shell::run_line`, writes the prompt + output
      to fd 1/2 through the `RtConsole` seam, and emits one `omission`
      `StdInfoRecord` on fd 3 when a line is dropped (§20.1). It binds to fd
      0/1/2/3 only — **no** `console_*` or device reference (ambient authority
      §4 / hidden coupling §17.3/§17.4). A zero-length read is end of input
      (clean exit); *blocking* is the stream backing's job (§20), and the
      kernel-core `BlockingConsoleRead` backing provides it (P6e-2), so an
      interactive session sits at its prompt until input arrives. The
      `RtProcessHost` launches commands via `spawn` + reaps via `wait`
      (args/env, signals, `cd`, and — since `plans/SPAWN.md` SP10 —
      pipelines and redirections all run end to end; only the `{var}`
      dynamic descriptors, fd ≥ 10, stay refused closed).
      `lib/abi` gained a tested `Errno::from_i32` decoder
      (single source of truth, §2.2; no C-header/hash impact — a method, not
      an ABI type change); the shared `lib/rt` read primitive surfaces a
      negative `-errno` as its typed `Errno` (never as a zero-length read that
      would read as end of input) and clamps the count to `buf.len()`
      (defence in depth, §5.4). Host-proven (6 new `repl` tests over scripted
      stdin/stdinfo + `Console`/`ProcessHost` fixtures; the `lib/rt` stream
      primitive tests; the `Errno::from_i32` round-trip test) and freestanding-built on
      all three bare-metal targets; the `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` vertical
      proves the interactive loop (the session blocks at its prompt and the
      runner types a scripted `exit\n` at the guest's serial input). Docs:
      `docs/src/userland/shell.md`.
    - **P6e-3b-ii — `init` session supervision `[x]`.** PID 1 `init` no
      longer spawns-and-forgets the session: `userland/system/init/src/run.rs`
      now runs a fail-closed **supervise loop** — `spawn` the session, `wait`
      on exactly that child (blocking until it exits, reaping it), then
      relaunch it. The loop is bounded by a small `SESSION_SPAWN_BUDGET`
      crash-loop guard: a session that blocks on input runs for PID 1's whole
      life and never approaches it, but one that exits instantly (no input
      backing) stops the loop at `EXIT_SESSION_EXHAUSTED` rather than
      busy-spinning on `spawn` (`AGENTS.md` §2.1). A refused `spawn` is
      fail-loud but never boot-fatal (§2.24): the refusal is reported on
      `stderr` and only that entry's slot abandoned, while a failed `wait`
      still ends the run (`EXIT_WAIT_FAILED`, §2.9). The
      userland + kernel-bookkeeping pieces were already wired — the production
      aarch64 pipeline wires the `KernelProcessWait` producer
      (`kernel_core::run_phases`), the `spawn` admit path's `register_child`,
      and the `exit` handler's `record_exit`, and `admit_init`'s drive loop
      re-dispatches the parked `init` after the session exits — but the
      supervise loop exposed a latent **aarch64 arch defect** that hung the
      vertical (see the errata below). This changes `init`'s audited-syscall
      sequence, so the `-M virt` vertical assertions were reworked:
      `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` now keys PASS on **three** `ProcessSpawned`
      (init + two session launches — the second launch proves the first was
      reaped and relaunched) + **four** audited syscalls (`init`'s `spawn`,
      `init`'s `wait`, the session's `exit`, `init`'s second `spawn`); the
      sibling `spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` still PASSes (its witness is now
      `init`'s first audited syscall, the `spawn`, instead of an `exit`) and
      its doc was updated. The session now **blocks** on fd 0 (the kernel-core
      `BlockingConsoleRead` backing) instead of exiting at end-of-input, and
      the runner gained deterministic `-M virt` serial-RX injection
      (`SerialInjection`: pipe QEMU stdin, type a scripted line once the
      guest prints its prompt marker), so the vertical exercises the full
      interactive cycle: prompt → injected `exit\n` → reap → relaunch → the
      second session blocks at its prompt. The session's capability set is
      `{CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE, CAP_CONSOLE_READ}` on every port (§2.2); ports
      with no console-read backing (x86_64, riscv64) keep failing closed at
      `NULL_CONSOLE_READ`, so their session verticals still witness the
      EOF-exit supervision path. Docs: `docs/src/userland/init.md` ("Session
      supervision").
    - **Errata — aarch64 exception return-state save/restore `[x]`.** The
      P6e-3b-ii supervise loop hung the `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` vertical
      (`Outcome::Timeout`): `init`'s `wait` reaped the session and returned,
      but `init` never reached its relaunch `spawn`. Root cause was a latent
      defect in the aarch64 EL1 exception trampoline (`kernel/arch/aarch64/
      src/vectors.s`): it saved only `x0..x30`, **not** `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/
      `SP_EL0`, relying on the live system registers across `eret`. That holds
      only when a handler returns directly — but a parked `wait`/`yield`
      (SP2) suspends the task **mid-handler** and switches to another task,
      whose own trap/`eret` clobbers those registers, so the resuming
      exception `eret`ed `init` to the session's PC/stack. (The SP2c
      `spawn_el0_timeshare` vertical masked it: two *identical* programs at
      identical VAs resume "correctly" at the wrong-but-equal PC.) Fix: the
      common trampoline now saves `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/`SP_EL0` into an
      enlarged 288-byte per-exception frame (GP-register offsets unchanged —
      the `[u64; SAVED_GPRS]` syscall view is intact) and writes them back
      before `eret`, making every exception's resume self-contained across a
      cooperative context switch. `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` now PASSes
      (3 `ProcessSpawned` + 4 audited syscalls). The riscv64/x86_64 trap
      vectors carry the same latent pattern but have no EL0 spawn/wait
      timeshare path wired yet, so it is unreachable there today and is
      folded into those ports' user-mode bring-up follow-ons. Docs:
      `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` (Interrupts).
    - **Prerequisite — `lib/rt` `mem_map`-backed `#[global_allocator]`
      `[x]`.** The `tairix-elsh` interpreter is `no_std + alloc`, but the
      freestanding userland runtime had no heap, so the shell could not link
      it. `lib/rt` now registers a `#[global_allocator]`
      (`lib/rt/src/heap.rs`): a free-span allocator over a fixed-base virtual
      arena that grows by `mem_map(FIXED)` and shrinks by `mem_unmap`,
      first-fit with alignment-padding return + neighbour coalescing, real
      free, deterministic-OOM-to-null (`AGENTS.md` §4/§2.9), no re-zero on
      free (the kernel already zeroes on map/free, §2.16). The pure free-span
      bookkeeping is host-unit-tested over a fake pager; the aarch64 `-M virt`
      vertical `tests/integration/heap_qemu_aarch64` proves it end to end — a
      pure-Rust EL0 fixture (`tests/integration/heap_program`) Box-allocates,
      grows a `Vec` across pages, reallocates after freeing, verifies every
      value, and exits 0 (PASS), with the allocator-issued `mem_map`/
      `mem_unmap` `svc`s routed through the live `MemMap` producer.
      **Verified green under QEMU on `-M virt`.** Design note:
      `docs/src/architecture/memory.md` §7d. This unblocks the REPL; the REPL
      itself + `init` supervision (which also needs a process-wait syscall)
      remain.
    - **Prerequisite — `wait` process-wait syscall (SP6) `[x]`.** Both the
      shell's foreground job control and `init` supervising the session
      (reap, restart) need a way to block on and reap a child — `spawn` was
      spawn-and-forget. **SP6 is COMPLETE** (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP6): SP6a
      landed the `abi-v1` surface (`SyscallNumber::WAIT` #16 + `WAIT_PID_ANY`, the
      `wait(I32 pid, UserPtr status) -> U64` row, unprivileged + audited),
      the `tairix_sys_wait` C stub + regenerated header, the `tairix_rt::wait`
      wrapper, the `kernel/syscall` dispatch arm + doubles, and the
      fail-closed `kernel/core::procwait::ProcessWait` seam + handler. **SP6b
      (this session)** landed the scheduler-side producer: the `ProcessWait`
      trait gained default-no-op `register_child`/`record_exit` hooks (so the
      null default + test doubles stay inert and no `new()` churn), the real
      `KernelProcessWait<A>` owns a `SpinLock<ProcessTable>` and blocks a
      waiting parent by cooperatively parking it via `reschedule_current(…,
      Yield)` until a child is reapable (fail-closed `NotImplemented` if no
      user kthread is published — never a busy-spin), `exit` records the code,
      the `spawn` admit path registers the parent→child link, and `run_phases`
      installs the producer via the hook's new `with_process_wait`. The
      aarch64 `-M virt` vertical `tests/integration/wait_qemu_aarch64` (+ the
      two-role `tests/integration/wait_program` fixture) proves a parent reaps
      a child that exited with a known code and reads it back, exiting 0 —
      **verified green under QEMU on `-M virt`**. This unblocks the REPL +
      `init` supervision.

**Done when:** under `-M raspi4b`, the kernel reaches `init` in EL0 and
`init` emits its first line on the console (framebuffer if present, else
the discovered UART), then starts the user's shell; a vertical asserts the
EL0 transition + the `init` banner. (This is the "boot into user mode"
milestone.)

**Landed (proven on `-M virt`).** All of P6a–P6e are `[x]`: the production
aarch64 kernel reaches EL0, PID 1 `init` writes its banner over its
inherited `stdout`, launches the `Shell` session through the `spawn`
syscall, and now **supervises** it (`spawn`→`wait`/reap→relaunch). The EL0
transition + banner are proven by `spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` and the
supervision by `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64`, both on `-M virt` — QEMU 8.2.2
has no `raspi4b` and `raspi*` performs no DTB hand-off (the standing P2
gap), so the `-M raspi4b` form of this gate is an on-metal acceptance item.

**P6 follow-on — SP5 `mem_map`/`mem_unmap` (runtime anonymous memory).**
A spawned process otherwise has only its fixed spawn-time image, so it
cannot obtain a heap; SP5 (`plans/SPAWN.md`) adds the `mmap`-style
anonymous map/unmap pair a future `lib/rt` `malloc`/`free` layers over.
**SP5-0 (design note) and SP5a (the `abi-v1` surface + fail-closed seam)
are landed:** `SyscallNumber::MEM_MAP` (#14) / `MEM_UNMAP` (#15), the
`MapFlags` type (with `FIXED`), the appended `Errno::OutOfMemory` (#20),
the `tairix_sys_mem_map`/`tairix_sys_mem_unmap` C stubs + regenerated header,
the dispatcher arms, and `kernel/core`'s `MemMap` seam (`NULL_MEM_MAP` /
`with_mem_map`, unprivileged + unaudited, fail-closed `NotImplemented`).
**SP5b-1 is also landed:** the reusable, host-proven `kernel/mem::anon`
live-address-space producer (`map_anonymous`/`unmap_anonymous` — zero on
map/free, W^X `RW|USER`, deterministic OOM, fail-closed all-or-nothing
reclaim, per-page TLB flush). **SP5b-2 is also landed (SP5 complete):** the
aarch64 `-M virt` EL0 vertical `tests/integration/mem_map_qemu_aarch64`
wires the producer through the `kernel/core` `MemMap` seam — it builds one
isolated EL0 space with `spawn_image`, **retains** it live behind a `MemMap`
producer over `map_anonymous`/`unmap_anonymous`, admits the program as a
resumable user kthread, and routes the program's `mem_map`/`mem_unmap`
`svc`s through it; the pure-Rust EL0 fixture
`tests/integration/mem_map_program` (linking the new
`tairix_rt::mem_map`/`mem_unmap` wrappers) maps a region (FIXED),
writes+verifies a pattern, unmaps it, then faults on use — the fault handler
reports PASS, **verified green under QEMU on `-M virt`**. The **riscv64
sibling `tests/integration/mem_map_qemu_riscv64` is now landed too**: it
reuses the same pure-Rust `mem_map_program` fixture and the same
`kernel/mem::anon` producer over an Sv39 U-mode space, but drops into the
program through `spawn_image` + a direct `EnterUser::enter_user` (a single
task that only direct-returns from its `ecall`s, so the riscv64
cooperative-switch trap-save path stays off the critical path) and reports
the use-after-unmap page fault as PASS on `-M virt` (ids 4284–4287, **verified
green on this host**). The x86_64 sibling + production per-task live-space
retention still follow.

**P6 follow-on — kthread kernel-stack guard page.** The deep-`wait`-handler
overrun that silently corrupted the next task's snapshot (P6e-3b-ii) is now
defended: `kernel/core::kthread::BoxStack` carries a poison-filled guard
page immediately *below* the usable stack and `dispatch_step` verifies its
canary on every switch-back, failing the task closed on an overrun rather
than letting it reach the heap neighbour (`AGENTS.md` §4 / §2.9 / §2.17,
host-proven; the same emulation `kernel/mem`'s slab guard documents). **This
is the real, non-deferred defence — not the old 64 KiB limit bump.** The
*deployment* form, which turns the overrun into an immediate hardware fault
instead of a next-reschedule detection, is now **landed `[x]`** (G1–G3c):
The deployment form — turning the overrun into an immediate hardware fault
instead of a next-reschedule detection — is **landed on every port `[x]`**,
and not by splitting a live block.

A kthread kernel stack is a run of pages in the **shared kernel remap
window** (`kernel/mem::KernelVirtMap`), laid out `[guard slot | usable
stack]` with the guard slot reserved and never mapped. The window's
sub-hierarchy is installed by every translation root, so the guard is absent
in all of them at once: no root refines a block for it, none carries a
per-task unmap, and a stack overrun faults synchronously under whichever
root the task runs. The tier is architecture-neutral
(`kernel/core::kstack`), installed from the one boot site that also installs
the heap's growth source, and sized as a share of the window derived from
discovered RAM (§24.1). Every kthread stack — PID 1's, a `thread_create`'s,
a deferred load's — comes from `kstack::alloc_kernel_stack`; a build with no
remap window keeps the poison-canary `BoxStack`, fail closed, never an
unguarded stack.

The earlier staged design refined the coarse identity block covering a
guard page in each task's own root, over a boot-carved physical arena. That
was a break-before-make violation
on a live translation regime — a granule change the architecture leaves
undefined, bounded by a whole-regime invalidation but not removed by it —
and it had to be repeated per root, including for blocks an arena chained
after a root was already live. The window form removes the violation rather
than bounding it, so the split primitive, the arena, and the physical carve
are all deleted (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D81, D82).

The fault form is proven on all three ports by
`tests/integration/stack_overrun_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}`: a kthread
admitted on a tier-drawn stack through the production
`spawn_kthread_with_stack` writes the highest byte of its guard slot — the
first byte a contiguous downward overrun crosses — and the unmapped slot
raises a synchronous fault *while the kthread runs*, which each port's fault
handler confirms by cause and faulting address. Each vertical first checks
the stack really came from the window, so a silent degrade to the
software-canary fallback fails the test rather than passing it. Docs:
`docs/src/platform/{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}.md`.

### X — x86_64 concurrent user mode: timeshare → spawn → wait (P6 cross-port follow-on) `[x]`

**x86_64 now reaches a full concurrent, multi-process user mode** to match
aarch64 (SP2c EL0 timeshare, SP3b/SP4 `spawn`, SP6 `wait`): X1–X4 and the X4
follow-on are all `[x]`, so PID 1 `init` spawns the session, reaps it, and
relaunches it under the live scheduler on x86_64 (`spawn_session_qemu_x86_64`,
3/4). The **riscv64** timeshare sibling is the remaining cross-port follow-on,
a *separate, larger* one deferred behind this arc (see the end of this
section): its `trap.s` runs the handler on the interrupted **user** `sp` with no
`sscratch` kernel-stack swap, so it needs a trap-entry redesign before a
cooperative mid-handler park can work at all.

The X1–X4 chunks (below) were staged lowest-risk-first because the x86_64
machinery already existed: ring-3 entry (`tairix_arch_x86_64::userentry`), the
`mem_map` producer path (`mem_map_qemu_x86_64`), a `syscall`/`sysret` stub that
already switches to a kernel stack, an `X86_64Arch: SchedulerArch`, and an
x86_64 `ContextSwitchHal`.

**Binding design findings** (from the x86_64 `syscall` stub,
`kernel/arch/x86_64/src/syscall_entry.rs::syscall_entry_stub`):

- The stub loads the kernel stack from the **per-CPU** `SyscallTls.kernel_rsp0`
  (`gs:0`) and saves the user `%rsp` into the **per-CPU** `user_rsp_save`
  (`gs:8`); the saved user RIP (`%rcx`) and RFLAGS (`%r11`) are **pushed onto
  the kernel stack** (already frame-resident, so they survive a park).
- Unlike aarch64 — where an EL1 trap implicitly reuses the running kthread's
  `SP_EL1`, so each user kthread's syscall lands on its own kernel stack with
  no extra work — x86_64 must **explicitly** point `kernel_rsp0` at the
  **current** user-kthread's own kernel stack on each resume, or two tasks'
  syscall handlers collide on one stack (a correctness *and* isolation defect,
  §4).
- The per-CPU `user_rsp_save` (`gs:8`) is the x86_64 analogue of the aarch64
  `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/`SP_EL0` errata (4c780bc): a task parked **mid-handler**
  by a cooperative `yield`/`wait` (SP2) has its saved user `%rsp` overwritten
  by another task's syscall before it resumes, so the durable save must move
  onto the **per-task kernel-stack frame** (where `%rcx`/`%r11` already live).
  This is a real structural fix — never a limit bump or a "works for one task"
  shortcut (§2.17 / §2.1).

**Security / correctness / performance invariants (all chunks).** Every
syscall stays capability-checked **kernel-side** in `kernel/syscall` (§5.4);
none of this adds authority. Task isolation is enforced by distinct top-level
page tables (a fresh PML4 per space, §4) reactivated through CR3 on resume.
The fixes are structural, fail-closed (§2.9), and carry no `unsafe` without a
`// SAFETY:` block + a test (§2.10). The per-resume CR3 + `kernel_rsp0` reload
is the minimal switch cost the aarch64 sibling already pays; no allocation or
copy is added on the syscall hot path (§2.16).

- **X1 — x86_64 single resumable user-kthread `[x]`.** A single ring-3 task
  is admitted as a resumable user kthread and cooperatively parks/resumes under
  the live scheduler on x86_64. Two primitives, the siblings of the aarch64
  `activate_user_root`: `tairix_arch_x86_64::paging::activate_user_root(root_phys)`
  reloads CR3 (free `mov cr3`, host no-op; the load flushes non-global TLB
  entries so no `invlpg`), and `syscall_entry::set_kernel_rsp0(cpu, top)`
  repoints only the per-CPU `SyscallTls.kernel_rsp0` field (no MSR rewrite, no
  `user_rsp_save` touch) after the same fail-closed `validate_kernel_rsp0`
  stack-pivot check. The arch-neutral `kernel/core::kthread` `pre_resume` hook
  now takes the task's own kernel-stack top (`PreResume = FnMut(u64)`; the
  dispatcher passes `stack.top()`) — closing the gap aarch64 fills implicitly
  via `SP_EL1` (§2.4, not interface creep). The aarch64 hooks ignore the arg.
  Proven by `tests/integration/spawn_el0_resume_qemu_x86_64`: boots the
  production pipeline, builds one isolated ring-3 space via `spawn_image`,
  admits it via `spawn_user_kthread` whose `pre_resume` reloads CR3 +
  `set_kernel_rsp0`, drives `Scheduler::step`, and PASSes once the task yielded
  its full count and exited (dispatch maps `yield`/`exit` to
  `reschedule_current`). The durable user-`%rsp` `gs:8` hazard is **not**
  exercised by one task; its structural fix lands with its two-task exerciser
  in X2. Host tests cover `set_kernel_rsp0`'s validation; docs in
  `docs/src/platform/x86_64.md` ("Resumable ring-3 user kthread").

- **X2 — x86_64 return-state survives a concurrent park + two-task EL0
  timeshare `[x]`.** Two x86_64 tasks timeshare one CPU as resumable user
  kthreads, proven by `tests/integration/spawn_el0_timeshare_qemu_x86_64` (the
  SP2c sibling: two hardware-isolated ring-3 spaces — two PML4s, one shared
  frame pool, §4 — each admitted as a resumable user kthread whose `pre_resume`
  reloads its CR3 + `kernel_rsp0`, driven by the cooperative `step` loop
  mapping each `yield`/`exit` to `reschedule_current`; PASS once both yielded
  their full count and exited). It required **two** independent structural
  fixes, both shipped here (a one-task X1 run exposes neither):
  - **(1) Durable user-`%rsp` save on the per-task kernel frame.**
    `syscall_entry_stub` now `pushq %gs:8`s the just-stashed user `%rsp` onto
    *this task's* kernel-stack frame (beside the frame-resident `%rcx`/`%r11`)
    and restores it with a single `popq %rsp`. The user-`%rsp` slot doubles as
    the System V alignment pad, so the frame size — hence alignment — is
    unchanged (no hot-path cost). `gs:8` is now a transient temp held only
    between the entry `swapgs` and the first kernel-stack push, before any
    cooperative switch can occur, so a task parked mid-handler no longer has
    its saved user `%rsp` clobbered by a *different* task's syscall through the
    shared per-CPU slot. The x86_64 analogue of the aarch64
    `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/`SP_EL0` errata (4c780bc); structural, never a limit
    bump (§2.17).
  - **(2) `swapgs` balance across a cooperative mid-handler park (the blocker,
    not anticipated by the original X2 text).** Fix (1) is necessary but **not
    sufficient**: the two-task vertical (and the *original* pre-(1) stub)
    double-faults identically — a `v=08` #DF with `rsp=0` at
    `syscall_entry_stub`, CR2=-8 — because the per-CPU GS-swap state is left
    unbalanced across a park. The kernel's convention outside the stub's
    swapgs window is current GS = user value, `KERNEL_GS_BASE` = kernel TLS
    (`enter_user` relies on it). When task A's `syscall` runs the entry
    `swapgs` then parks mid-handler via `reschedule_current`, the dispatcher
    enters task B through `enter_user`/`iretq` (no `swapgs`), so B runs ring-3
    with kernel GS still active; B's first `syscall` `swapgs` flips GS the
    wrong way → `movq %gs:0,%rsp` reads address 0 → push faults → #PF on a
    null stack → #DF. X1 never exposes it because the same task always does the
    matching exit `swapgs`. Fix: a HAL cooperative-park hook pair on
    `tairix_arch_api::ContextSwitch` — `enter_cooperative_park` /
    `leave_cooperative_park`, default no-op (aarch64/riscv64 need nothing) —
    that `kernel/core`'s kthread runtime calls in `suspend_thunk_syscall`
    around the suspend switch (the user-kthread mid-handler park path; a
    kernel kthread's `suspend_thunk_body` skips the bracket). x86_64 implements
    them as a `swapgs` back to the between-handler convention immediately before
    the park and back into the stub-window convention immediately after resume;
    both are on the *task's* control flow and pair exactly, and the first
    trampoline→`enter_user` entry never goes through the syscall thunk, so it
    correctly does no swapgs. Structural, fail-closed, no limit bump (§2.17),
    capability checks unchanged (§5.4), per-PML4 isolation intact (§4). No ABI
    change. Stub rustdoc + the `SyscallTls` (transient-`gs:8`) docs updated;
    the host stub-layout test still pins the 16-byte two-word layout. Docs in
    `docs/src/platform/x86_64.md` + `docs/src/architecture/multitasking.md`.

- **X3a — x86_64 PID 1 (`init`) reaches ring 3 (production path) `[x]`.** The
  prerequisite for the x86_64 `spawn` producer: the **production**
  `tairix_kernel::boot` pipeline now spawns PID 1 into ring 3 through the real
  `kernel_main` + `InitSpawn` path (not a test-driven ad-hoc scheduler like
  X1/X2), the cross-port sibling of the aarch64 P6c-3 milestone. Three pieces,
  all wired into `BootInfo`:
  - `x86_64::init_spawn::X86_64InitSpawn` (`with_init`): builds `init`'s ring-3
    image through the audited `spawn_image` and admits it as a resumable user
    kthread (`admit_init`); `pre_resume` reloads CR3 (`activate_user_root`) +
    repoints the entry stack (`set_kernel_rsp0`); `BoxStack` kernel stack
    (software canary — the hardware guard-page form is aarch64-only).
  - `serial_sink::Com1Console` (`with_console`): the COM1 `ConsoleWrite` stream
    backing, so `init`'s fd-1 banner lands (§20); the x86_64 `UartConsole`
    sibling.
  - `boot::try_boot` enables `IA32_EFER.NXE` (production W^X step, §19.2).
  - **Key invariant:** the seam switches CR3 to the fresh space to build the
    image, and the x86_64 page-table walk dereferences tables by their **low
    physical address**, so the space must identity-map all of RAM (not the
    32 MiB `new_identity_first_32mib` window the X1/X2 verticals use). The new
    `paging::AddressSpace::new_identity_first_gib` (shared `new_identity`
    helper) maps 4 GiB, mirroring the boot trampoline (covers RAM + the LAPIC).
    Embedded program rxes now build for x86_64 too (`build.rs` generalised over
    a per-target link recipe). Proven by `tests/integration/spawn_init_qemu_x86_64`
    (PASS on `ProcessSpawned` + an audited `SyscallInvoked`). **No ABI change.**

- **X3b — x86_64 `spawn` concurrent producer `[x]`.** The real x86_64
  `ProcessSpawn` producer — `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/x86_64/spawn_producer.rs`,
  the cross-port sibling of the aarch64 `spawn_producer.rs` — is wired through
  `BootInfo::with_spawn` (in `boot::try_boot`, beside the X3a `with_init` seam)
  with the shared embedded `spawn_layout::PROGRAM_REGISTRY` (the `Shell` `rxe` `build.rs`
  already bakes for x86_64). On `init`'s `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`-gated `spawn` for
  `/System/Commands/elsh.app/Run`, it draws the child's page tables from the kernel's
  live `FrameAllocator` through a boot-cached `kernel/mem` `FrameTableSource`
  (§24.1 — no fixed `.bss` reserve, capacity scales with RAM, fail-closed
  `NoSpace` only on genuine OOM), builds a 4 GiB-identity child PML4 with
  `new_identity_first_gib`, drives the audited `spawn_image` + `admit_process`
  (the child gets only `{CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE, CAP_CONSOLE_READ}`, no ambient
  authority), and admits
  it **Ready** — returning the PID without entering it (a true concurrent spawn).
  **Key decision:** unlike the X3a PID-1 seam (which switches `CR3` to build the
  image), the producer runs under PID 1's own `CR3` — whose
  `new_identity_first_gib` map covers the low 4 GiB identity (existing-table
  physical derefs + the allocator's page-table and image frames) **and** the
  higher-half kernel window (new-table static pointers + the `DirectPhysMap`) —
  so it builds the child's tables **without switching `CR3`**, never moving the
  running parent out from under itself, exactly as the aarch64 producer builds
  through its identity window (§2.2). The child's own `CR3` is reloaded by its
  `pre_resume` hook (CR3 + `set_kernel_rsp0`); its kernel stack is a software-
  canary `BoxStack` (the hardware guard-page fault-form is aarch64-only —
  riscv64/x86_64 `Pending`). Proven by
  `tests/integration/spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` (enrolled in
  `tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs`): PASS on two `ProcessSpawned`
  (PID 1 + the session) and two audited `SyscallInvoked` — the second necessarily
  the session's `exit`, since `init`'s `wait` only completes after the session is
  reaped, proving the session actually *ran* in its own ring-3 space.
  `init`'s `wait`→reap→relaunch supervision cycle is **not** asserted here — it is
  the x86_64 `wait` validation (X4). **No ABI change.**

- **X4 — x86_64 `wait` sibling `[x]`.** The `KernelProcessWait` producer is
  already installed on every production pipeline by `kernel/core`'s `run_phases`
  (so `register_child` on the spawn-admit path and `record_exit` in `exit`
  fire), so X4 added the proving vertical:
  `tests/integration/wait_qemu_x86_64` (enrolled in
  `tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs`), the cross-port sibling of
  `wait_qemu_aarch64`. It boots the production `tairix-kernel` pipeline (GDT
  ring-3 selectors / TSS / `syscall` entry), and on `BootCompleted` builds a
  **parent** and a **child** hardware-isolated ring-3 space (two PML4s, one
  shared frame pool) from the cross-arch `wait_program` fixture (built PIE in
  both roles + converted to `rxe`), installs a `KernelProcessWait<X86_64Arch>`,
  registers the link, and drives the cooperative `step` loop. It admits the
  **parent first**, so the parent's `wait` runs while the child is still
  registered-but-unexited and the producer **parks** it (`Reap::Blocked` →
  `reschedule_current`); the child then runs, exits, and the parent is
  re-dispatched to reap it and copy the reaped code out to its `status` pointer
  — exercising the resume-after-cooperative-park return-state path on the x86_64
  trap, then exiting 0. PASS verified under QEMU. The
  resume-after-park path the X4 note flagged is therefore **proven sound on
  x86_64** (X1/X2's durable user-`%rsp` save + `swapgs` balance cover it). **No
  ABI change.**

- **X4 follow-on — x86_64 `init` supervision cycle (relaunch-`spawn`) `[x]`.**
  `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` now asserts the **full** `wait`→reap→relaunch
  supervision cycle (**3** `ProcessSpawned` / **4** audited syscalls, the
  cross-port equal of the aarch64 sibling): PID 1 `init` spawns the session,
  `wait`s, the session exits, `init`'s `wait` reaps it and returns to ring 3,
  and `init`'s relaunch `spawn` builds a third process — proven green under QEMU.

  **Root cause (was a frame-allocator-vs-kernel-image overlap, not a trap-state
  bug).** The x86_64 `boot::build_memory_map` built the `BootMemoryMap` straight
  from the UEFI map, where `bootmemory::from_uefi` (correctly) classifies
  `EfiLoaderCode`/`EfiLoaderData`/`EfiBootServicesCode`/`Data`/
  `EfiConventionalMemory` as `Usable` — but the loader places *this* kernel
  into that memory, and **nothing reserved the running kernel image** (unlike aarch64
  P6c-1's `[ram_base, __kernel_end)`). By the 2nd (relaunch) `spawn`, the low
  usable RAM consumed by boot + PID 1 + the 1st session pushed the allocator
  cursor across 1 MiB into the kernel image; `spawn`'s `build_process_image`
  zero-fill / page-table writes (through the higher-half direct map) corrupted
  live `.text` (the derail target was `0xffffffff80120000` = physical
  `0x120000`, the kernel image), producing the wild CPL=0 execution.

  **Fix (structural, with regression tests).** `kernel/arch/x86_64/linker.ld`
  now emits a `__kernel_phys_end` physical symbol (end of `.bss`, incl. the bump
  heap), `BootMemoryMap::reserve_range` clips a physical range out of every
  `Usable` region (preserving the allocator's no-overlap invariant; leaving the
  range an implicit reserved gap), and `build_memory_map` reserves
  `[__boot_phys_start, __kernel_phys_end)`. Host-tested in
  `kernel/mem/src/bootinfo.rs` (split/truncate/skip/zero-width + an
  allocator-never-hands-out-a-reserved-frame contract test); proven end to end
  by the strengthened `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` (3/4). Docs:
  `docs/src/platform/x86_64.md` ("Reserving the kernel image out of usable
  RAM").

**Done when (per chunk):** the chunk's QEMU vertical PASSes under `cargo xtask
test --qemu` **and** the whole-project gate (§5) is green; docs + host tests
land in the same change (§7 / §13).

**riscv64 concurrent user mode `[x]`.** The riscv64 spawn/wait
timeshare sibling of the x86_64 X-series, landed lowest-risk-first, one
fully-gated chunk per landing. All of RV1–RV-X4 are done: the riscv64 port
now brings up concurrent, multi-process user mode (resumable user kthreads,
two-task timeshare, runtime `spawn`, and blocking `wait`/reap), reaching
parity with the aarch64 and x86_64 ports.

- **RV1 — `trap.s` per-task kernel stack + frame-resident return state
  `[x]`.** The prerequisite trap-entry redesign. The vector now swaps `sp`
  with `sscratch` on entry (port invariant: `sscratch` = the running user
  task's **trap anchor** while in U-mode, 0 while in S-mode; a nested S-mode
  trap lands `sp == 0` and is recovered onto the interrupted kernel `sp`), so
  the handler never runs on the interrupted **user** `sp` (which a
  cooperative `ContextSwitch::switch` taken mid-handler would wrongly persist).
  The anchor is a 16-byte kernel-only region at the top of the task's
  kernel-stack window carrying the running hart's kernel `tp`, which the
  from-U prologue reloads — after spilling the user's `tp` into the frame —
  before anything reads it: `tp` doubles as this port's per-hart identity
  anchor *and* as the psABI thread pointer U-mode writes freely, so leaving it
  alone would let a task name another hart and steer the kernel onto that
  core's per-CPU state. It also makes the thread pointer per-task, the
  platform contract thread-local storage needs;
  `tests/integration/tp_isolation_qemu_riscv64` is the adversarial witness.
  The vector saves `sepc`/`sstatus`/the interrupted `sp`/the interrupted `tp`
  into a 256-byte `trap::TrapFrame` (GP-register offsets unchanged, so the
  `[u64; …]` syscall view is intact) and reloads them before `sret`, picking
  the U-mode vs S-mode return path from the saved `sstatus.SPP`; the syscall
  path advances the
  **saved** `frame.sepc`. `userentry::enter_user` arms `sscratch` before its
  first `sret`; `init_traps` zeroes it at boot. This is the riscv64 sibling of
  the aarch64 `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/`SP_EL0` return-state errata. Host-proven
  (`trap_layout_tests.rs` parses every `.equ` out of `trap.s` and pins it
  against the `TrapFrame` field or Rust constant it addresses) and
  every line of the redesigned vector is exercised by the existing riscv64
  matrix: U-mode `ecall`s/faults (`mem_map`/`spawn_program`/`abi_sys`/
  `memory_isolation`) drive the from-U swap + U-return path, and S-mode
  timer/IPI traps (`sched_drive`/`ipi_smp`/`timer_preempt`) drive the nested-S
  recovery + S-return path — all green under QEMU. No ABI/C-header impact
  (`TrapFrame` is internal to the arch crate). Doc:
  `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("Per-task kernel stack + frame-resident
  return state").
- **RV-X1 — single resumable user-kthread `[x]`.** The riscv64 sibling of
  x86_64 X1 / aarch64 SP2b. `tairix_arch_riscv64::paging::activate_user_root(
  root_phys)` is the per-task `pre_resume` reactivation primitive: it
  reprograms `satp` (`satp_sv39(root_phys)` + `sfence.vma`) on a hart whose
  paging is already on — a free function over the raw `u64` root (so the hook
  stays `Send`), lighter than `AddressSpace::switch`, with a bare-metal arm and
  an inert host arm presenting one `unsafe` API. The
  `tests/integration/spawn_el0_resume_qemu_riscv64` vertical (reusing the
  arch-neutral `el0_yielder` fixture) reads the timer rate from the firmware
  tree, builds one isolated Sv39 U-mode space via `kernel_core::spawn_image`,
  admits it as a **resumable user kthread** via `spawn_user_kthread` (its
  `pre_resume` hook calls `activate_user_root`; the handed kernel-stack top is
  unused on riscv64 — `sscratch` is armed by `userentry::enter_user` and
  preserved across a park by RV1, with per-task `sscratch` repointing deferred
  to RV-X2), and drives the cooperative `Scheduler::step` loop while the
  dispatch callback maps each `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to `reschedule_current`.
  PASS once the task yielded its full count and exited — the first chunk that
  *exercises* RV1's mid-handler-park safety on a user task. Doc:
  `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("Resumable U-mode user kthread").
- **RV-X2 — two-task EL0 timeshare `[x]`** (SP2c sibling).
  `tests/integration/spawn_el0_timeshare_qemu_riscv64` proves **two**
  hardware-isolated U-mode tasks timeshare one hart as resumable user kthreads
  on `-M virt`: two Sv39 spaces (two `PageTablePool`s + a shared frame pool, §4)
  built from the one `el0_yielder` `rxe` via `kernel_core::spawn_image`, each
  admitted via `spawn_user_kthread`, driven by the cooperative `Scheduler::step`
  loop with the dispatch callback mapping each `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to
  `reschedule_current`. **No new structural code was needed** (the vertical
  only): unlike x86_64's per-CPU `set_kernel_rsp0`, riscv64 `sscratch` is
  per-task hardware state — `userentry::enter_user` arms it on first entry and
  the RV1 trap vector re-arms it from each task's own kernel-stack frame on
  every U-return (`trap.s`: `sscratch = sp + TRAP_FRAME_SIZE`), so each
  `pre_resume` hook only reactivates its `satp` root and ignores the
  kernel-stack-top argument (the predicted per-task `sscratch` repointing is
  unnecessary, as aarch64 SP2c needed nothing over SP2b). Doc:
  `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("Two-task U-mode timeshare (RV-X2)").
- **RV-X3 — `spawn` concurrent producer `[x]`** (SP3b/SP4 sibling).
  `tests/integration/spawn_session_qemu_riscv64` proves a parent U-mode
  task's `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`-gated `spawn` builds a fresh, hardware-isolated
  Sv39 child and admits it **Ready** concurrently on `-M virt`. The
  `spawn_session_program` fixture is one source in two roles (parent
  `spawn`s the session then yields; child/session yields then exits,
  `AGENTS.md` §2.2). The mini-kernel admits the parent as a resumable user
  kthread; its `spawn` `ecall` is routed by the dispatch callback to a
  riscv64 `ProcessSpawn` producer (the cross-port equal of
  `Aarch64ProcessSpawn` / the x86_64 producer) that builds the child its
  own Sv39 space over a separate `PageTablePool` (data frames from the same
  monotonic pool, never aliasing, §4) **through the parent's identity
  window without switching the running parent's `satp`**, admits it Ready
  via `spawn_user_kthread`, and returns its PID — the parent keeps running
  (a true concurrent spawn). The child's own root is installed by its
  `pre_resume` hook (`activate_user_root`) on first resume. PASS once the
  producer built the child and both tasks yielded their full count and
  exited (two `ProcessSpawned`). Doc: `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md`
  ("Runtime `spawn` concurrent producer (RV-X3)").
- **RV-X4 — `wait` `[x]`** (SP6 sibling): the riscv64 cross-port equal of
  `wait_qemu_aarch64` / `_x86_64`. `tests/integration/wait_qemu_riscv64`
  proves a parent U-mode task `wait`s on its spawned child, parks until the
  child exits, reaps it, and reads back its code on `-M virt`. It reuses the
  arch-neutral `wait_program` two-role fixture (child exits with a
  build-pinned code; parent `wait`s + verifies), builds a child + parent as
  isolated Sv39 spaces (the RV-X3 mini-kernel shape) via
  `kernel_core::spawn_image`, installs the shared
  `kernel_core::KernelProcessWait<RiscvArch>` producer, registers the
  parent→child link, and drives the cooperative `step` loop: the child
  `exit`s, the parent's `wait` parks (`reschedule_current`, no busy-spin §2.1)
  then reaps it, the kernel copies the reaped code out to the parent's
  `status` through the retained frozen parent space (`copy_out`), and the
  parent verifies it and exits 0 (PASS, ids 4332-4334). The first riscv64
  exerciser of the resume-after-cooperative-park return-state path on a
  *user* task (RV1's per-task kernel stack + frame-resident return state).
  No ABI change. Doc: `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("`wait`: blocking reap
  of a child (RV-X4)").

**riscv64 production boot path (RV-P series).** The riscv64 spawn/wait
arc above proved the concurrent-user-mode *mechanism* in test mini-kernels;
the RV-P series brings the **production `tairix-kernel` binary** up on
riscv64, mirroring the aarch64 P-stage arc.

- **RV-P1 — production boot to `BootCompleted` `[x]`.** The production
  `tairix-kernel` binary now boots the QEMU `virt` / SiFive board
  (`riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`, linked with the arch port's
  `riscv64-virt.ld`) to `AuditEvent::BootCompleted`. The boot pipeline is
  the new `tairix_kernel::boot_riscv64` (`RiscvBinArch` `KernelArch`
  adapter, `build_boot_memory_map`, `try_boot`, `boot`): it parses the
  OpenSBI-handed device tree for the RAM window + `timebase-frequency`,
  builds the two-region `BootMemoryMap` (`[ram_base, __kernel_end)`
  reserved, the page-aligned remainder usable), and hands a validated
  `kernel_core::BootInfo` to `kernel_core::kernel_main` with `satp = 0`
  (the `virt` board's atomics are well-defined MMU-off, so no Sv39 bring-up
  is needed to reach `BootCompleted`). This pipeline is the **single**
  riscv64 boot orchestration (§2.2): the `tests/integration/riscv64_boot`
  wrapper re-exports it and only adds the test-side firmware-map/DTB
  observers before delegating, so every riscv64 QEMU vertical
  (`kernel_arch_boot_riscv64`, the virtio/framebuffer/input bins) runs the
  production code. Proven by `kernel_arch_boot_riscv64` (`id=4004 kernel
  boot completed` → SiFive PASS). **No ABI change** (the `lib/abi` types,
  syscall table, and C header are untouched). Doc:
  `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("Kernel boot pipeline").
- **RV-P2 — Sv39 MMU enable + trap vector + syscall dispatch `[x]`.** The
  production `boot_riscv64::boot` now runs **paged**:
  `enable_mmu_and_vectors` identity-maps the whole low Sv39 window
  (`[0, 512 GiB)`, 1 GiB leaves over a `.bss` `PageTablePool`), writes
  `satp`, and points `stvec` at the S-mode trap vector via the new
  `trap::install_trap_vector` (the vector-only half factored out of
  `init_traps`, so the boot installs the vector **without** enabling
  asynchronous interrupts — `sie`/`sstatus.SIE` stay clear). The
  production `ecall` dispatch callback `riscv64::dispatch::production_dispatch`
  (the riscv64 sibling of `x86_64::dispatch`/`aarch64::dispatch` over the shared
  `dispatch_core`) is installed before any user thread can run; a pool that
  cannot satisfy the identity map fails closed. Because the map is identity
  (physical == virtual) and full-window, every board address — kernel
  image, DTB, PLIC, MMIO, the device-bring-up DMA carves — keeps its
  address under translation, so every riscv64 vertical runs under the paged
  boot. Proven by `kernel_arch_boot_riscv64` (`mmu_enabled=true
  dispatch_installed=true` → `id=4004` → SiFive PASS) and the
  virtio-blk/net + framebuffer verticals (device bring-up MMU-on). **No ABI
  change.** Doc: `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("Kernel boot pipeline").
- **RV-P3 — user-mode drop + kthread-spawning seam `[x]`.** The riscv64
  `InitSpawn`/`ProcessSpawn` production seams (`riscv64::init_spawn` /
  `riscv64::spawn_producer`, the aarch64 `init_spawn`/`spawn_producer`
  analogue) are installed by `boot_riscv64::try_boot` via
  `BootInfo::with_init`/`with_spawn`, alongside the SBI-console
  `with_console` backing (`RiscvUartConsole` over the new verbatim
  `serial::write_console_bytes`). After `BootCompleted`, `kernel_main`
  drops PID 1 `init` into U-mode (its own Sv39 root, the shared 4 GiB
  `spawn_producer::identity_gigapages()` window plus the direct physical
  map, a window-backed hardware-guarded kernel stack), `init`
  writes its banner through `stream_write` and
  issues the `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`-gated `spawn` for `/System/Commands/elsh.app/Run`; the
  producer builds the session a fresh, hardware-isolated space from the
  allocator-backed `FrameTableSource` (no fixed reserve, §24.1) and admits
  it Ready. The kernel `build.rs` now also builds the embedded `init`/`Shell`
  `rxe` blobs for the riscv64 target. Proven by `spawn_init_qemu_riscv64`
  (`id=4030` PID 1 → the `TAIRiX <version>: …` machine-summary banner → `id=4030`
  Shell → `id=5000 sc=spawn` → SiFive PASS). **No ABI change.** Doc:
  `docs/src/platform/riscv64.md` ("PID 1 into user mode").

### P7 — VideoCore mailbox + framebuffer (metal)

**Landed — the host-provable protocol half.** The BCM2711 mailbox
property-channel client lives in the shared `lib/vcmailbox` crate
(§2.2 — the P7b framebuffer boot console speaks the same protocol; doc:
`docs/src/drivers/display.md`, "Firmware framebuffer discovery"):

- `FramebufferRequest::encode` frames the framebuffer request (set
  physical/virtual size, depth 32, pixel order from the
  `DisplayFormat`, allocate at page alignment, get pitch);
  `decode_framebuffer_response` validates the in-place answer
  fail-closed (header code, per-tag response bits/lengths, exact
  geometry echoes, pitch/size consistency); `bus_to_arm_physical`
  strips the 2-bit VC alias and rejects a zero, unaligned, or
  out-of-aperture buffer. The decoded `FirmwareFramebuffer` yields the
  `ScanoutConfig` (`ScanoutConfig::from_firmware`, plus the bus alias)
  `RpiHvs::open` consumes; the crate also carries the display-size
  query (`query_display_size`) the P7b boot console probes with.
- The doorbell is behind the `MailboxTransport` seam: `MmioMailbox`
  drives the register block over two capability-gated `RegisterWindow`s
  with a budget-bounded poll (`DEFAULT_POLL_BUDGET`), failing closed
  with `Timeout` — never an unbounded spin. A property completion naming
  another buffer (a dead predecessor's, answered late) is drained and
  counted rather than taken for this exchange's reply.
- Host tests cover framing (framebuffer + display-size), every
  fail-closed decode path, the alias↔aperture translation in both
  directions (`bus_to_arm_physical` / `arm_physical_to_bus`), and the
  doorbell transport in `lib/vcmailbox` (against its shared
  `mock::MockFirmware`, exported behind the `mock-firmware` feature),
  plus the wiring fail-closed paths and the full chain in `rpi_hvs`:
  mock firmware → `wiring::open_with_transport` → `ScanoutConfig` →
  `RpiHvs::open` → `present` into the discovered surface.
- **No QEMU vertical, deliberately.** `virt` RAM begins at
  `0x4000_0000` — outside the BCM2711 30-bit VideoCore aperture — so
  the driver's (correct) aperture validation can never pass there, and
  §0.4 forbids a Pi-board QEMU vertical. The emulation artefact is the
  host-side full-chain test; the real scan-out is the metal item below.

**Landed — the metal wiring.**

- `FdtDiscovery` discovers the mailbox node (`brcm,bcm2835-mbox`) and
  emits it into `tairix_abi::hwtree` through the generic Stage 4.HW
  walk (`kernel/arch/aarch64::platform`): the doorbell window as a
  capability-gated MMIO resource (base/length read from the tree, never
  a `const`) plus the one per-device augmentation — a `HwResource::dma`
  request for a one-page property-buffer carve bounded by the 30-bit
  VideoCore aperture (the `lib/fdt` `raspi_like_arm` fixture carries
  the node). The QEMU `virt` tree has no mailbox, so its hardware tree
  simply omits the node (§18.4) and the `-M virt` verticals are
  untouched.
- `drivers/display/rpi_hvs::wiring` is the driver-host bring-up seam:
  `open_discovered` checks `CAP_MMIO_MAP`, maps the discovered doorbell
  + the host's property-buffer carve, translates the carve to a bus
  address (`arm_physical_to_bus`), rings `MmioMailbox`, and delegates
  to `open_with_transport`, which assembles the full `HvsConfig`
  (firmware scan-out + the host's `HvsRegions`: DLIST RAM, control
  window, plane carves) and calls `RpiHvs::open`.

**Accepted on metal.** A real Pi 4B drives the VideoCore mailbox exchange,
maps the firmware framebuffer, and scans the HVS surface out to HDMI; the
operator's photo + UART log is the recorded acceptance artefact.

**Done when:** the mailbox property protocol has host unit tests
(request/response framing, bus↔physical translation, fail-closed on a bad
aperture) — done; `rpi_hvs` consumes a discovered `HvsConfig` — done
(hardware-tree mailbox node + `wiring::open_discovered`); a metal bring-up
scans the firmware framebuffer out to HDMI — done (operator metal
acceptance).

### P7b — Framebuffer boot console: video first, UART fallback

Console output (boot log and every later phase) defaults to the
**attached display**; the UART is the last resort when no video output
exists. Doc: `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`, "Framebuffer boot
console".

**Landed — the code-complete console.**

- `kernel/arch/aarch64::video`: `find_mailbox` discovers the
  `brcm,bcm2835-mbox` doorbell with the shared early-returning
  `fdt::scan_translated` walk; `bring_up` (over the `lib/vcmailbox`
  `MailboxTransport` seam) queries the display's EDID-derived native
  size (`0×0` = no display → UART keeps the console) and allocates a
  32-bit surface at exactly that size — the whole panel, since the
  generated `config.txt` disables the firmware's overscan margins (P9).
  `TextConsole` is a full
  `xterm-256color` terminal: shell output is fed through the one shared
  streaming parser (`tairix_vt::Parser`, §2.2 — no second escape parser,
  depended `default-features = false` so only its allocation-free parser
  view links into the allocator-free QEMU bins), each `Op` mutates the
  retained cell grid, and the dirtied cells are repainted onto the
  scan-out surface once per write — SGR 16/256/truecolour, bold/reverse,
  cursor positioning, erase, scroll region, and explicit scroll. Glyphs
  are the shared `tairix_font` Inconsolata coverage atlas (§2.2, generated
  by `cargo xtask font-atlas`) drawn at its authored 8×16 cell, one atlas
  pixel per screen pixel, so a 1080p panel is a 240×67 grid of crisp cells
  rather than a magnified 120×33 one. Reaching the bottom margin
  scrolls the retained cell grid
  up one line (a real terminal scroll), not a ring wrap; the pixels are
  repainted once per write, never copied per scrolled line — the per-line
  framebuffer copy made a large listing burst monopolise the CPU for
  seconds on metal, starving the buffered serial drain. Program-output
  newline processing is applied inside that retained-grid batch, so one
  `stream_write` remains one repaint and one cache clean rather than being
  fragmented at every line feed; scheduling relies on preemption between
  syscalls, not an output-path yield.
- Bring-up runs in the **pre-MMU** phase of
  `tairix-kernel::boot_aarch64` (caches off ⇒ the property exchange is
  DMA-coherent with no maintenance; the state cell is written by the
  single-threaded boot CPU — no atomic RMW MMU-off). Post-MMU rendering
  serialises on a DAIF-masking `IrqSafeSpinLock` over the port's one masking
  primitive (`irqmask::DaifIrqControl`) and cleans the touched
  scanlines (`dc cvac` + `dsb`) so the firmware scan-out sees them. The
  doorbell base joins the Device-gigapage mask inputs; the boot audit
  line carries `video_console=true/false`.
- `serial::ConsoleWriter` (log sink) and `serial::write_console_bytes`
  (the `stream_write` fd 1/2 backing) render to the screen when
  `video::is_active`, else fall back to the UART; console input stays
  on the UART. Everything fails closed to the UART (§2.9): no mailbox
  node (QEMU `virt` — the UART verticals are unchanged), detached
  display, or any rejected firmware answer.
- Host tests: fixture mailbox discovery (translated `0xFE00_B880`),
  mailboxless-tree fallback, mock-firmware bring-up (native mode,
  detached display, inconsistent answer), the geometry scale policy and
  fail-closed surface validation, and the terminal renderer (glyph
  rows in the default colours, SGR colour interpreted-not-printed,
  256-colour/truecolour, reverse video, control-byte drop, `?` fallback,
  backspace/`\r`, absolute cursor positioning, erase-in-line, upward
  scroll on reaching the bottom, explicit `SU`, dirty bands).

**Accepted on metal.** The boot log renders on the attached HDMI display
on a real Pi 4 (`video_console=true`), and a detached-display boot proves
the UART fallback (`video_console=false`); the operator's photo + UART
logs are the recorded acceptance artefacts.

**Done when:** the boot log renders on the attached display on a real
Pi 4 with the UART fallback proven by the detached-display boot — done
(operator metal acceptance); everything host-provable is landed and
tested — done.

### P7c — Display power: the firmware framebuffer switched off

The boot display's scan-out surface is the firmware's, and so is its output,
so the screensaver's energy saving reaches the panel through the firmware.

What it guarantees:

- **Bound by discovery.** The aarch64 port publishes the boot display node
  with the firmware framebuffer's own binding, `brcm,bcm2708-fb`
  (`tairix_vcmailbox::FIRMWARE_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPATIBLE`), ahead of
  `simple-framebuffer`, only when the surface came from the VideoCore
  firmware. `drivers/display/rpi_fb` binds it at priority 20 over the generic
  framebuffer service's 10, so a board without it still gets a display.
- **The power switch.** `FirmwareDisplay` answers `Display::set_power` with
  the firmware's blank request (tag `0x0004_0002`, `encode_blank_screen` /
  `decode_blank_screen_response`, validated fail-closed like every property
  answer) over the mailbox service (`CAP_MAILBOX`); its pixels take the
  generic `tairix_display::Framebuffer` path under the one service loop
  (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D9).
- **Host-proven** against `mock::MockFirmware`, which models the blank state.

What remains: the metal run — a Pi 4B whose desktop's display-off wait runs
out blanks its HDMI output, and the first input lights it again, with the
operator's photo and UART log as the acceptance artefact.

### P8 — SD-card storage (EMMC2)

**Depends on `PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW** (bind table + `devmgr` + the drvhost
`.rxe` process-spawn path) — all landed: the aarch64 walk emits a
`brcm,bcm2711-emmc2` node (Storage class, translated MMIO window) from a
Pi-shaped tree with no per-device code, and `devmgr` binds the driver
against its `compatible` string (§18.3).

**Landed — the storage path is a discovery-matched bootstrap floor
(§18.6).** Both block drivers now publish a canonical `pub const
BIND_KEYS` (`tairix_drv_storage_emmc2` → compatible
`brcm,bcm2711-emmc2`; `tairix_drv_storage_virtio_blk` → virtio device id
2) — the single §18.3 source the signed manifest's bind table is authored
from. As the storage path that must be up before the signed driver store
is reachable, both are registered in the kernel binary's
`driver_catalog::IN_KERNEL_DRIVERS` floor registry (`build.rs` bakes each
an Ed25519-signed `InKernel` manifest carrying that same `BIND_KEYS`), so
the kernel binds the root block device because a discovered node matched a
driver's bind table — through the one shared `lib/devmatch` policy
`devmgr` uses (§2.2) — never a hand-wired probe (§18.5). Host-proven
(`driver_catalog` storage-node binding + signed-gate admission; the two
crates' bind-table tests). The boot path that *resolves* the discovered
root block node against this floor is landed (`tairix_kernel::root_storage`,
the `4135` `ROOT_STORAGE_AUTOLOAD` bind gate — Chunk B-2 below); bringing
the bound driver up and mounting the volume is the rest of Chunk B-2.

**The block driver.** `drivers/storage/emmc2` (`tairix-drv-storage-emmc2`)
implements `tairix_abi::driver::block::Block` for the BCM2711's SDHCI 3.00
host. Its design and test surface are `drivers/storage/emmc2/README.md` and
`docs/src/drivers/block.md`; the load-bearing facts:

- The state machine is written against the `SdhciHost` seam (registers,
  completion park, timed wait, DMA areas); metal drives it over `IrqSdhci`
  through `wiring::open_discovered`, host tests over `mock::MockSdhci`. No
  QEMU vertical, deliberately — QEMU models no Pi EMMC2 (§0.4).
- **Full speed is UHS-I DDR50 at 1.8 V (50 MB/s).** Clocks are divided from
  the firmware's EMMC2 base clock (`FirmwareClock::Emmc2`), and bring-up
  negotiates down UHS-I → High Speed → Default Speed, verifying each rung
  with a read of block 0. UHS-I needs the `Board`'s `CardSupply`: on the Pi 4
  the `vqmmc`/`vmmc` rails are firmware-expander GPIO lines resolved from the
  device tree (`tairix_arch_aarch64::sd_supply`, `tairix_fdt::supply`) and
  driven over the VideoCore mailbox (`tairix_vcmailbox::set_gpio_state`)
  during the bring-up alone. SDR50 needs tuning on this controller and the
  driver performs none, so DDR50 is the ceiling, as under Linux.
- **ADMA2 moves 256 KiB per command** through staging carved inside the
  node's `/emmc2bus` DMA window and addressed through it; bring-up keeps DMA
  only after a DMA read of block 0 matches the PIO one, else serves the card
  over the data port. Auto-`CMD23` where the SCR offers it; R1 and post-write
  `CMD13` errors fail the transfer; `Sensitive` staging is zeroed.
- The root-unlock bring-up logs the negotiated link (`root-unlock: emmc2
  link`: mode, clock, base clock, signalling, `CMD23`, DMA, fallbacks). The
  debug image also traces every step of it on the UART, each line flushed as
  written (`storage-trace`), so a stalled bring-up shows the step it stopped
  at.

**Metal acceptance.** A Pi 4B brings its card up at UHS-I DDR50, 50 MHz,
1.8 V, with `CMD23` and ADMA2 and no fallback, and mounts `/System` over the
link. Its firmware answers `SET_GPIO_STATE` with a zero per-tag code word, so
the supply switch is judged by the status word alone, as Linux's expander
driver judges it; and it reports no EMMC2 clock, so the host divides from its
capabilities' 100 MHz.

**Done when:** host unit tests cover identification, the speed ladder and its
fallbacks, and both transfer paths against the mock, and the metal boot mounts
from a real card over the negotiated link — both done.

### P9 — Bootable SD image (`tools/mkimage`)

The image builder is landed and the emitted image boots a real Pi 4 into
user mode (operator metal acceptance).

- `tools/mkimage` (`tairix-mkimage`, lib + bin) authors
  `images/tairix-aarch64-rpi.img` in pure Rust (§12 — no
  `parted`/`mkfs` shell-outs): an MBR (three 1 MiB-aligned primaries back
  to back: `0x0C` FAT32 boot @ LBA 2048 and `0x7F` ARXFS root, 64 MiB
  each, around the `0x7E` read-only `/System` sized to its content), with
  every partition laid down by the **real** in-tree drivers
  (`Fat32::format` / `ARXFS::format` — author and consumer share one
  on-disk definition, §2.2), mirroring the
  `tests/integration/{fat32,arxfs}_image` fixture pattern.
- Boot partition: the verified firmware blobs (the `disable-bt` overlay
  planted at its firmware-fixed `overlays/` path), a generated
  `config.txt` (`arm_64bit=1`, `kernel=kernel8.img`, `enable_uart=1`,
  `dtoverlay=disable-bt`, `disable_overscan=1` so the firmware's default
  per-edge overscan margins do not inset the scan-out surface every display
  surface sizes itself from, `init_uart_baud=115200` from the architecture
  port's shared console-rate constant;
  `armstub=armstub8.bin` only when the optional stub is staged), and
  `kernel8.img` — the P1 release ELF flattened by `mkimage`'s fail-closed
  converter (`elfflat`: ELF64/LE/`ET_EXEC`/aarch64 only, `PT_LOAD` layout
  must start *and* enter at `0x8_0000`, overlap/size-bound checks).
- Firmware blobs stay uncommitted third-party inputs (§19.3):
  `tools/mkimage/firmware.lock` pins the upstream HTTPS `source`
  directory plus name + byte length + SHA-256 of `start4.elf` /
  `fixup4.dat` / `bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb` / `overlays/disable-bt.dtbo`
  at upstream release `1.20260521`
  (provenance + licence documented in the manifest); verification fails
  closed on any mismatch. `cargo xtask image` fetches any blob missing
  from its `target/pi-firmware/` cache from the pinned source and gates
  every download on the manifest checksums, so the image build is one
  step; an operator-staged `--firmware` dir is only verified, never
  written. `armstub8.bin` is optional and unpinned — no official binary
  exists and the boot stub parks secondaries itself; it joins the
  manifest when SMP-on-metal needs it.
- Root partition: an encrypted ARXFS volume (no plaintext mode) carrying
  the §16 skeleton (`/System` + its twelve subdirectories incl.
  `Security/{Keys,Policy}`, `/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage`); the §11
  databases/users are the installer's first-boot job. The volume key is
  **passphrase-derived** (§11): the build provisions a per-volume arxfs
  `UnlockDescriptor` (random salt + PBKDF2 cost), derives the key from the
  profile's `passphrase_for` (`INSTALLER_PASSPHRASE` — **blank** — for the
  installer; `DEBUG_PASSPHRASE` — `root` — for the never-shipped debug
  image), provisions the root under it, and plants the plaintext descriptor
  on the FAT boot partition as `root.unlock` (the LUKS-header analogue the
  bootstrap reads before mounting). The bootstrap tries the **blank**
  passphrase silently first, so the installer image unlocks with **no
  prompt** and boots straight into the §11 installer; only a non-blank
  passphrase (debug `root`, or a production operator-chosen one) draws the
  `Root passphrase:` prompt. The derived key is written to the sibling
  `…-rpi.rootkey` file (0600) for host mounting — never inside the image,
  and re-derivable from `root.unlock` + the profile passphrase. A shippable
  user root is unlocked by an operator-chosen passphrase the installer sets,
  never a blank default.
- Entry points: `cargo xtask image --target aarch64-rpi` and the
  delegating `cargo xtask build --target aarch64-rpi` (`--headless`
  accepted; the image content is identical until installable GUI userland
  ships). A staged firmware dir may come from `--firmware` or
  `$TAIRIX_PI_FIRMWARE`; otherwise the pinned blobs are fetched
  automatically. The standalone `tairix-mkimage rpi` CLI mirrors the
  same flags (with `--firmware` required — no network I/O in mkimage).
- Host tests: ELF→flat layout + every refusal, manifest parse/verify
  fail-closed (incl. the committed manifest), boot/root partition
  round-trips re-mounted through the real drivers, the `root.unlock`
  descriptor planted on FAT re-deriving the exact volume key, a
  wrong-passphrase mount refusal (no separate oracle, §5.4), and
  full-image assembly with both partitions mounted from their MBR offsets.
  The MBR table is encoded through the shared scheme-neutral `lib/partition`
  layer — the one definition the kernel root-mount reader parses back, so
  author and reader cannot drift (§2.2); its MBR/GPT encode/parse tests
  live in that crate. Docs: `docs/src/install/raspberry_pi.md`.

**Accepted on metal.** The emitted `.img` boots a real Pi 4 into user mode
per the flashing/first-boot doc; the operator's UART log is the recorded
acceptance artefact (the P7/P8 metal items ride the same boot).

**Done when:** `cargo xtask build --target aarch64-rpi` (and `--headless`)
produces a flashable `.img` — done; `docs/src/install/raspberry_pi.md`
documents flashing + first boot — done; the image boots P6 (user mode) on
real hardware per a recorded checklist — done (operator metal acceptance).

### P10 — USB-HID input + desktop on the Pi

- Bring up the Pi 4 USB host (VL805 PCIe → xHCI for the USB-A ports, and
  the DWC2 OTG) far enough to enumerate a USB-HID keyboard + mouse under
  `drivers/bus/usb` + `drivers/input`, so the WM input router has real
  events.
- Run `userland/gui/{wm,taskbar,session}` on the HVS path: the headless
  build stays first-class (§17.3), and the graphical session is the
  launchable option `userland/session/login` offers when the display +
  input drivers loaded.

**Done — the keyboard comes up entirely in user space (the D5d flip).** The
in-kernel `usb_keyboard::bring_up_keyboard` scaffold is **deleted** (§2.14);
the Pi 4 USB-HID keyboard is now a chain of autoloaded, signed user-space
driver bundles, each its own crate with its device logic co-located as a
`lib` target (§2.22): `drivers/bus/pcie_brcm` trains the link and emits the
VL805 PCI node, `drivers/bus/mailbox/vcmailbox` serves the VideoCore mailbox
(layout shared via `lib/vcmailbox`), `drivers/bus/usb/vl805` reloads the
firmware and emits the `usb,xhci` node, `drivers/bus/usb/xhci` binds it,
brings the controller up over the shared `lib/usb` xHCI protocol and
enumerates, and `drivers/input/usb_hid` serves each HID interface it publishes.
The kernel's bootstrap floor is storage-only (§18.6). **The
historical "Landed" subsections below describe the superseded in-kernel
diagnostic path (the old `drivers/bus/usb` path is now `drivers/bus/usb/xhci`);
they are retained for the PCIe root-cause findings that still apply to
`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm`.** The chain's live acceptance with `usb_hid` (attach
→ keystroke, detach → `usb_hid` unloads while the controller stays up,
re-attach → autoloads again, and cold boot with the keyboard unplugged then
plugged in) is `plans/USB.md` UM. **Metal-pending (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`
D167):** a driver restart that recovers its predecessor's quarantined DMA —
`vcmailbox`'s firmware-revision probe, which rests on the VideoCore answering
property requests in posting order, the VL805's `HCRST` before
`UsbDevice::start`, and GENET's `DMA_DISABLED` wait — each observed, after
killing the driver mid-traffic, as the successor's `DMA_QUARANTINE_RELEASED`
record carrying non-zero `bytes` (every bring-up records one, so the record
alone proves nothing).
**Remaining for P10:** run
`userland/gui/{wm,taskbar,session}` on the HVS path so
`userland/session/login` offers the launchable graphical session when the
display + input drivers are present (the headless build stays first-class,
§17.3). The status detail of record lives in `PLAN.md`.

**Landed — the host-provable protocol layers** (the `emmc2`/`rpi_hvs`
seam shape, §2.2; no QEMU vertical — QEMU models no Pi USB timing,
§0.4):

- `drivers/input/usb_hid` (`tairix-drv-input-usb-hid`): HID
  boot-protocol keyboard + mouse report decode (USB HID 1.11 App. B)
  into `tairix_abi` `InputEvent`s behind the `ReportSource` seam,
  which lives in `lib/abi` (`tairix_abi::driver::input`) because its
  producer is the sibling xHCI driver and drivers depend only on
  `lib/*` (§17.4). Stateful report diffing (one `Key` edge per change;
  HID usage IDs, modifiers `0xE0..=0xE7`, buttons `0x110..` matching
  the virtio pointer vocabulary), rollover handling, fail-closed
  length/forged-source validation (§5.4), an event latch so undersized
  `poll` buffers lose nothing, and a per-`poll` report budget (§2.1).
  21 host tests; docs: `docs/src/drivers/input.md`.
- `drivers/bus/usb` (`tairix-drv-bus-usb`, placeholder replaced): the
  xHCI protocol layers and the HID enumeration engine over the
  `RegisterBlock` register seam (`RegisterWindow` on metal, register-level
  mock in tests) and the `DmaBank` memory seam (the `SlabBank` over
  `lib/abi` `DmaSlab`s on metal, a shared in-memory buffer in tests) — `regs`
  (cap/op/runtime/doorbell vocabulary), `trb` (fail-closed
  `TrbType`/`CompletionCode`, event-field decode, byte conversion),
  `ring` (memory-free `ProducerRing` returning `PushOutcome`s the
  memory owner publishes; borrow-free `EventRingCursor`), `Xhci`
  (§4.2 `open` prologue; `start` programming
  `CONFIG`/`DCBAAP`/`CRCR` + interrupter 0's event ring over `RTSOFF`
  and running the controller; `ack_event`; RW1C-safe `begin_port_reset`),
  and `device::UsbDevice` — the single-device enumeration engine
  (64-byte-aligned layout of all device-shared structures; Enable
  Slot / Address Device / Configure Endpoint command flow; control
  transfers: fail-closed `GET_DESCRIPTOR(device)`,
  `SET_CONFIGURATION(1)`, `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)`; a primed interrupt-IN
  ring) implementing `ReportSource` with end-to-end claim validation
  (slot/endpoint/code/address/residual, §5.4) and retire/re-arm
  across the Link-TRB wrap. 38 host tests against the register-level
  mock plus an in-memory ring model sharing one buffer, including a
  `BootKeyboard` decoding key events over the mock controller and the
  fail-closed paths (forged residual, stalled class request, empty
  port, double enumeration, bad DMA regions); docs:
  `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`.

**Landed — ECAM configuration access** (the cross-arch path the VL805
sits behind): `drivers/bus/pci` gained `mechanism_ecam`, an
`EcamConfigSpace` `ConfigSpace` impl over a capability-mapped
`tairix_abi::RegisterWindow` (PCI Express Base 3.0 §7.2.2 flat
offset, `ConfigAddress::ecam_offset`), fail-closed to the all-ones
"no device" sentinel on an out-of-window or malformed access (§5.4).
The mechanism-agnostic enumeration / capability / BAR core is reused
unchanged (§2.2); host-proven by a flat-ECAM VL805 fixture
(`1106:3483` xHCI behind a root-port bridge) driving enumeration +
MSI-X capability decode, plus offset/round-trip/sentinel unit tests.
Docs: `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`, the crate README.

**Landed — PCIe host-bridge discovery** (the aarch64 `FdtDiscovery`
walk): the `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` node is emitted generically (a `Bus`
node whose controller/config — ECAM-access — `reg` window translates
through the bus `ranges` exactly like every other device), with one
per-device augmentation: the **inbound-DMA aperture** the bridge grants
devices behind it, read from the node's `dma-ranges` by the new
`fdt::dma_ranges_aperture` (the 3-cell child PCI address stepped over,
the 2-cell parent CPU base + size decoded, fail-closed). It is emitted
as `HwResource::dma(top, len)` — `top` the *exclusive* upper bound of
the reachable CPU-physical window (`0xC000_0000`, the low 3 GiB of
SDRAM, on the Pi 4), `len` its extent — matching the mailbox "carve
below `base`" convention; the bases are discovered, never a board
constant (§18.5). Host-proven by the platform discovery tests (a
`/scb`-nested PCIe bridge: translated `reg` window `0xfd50_0000`/`0x9310`
+ aperture `0xC000_0000`; the no-`dma-ranges` fail-closed case) and the
`fdt::dma_ranges_aperture` unit tests (real Pi value, multi-entry span,
absent/partial/out-of-range-cell refusals). **No `lib/abi` change** (so
no C-header regen). Docs: `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` ("Platform
discovery").

**Landed — the VL805 `wiring::open_discovered`** (host-provable): the
generic-PCI seam `tairix_abi::driver::pci::PciBus` (a supertrait of
`Bus`) carries `map_bar_window` + `enable_bus_master` — the smaller
surface a non-virtio, DMA-driving controller needs (no MSI-X). `Pci<C>`
implements it by forwarding to the inherent BAR resolver and a shared
`enable_bus_master` that `route_msix` also calls (§2.2);
`mechanism_one`/`mechanism_ecam` now return `impl VirtioPciBus + MsixBus
+ PciBus`. `drivers/bus/usb::wiring::open_discovered(host, bus,
dma_aperture_top)` consumes a `&dyn PciBus` (so usb never names the pci
crate, §17.4): it checks `CAP_MMIO_MAP`, enumerates for the USB-class
function (`0x0C03`), carves the device-shared DMA region from the host
DMA facility and verifies it lies wholly below the discovered
inbound-DMA aperture `top` (fail-closed `OutOfRange`, §5.4), enables bus
mastering, maps BAR0, and brings the controller up via `Xhci::open` +
`UsbDevice::start`. **No `#[repr(C)]`/syscall change** — a new trait, so
no C-header regen. Host-proven: pci tests (PciBus coercion,
`enable_bus_master` command bits, BAR0 map, absent-BAR refusal over the
VL805 ECAM fixture) + usb `wiring_tests` (the cap/mapper/DMA-host
fail-closed paths, no-USB-function `NotFound`, DMA-above-aperture
`OutOfRange`, alloc-failure propagation, and the all-valid path enabling
mastering and reaching the controller hand-off — the inert mock window
faults, the metal boundary). Docs: `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`,
`docs/src/abi/driver_traits.md`, the crate README.

**Landed — the BCM2711 PCIe root-complex bring-up** (host-provable): the
VL805 sits behind the BCM2711 root complex, which ships with its link
**down** and whose configuration space is *not* flat ECAM. Two pieces
close that gap. `drivers/bus/pci` gained `mechanism_brcm` +
`BrcmConfigSpace`, the BCM2711 *windowed* (index/data) configuration
access (`EXT_CFG_INDEX` 0x9000 / `EXT_CFG_DATA` 0x8000): the root-bus
header is read directly, a downstream function's `(bus<<20)|(devfn<<12)`
block address is written to the index register, then the dword is reached
through the 4 KiB data window — the only BCM2711-specific knowledge, the
enumeration/BAR/cap core unchanged (§2.2). The new
`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm` crate (`BrcmPcieRc`) performs the link bring-up
over the BCM2711 root-complex registers: reset + assert `PERST#`, power the SerDes
(clear `IDDQ`), program `MISC_CTRL`, the inbound `RC_BAR2` viewport from
the discovered `dma-ranges` (size via `encode_ibar_size`), disable
`RC_BAR1`/`RC_BAR3`, confirm the root-port role (fail closed otherwise),
advertise ASPM + the PCI-PCI bridge class, program the outbound `ranges`
MMIO window, deassert `PERST#`, then poll `MISC_PCIE_STATUS` for link-up
bounded by `DEFAULT_LINK_POLLS` (100 ms, fail closed). Written against a
`RegisterBlock` (`RegisterWindow` on metal, register mock in tests) + `Delay`
seam; `wiring::open_discovered` maps the controller window under
`CAP_MMIO_MAP`. **No `lib/abi`/C-header change.** Host-proven: pci
`mech_brcm` tests (root-bus direct read, downstream index/data,
out-of-range/no-device, beyond-window fail-closed) + pcie_brcm tests (full
reset→SerDes→window→link sequence, bridge-reset-before-MISC ordering, ibar
encoding, fail-closed link-down + not-root-port, the wiring cap/mapper/
inert-window paths). Docs: `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`, the crate README.

**Landed — the in-kernel `DriverHost` serves both MMIO and DMA**
(host-provable): the in-kernel host the VL805 chain needs is complete.
`drvhost::HostConfig` gained an `mmio_mapper: Option<&dyn MmioMapper>`
seam and `DriverHost::mmio_mapper()` is implemented on the loaded-driver
view (alongside the existing `virtio_host()` DMA seam), so a loaded bus
driver maps its own register windows through the capability-gated
`KernelMmioMapper` *and* carves its DMA region through the per-driver
`KernelVirtioHost` — both fail closed at the kernel `map_mmio`/`alloc_dma`
gates (§5.4). `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/driver_host.rs`'s
`run_with_driver_host` assembles that host on a single boot frame
(`KernelMmioMapper` + `KernelVirtioFactory`) and lends it to a `body`
closure; every window and DMA pool is reclaimed when the closure returns
(§4). **No `lib/abi`/C-header change** (the seam is a trait-method
addition). Host-proven: drvhost `mmio_mapper_{default_none,some}_yields_*`
accessor tests + the `driver_host` `host_serves_both_mmio_and_dma_*` /
`driver_without_mmio_cap_is_refused_fail_closed` composition tests.

**Landed — outbound-window discovery into the hardware tree**
(host-provable): the `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` node now carries *both* address
windows the VL805 wiring needs, read from the device tree. Alongside the
inbound `dma-ranges` aperture (an `HwResource::dma`), the aarch64
`FdtDiscovery` now decodes the bridge's outbound `ranges` memory window
(`fdt::outbound_mmio_window`: the first memory-space entry's `phys.hi`
space code, the 64-bit PCIe base from `phys.mid`/`phys.lo`, the CPU base
and size from the parent cells) and emits it as a new
`HwResource::bus_window(cpu_base, size, pcie_base)`. That required
extending the hwtree ABI with `HwResourceKind::BusWindow` and a third
`xlate` (far-side/translated base) field on `HwResource` (WIRE_LEN
24→32; abi-v1 is unfrozen, §2.13) — a `BusWindow` is the general model
for a CPU↔bus address-translation window, distinct from a plain `Mmio`
register window so the controller `reg` is never conflated. C-header
regenerated. Host-proven: `fdt::outbound_*` decoder tests (memory
decode, I/O-space skip, absent/partial/out-of-range fail-closed), the
`platform::emits_the_pcie_bridge_with_its_outbound_window` emission test,
and the `HwResource::bus_window` round-trip in `lib/abi`.

**Landed — the USB-keyboard composition engine** (host-provable). The
inbound `dma-ranges` aperture is now emitted as
`HwResource::dma_translated(top, len, inbound_pcie_base)`
(`fdt::dma_ranges_aperture` captures the child PCI base in the resource's
translation field — no wire change, the `xlate` field already existed),
so `PcieWindows` is *fully* tree-derived. The whole chain is composed in
`kernel/tairix-kernel::usb_keyboard` — the image-assembly seam
(`Layer::Tooling`) is the one crate that may name the four driver crates
across strata (§17.4 / §8), so the composition lives there, like
`virtio_boot`; the engine is architecture-neutral (it consumes only the
`lib/abi` driver seams + the discovered `HwNode`) and un-gated, so it
compiles and host-tests on the CI host:

- `pcie_bringup_from_node(&HwNode) -> PcieBringup` reads the three
  resources (controller `Mmio`, inbound `Dma`, outbound `BusWindow`) off
  the discovered `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` node, fail-closed per missing
  resource (§2.9) — relocated under Increment C-2 into the PCIe device's
  own crate (`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm::wiring`, §2.2/§2.21), where it now
  also backs the autonomous `bring_up_from_node` floor entry; the
  composition re-exports and consumes it;
- `ChainHost` is a `DriverHost` view lending the bus driver the kernel's
  capability-gated MMIO mapper + per-driver DMA host (every map/alloc
  re-checked kernel-side, §5.4);
- `bring_up_keyboard(host, &PcieBringup, &dyn Delay)` runs the full chain
  — `pcie_brcm::wiring::open_discovered` (link train) → `mechanism_brcm`
  → `usb::wiring::open_discovered` → `UsbDevice::bring_up`
  (scans root-hub ports 1..=max and attaches every connected device;
  an empty controller comes up serving nothing) → `BootKeyboard`;
- `QueueConsoleSink` feeds the produced bytes into the video console's
  `ConsoleInput` queue (`console_input`/`VIDEO_KEYBOARD`), short-pushing
  without spin (§2.1).

Host-proven: the `usb_keyboard` composition tests (the sink delivers /
drops-overflow-without-spin, `ChainHost` reports caps/mapper/dma, the
chain fails closed without `CAP_MMIO_MAP`, and the chain reaches the
BCM2711 root-complex bring-up over a mapped window and fails closed
`DeviceFault` on the inert mock — the metal boundary), plus the usb
bring-up root-port-scan tests; the discovered-node parse tests
(window assembly + each fail-closed missing resource + a non-zero inbound
PCIe base) moved with `pcie_bringup_from_node` into the `pcie_brcm` crate
under Increment C-2 (§2.2/§2.21).

**Landed — the aarch64 boot-path invocation** (host-proven up to the
metal boundary; the live bring-up is a metal-acceptance item, §0.4). The
production aarch64 boot path now starts the chain as an **in-kernel
keyboard service kthread**:

- `kernel/arch/aarch64::platform::pcie_bringup` resolves the
  `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` node's three windows (controller `reg`, inbound
  `dma-ranges` aperture, outbound `ranges`) with a single early-returning
  `scan_translated` walk, **pre-MMU-safe** (it reads only the matched
  node's own properties, like the console/GIC/video walks); a tree with no
  such node yields `None` (the `virt` shape, §18.4).
- `boot_aarch64` runs it pre-MMU, folds the controller-register and
  outbound-window gigapages into the identity **Device** mask
  (`identity_device_mask`) so both are identity-mapped Device memory before
  the MMU comes on, then stashes the `Copy` discovery for the spawn seam
  (`keyboard_service::record_discovery`) **after** the MMU is enabled — the
  seam's `SpinLock` `compare_exchange` is an atomic RMW that is
  UNPREDICTABLE on MMU-off memory (P6c-2), so the store is deferred past
  translation-enable while the windows themselves are read pre-MMU.
- `kernel/tairix-kernel::keyboard_service` supplies the concrete
  `DriverHost` halves: an `IdentityMmioMapper` (capability-gated; admits a
  window only inside the controller block or outbound window, returns a
  `phys == virt` `RegisterWindow` — no live page-table edit, since the boot
  path already mapped those gigapages, §5.4/§2.16) and a `FrameDmaHost`
  (capability-gated; carves the 16 KiB xHCI region with
  `FrameAllocator::alloc_order`, translates the frame to its device-visible
  address through the inbound viewport, and rejects anything outside the
  aperture, §5.4). A `GenericTimerDelay` over `kernel_arch::busy_delay_us`
  (`CNTPCT_EL0`) drives the link-training settle waits.
- The PID 1 spawn seam (`init_spawn`) calls
  `keyboard_service::bring_up_keyboard_into_tree(ctx)` **before** `admit_init`
  drives the dispatch loop: it runs `bring_up_keyboard` once on the boot CPU,
  emits the enumerated HID node into the boot tree (design B / B3), and hands
  the live keyboard to `keyboard_service::spawn_pump`, whose kthread is
  admitted onto the boot CPU's run queue and runs alongside PID 1 looping
  `usb_hid::pump_once` into the input-focus arbiter
  (`ArbiterConsoleSink`), yielding between polls (§2.1). A bring-up failure
  ends the service fail-closed (the video login parks with no keyboard,
  §2.9); with no discovered bridge (the `virt` shape) nothing is started.
- **Metal diagnostics (logging).** Because the bring-up is metal-only and
  was previously silent on failure, it logs one-shot, allocation-free
  events to the serial sink so a silent keyboard is diagnosable from a UART
  capture alone (§2.16/§19.4 — never on the poll loop): `boot_aarch64`
  logs the discovered `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` chipset windows (id `4100`),
  `spawn_pump` logs the report-pump kthread admitted/skipped (id `4103`), and
  `bring_up_keyboard` logs each stage and the failing stage+`DriverError`
  (id `4101`), a one-shot post-link PCIe configuration scan listing every
  responding function (`function_count_hex` + per-function
  bdf/vendor/device/class, id `4104`), plus the enumerated device's
  vid/pid/slot (id `4102`). See `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`.
- **Downstream config forwarding + single-device config gate (fixed).**
  The VL805 on bus 1 was invisible because the BCM2711 ships the root
  port's type-1 bridge bus-number register (`PCI_PRIMARY_BUS`, config
  offset `0x18`, exposed at the controller register block's offset 0) at 0,
  forwarding no configuration to its secondary bus. `BrcmPcieRc::bring_up`
  programs it (`program_bridge_bus_numbers`, primary 0 / secondary
  `RC_SECONDARY_BUS` 1) when it presents the RC as a PCI-PCI bridge.
  Enabling forwarding then exposed a boot **wedge**: the bus walk is a flat
  256-bus scan, and a config read to a non-existent forwarded target (any
  device but `01:00.0`, or any bus beyond the directly-attached one) emits
  a TLP nothing answers — `CFG_READ_UR_MODE` only master-aborts requests
  the RC itself refuses, so a *forwarded* TLP's completion timeout becomes a
  CPU external abort that hangs the boot CPU (capture stops right after
  `4101 link trained`). Fixed in the windowed accessor: the BCM2711 root
  port is a single-device link, so `mechanism_brcm(window, secondary_bus)`
  forwards a transaction **only** to `device 0` on the secondary bus and
  resolves every other downstream target to the `0xFFFF_FFFF` sentinel
  without touching the controller (it never forwards to an absent target); the
  bridge subordinate is kept equal to the secondary (no on-board switch,
  §2.3). Host-proven by `bring_up_names_the_downstream_bus_so_config_is_forwarded`
  and `mech_brcm::phantom_downstream_targets_are_no_device_without_an_index_write`.
  The metal `4104` capture then listed **two** functions (the bridge plus
  the VL805 `1106:3483` class `0c03`), confirming discovery is complete.
- **xHCI DMA-aperture bound — CPU-vs-PCIe address space (fixed).** With the
  VL805 discovered, the `4101` xHCI controller bring-up failed
  `err=out_of_range`: the device-shared DMA carve was bounded in the wrong
  address space. `DmaSlab::phys()` is a *device-visible* (PCIe-space)
  address, but `keyboard_service::FrameDmaHost` and
  `tairix_drv_bus_usb::wiring::open_discovered` compared it against the
  *CPU-physical* inbound-aperture top (`0x2_0000_0000`). The Pi 4 inbound
  viewport maps PCIe `[0x4_0000_0000, 0x6_0000_0000)` onto RAM
  `[0, 0x2_0000_0000)`, so every frame's device address (≈ `0x4_xxxx`)
  exceeded the CPU top and the carve was refused before any hardware was
  touched. Fixed by bounding each side in its own space: `FrameDmaHost` now
  checks the frame's CPU-physical span against the CPU window top and
  translates afterwards, and `bring_up_keyboard` passes `open_discovered`
  the device-visible top (`inbound_pcie_base + inbound_size`, checked). The
  redundant, address-space-ambiguous `PcieBringup.dma_aperture_top` field
  (derivable from `windows`) was removed (§2.2/§2.14). Host-proven by
  `keyboard_service::dma_host_admits_a_low_frame_through_a_high_pcie_viewport`.
- **xHCI register BAR mapping — bridge-aware translation + unassigned-BAR
  assignment (fixed).** `keyboard_service::IdentityMmioMapper` is
  bridge-aware: it applies the outbound `ranges` translation
  (`outbound_cpu_base + (bus − outbound_pcie_base)`) to reach the
  identity-mapped CPU address (the generic PCI walk only knows bus addresses;
  resolving them is the host bridge's job), the controller
  regs block stays CPU-physical/identity and is resolved first, and a request
  only partially overlapping the numerically-overlapping Pi 4 regs island
  (`0xfd50_0000`) is refused fail-closed (§5.4). `IdentityMmioMapper::new`
  takes `outbound_pcie_base`; `with_diag(&SERIAL_SINK)` logs each map decision
  one-shot (`EventId(4105)`, off the poll path) so a metal capture shows the
  refused base. That capture localised the real cause: the VL805's BAR0
  address bits read **zero** — the BAR is sized/typed but *unassigned*
  (firmware programs BARs, but resetting and re-enumerating the root complex
  leaves the downstream function unassigned), so mapping it targets address 0.
  Assigning resources from the bridge's outbound window is the PCI core's job;
  added `PciBus::assign_bar(bdf, bar_index, window_base,
  window_size)` (implemented on `Pci<C>`): it probes BAR size/type and, when
  the address bits are zero, writes the lowest size-aligned PCIe-bus address
  in the window (both dwords for a 64-bit BAR, control bits preserved); an
  already-based BAR is left untouched (no-op under QEMU/firmware-assigned).
  `usb::wiring::open_discovered` takes the outbound window and calls
  `assign_bar` before `map_bar_window`. Host-proven by
  `pci::assign_bar_places_an_unassigned_64bit_bar_in_the_window` (+ idempotent
  / oversize / I/O / absent cases), `usb::open_discovered_enables_mastering_
  and_reaches_the_controller` (asserts the window reaches `assign_bar`), and
  `keyboard_service::mapper_translates_a_bar_through_the_outbound_viewport`.
- **VL805 firmware fallback (current).** `open_controller` follows the safe order: configure the PCIe bridge and assign/map BAR0 first, read the
  VL805 firmware version at config `0x50`, skip any reload when it is already
  non-zero, and issue exactly one `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` only when the bounded
  version wait stays `0`. The mailbox uses the shared `lib/vcmailbox`
  protocol over the boot-discovered VideoCore doorbell and a cache-maintained
  static property buffer; `4108` records the fallback outcome and `4113` the
  diagnostic response value. Host-proven by
  `open_controller_reloads_firmware_when_version_stays_zero`,
  `firmware_reload_is_skipped_when_version_is_already_loaded`, and the
  `lib/vcmailbox` encode/decode/coherency tests. Live keyboard enumeration is
  the remaining on-metal acceptance item (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB, §0.4).
- **BAR still `dead_dead` after the reload = bridge memory window never
  forwarded; fixed by programming it during root-complex bring-up.** A
  later metal capture showed the reorder + readiness poll necessary but not
  sufficient: `4108 Reloaded` and `4109 … ready_hex=0` with the capability
  header *still* uniform `dead_dead` after the full budget. The cause was
  not the reload but a missing bring-up step: a PCI-PCI bridge forwards a
  *memory* transaction downstream only when the address lies inside its
  **Memory Base/Limit** window (type-1 config offset `0x20`), and the
  BCM2711 ships it empty (base `0`, limit `0`). The bring-up had programmed
  the bridge *bus-number* register (so *config* reads reached the VL805 —
  the `4104` scan saw `1106:3483`) and the controller's CPU→PCIe outbound
  *translation* (`MEM_WIN0`), but never the bridge memory window, so the
  root port master-aborted every CPU access to the VL805's BAR. The fix is
  `BrcmPcieRc::program_bridge_mem_window` (run right after the bus-number
  programming): it sets the bridge Memory Base/Limit to cover the discovered
  outbound PCIe range (`[outbound_pcie_base, +outbound_size)`), the range
  BARs are assigned within, as a full PCI enumerator does (which the
  windowed `mech_brcm` accessor does not perform). The register encodes only
  address bits `[31:20]` and the non-prefetchable window decodes below 4 GiB,
  so a window reaching the 4 GiB line fails closed (§5.4); the BCM2711's
  outbound base `0xc000_0000` is well below it. Host-proven:
  `bring_up_opens_the_bridge_memory_window_so_bar_reads_are_forwarded`
  asserts the window covers `0xc000_0000..0x1_0000_0000`. Metal acceptance
  item: a healthy capture should now read a real `CAPLENGTH` at `4107`/`4109
  ready_hex=1`; a `4109 ready_hex=0` with `dead_dead` after this fix would
  localise the fault past the bridge window to the reload step itself
  (mailbox sequence / `dev_addr` / board firmware). QEMU models no Pi PCIe
  (§0.4).
- **`4110` configuration read-back — measuring which write stuck after the
  bridge-window fix.** A capture *after* the bridge-window fix still showed
  `4108 Reloaded`, `4109 ready_hex=0` and `4107` uniform `dead_dead`. At that
  point the whole controller/bridge programming chain is present in code
  (bridge bus numbers, bridge Memory Base/Limit, CPU→PCIe outbound
  translation, VL805 BAR assignment, VL805 command-register memory-space +
  bus-master), yet the mapped BAR aborts while *config* reads still succeed.
  Rather than guess again (§15.7), `open_controller` now reads each
  programmed register *back* (one-shot `EventId(4110)`, after BAR assign +
  command enable, before `Xhci::open`): bridge `0x18`/`0x20`/`0x04` and VL805
  `0x04`/`0x10`/`0x14`. Served by a new read-only `PciBus::read_config(bdf,
  offset)` (lib/abi, implemented on `Pci<C>`, reaches both the bus-0 bridge
  and the VL805 via `mech_brcm`); fail-closed (a faulting read renders the
  all-ones sentinel, never propagated, §2.9), one-shot (never on the poll
  path, §2.16/§19.4). Host-proven: `read_config_returns_the_dword_at_the_byte_offset`
  (abi), `config_readback_dumps_each_register_once` +
  `config_readback_renders_a_sentinel_for_a_faulting_read` (usb_keyboard).
  QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB (§0.4).
- **Enable the root-port bridge Command register *after* the link is up
  (done; landed on metal but not the fix).** `BrcmPcieRc::program_bridge_command` sets Memory Space +
  Bus Master in the root port's Command register (config `0x04`, the standard
  PCI-PCI bridge enable). The `4110` capture showed it read back `0x0000`
  while the adjacent bus-number (`0x18`) and Memory Base/Limit (`0x20`) writes
  — same direct bus-0 path — stuck, so the offset is right and the difference
  is *timing*: the integrated RC latches Memory Space Enable only against a
  **live link**, and the earlier bring-up wrote it during the config phase
  with `PERST#` still asserted. A working boot chain enables the root port
  only after the link trains. Fix: `bring_up` now calls `program_bridge_command`
  **last**, after `train_link` + the fail-closed `link_up()` confirmation, so
  MEM-space/bus-master latch against the trained link. This is the unifying
  explanation for the triple symptom — `VideoCore` reaches the VL805 over the
  same configured bus to load firmware ("VideoCore expects from us a
  configured PCI bus"), so an un-latched bridge command master-aborts *both*
  our BAR reads *and* the firmware-load writes, leaving `dead_dead`,
  `fw_version=0`, and `response=0` together. Host-proven:
  `bring_up_enables_memory_space_and_bus_master_on_the_bridge` (asserts the
  command write follows the final `PERST#`-deassert). **Metal outcome:** the
  later capture confirmed `bridge_command_status_hex` now reads back `0x6`
  (the latch fix works) — but the VL805 BAR is *still* `dead_dead` and
  `vl805_fw_version_hex` *still* `0` both before and after the reload, so the
  bridge command was a real defect but not the firmware-load fix. QEMU models
  no Pi PCIe/USB (§0.4).
- **Gate readiness on the VL805 firmware version, not the aborting BAR
  (done; the gate is the correct signal — firmware-load is the metal-only
  residual).** `open_controller` gates readiness on `wait_for_firmware_loaded`:
  it polls the VL805 **XHCI MCU firmware version** (config `0x50`, the
  *working* vendor firmware-version register) for a non-zero
  build id, bounded by `FW_LOADED_BUDGET_US` (~2 s wall time) — strictly more
  correct than the old gate, which polled the master-aborting BAR. The
  `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` reload is demoted to fire **only** if the version stays
  `0` (a redundant reload of an already-(re)loading VL805 can kill it,
  raspberrypi/firmware #1380), then the BAR caps wait (`4109`) runs once the
  firmware is loaded. Logged one-shot as `EventId(4118)`
  (`polls_hex`/`fw_version_hex`/`ready_hex`). Host-proven:
  `open_controller_reloads_the_firmware_as_a_fallback_when_version_stays_zero`
  (the reload fires + two `4118` records when `0x50` stays `0`) and
  `open_controller_skips_the_firmware_reload_when_mapping_fails`.
  **Decisive metal + known-good datapoint (this confirms the gate and
  closes the host-side investigation):** the `4118` capture shows
  `fw_version_hex=0` through the full ~2 s budget, a no-op `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET`,
  and a second `4118` still `0`. On the *same* board a known-good capture
  reads `0x50 = 0x000138c0` (a real firmware build id
  `VideoCore` writes on load), `10.l = 0xc000000c` (BAR0 based at `0xc000_0000`,
  **prefetchable**), `04.w = 0x0546` (mem-space + bus-master). So `0x50` *is*
  the genuine firmware-version register on this board, and our `0` /
  non-prefetchable `BAR0=0xc0000004` / `dead_dead` are all consistent symptoms
  of a genuinely firmware-less VL805 — i.e. the `4118` gate observes exactly the
  right thing and is **not** a red herring. Every host-verifiable PCI element
  (outbound window decode, bridge command/bus-numbers/mem-window, BAR address,
  and the `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` message: tag `0x30058`, dev_addr `0x10_0000`) is
  proven correct. The sole residual is that our
  `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` is *honoured* (tag response bit set) yet a no-op
  (firmware version never advances), where the same flow elsewhere loads the
  blob — a `VideoCore`/board-firmware-state matter that produces no further
  signal on the (now-proven-correct) PCI side and cannot be reproduced or
  verified without the hardware (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB, §0.4).
- **Inbound-window lead (raspberrypi/firmware #1617, then pftf/RPi4 #1495)
  — IN PROGRESS (metal capture pending).** #1617 suggested `VideoCore`
  loads the VL805 firmware over PCIe **through an inbound DMA window**. The
  bring-up read-back of that inbound window was byte-identical to the
  known-good **runtime** window `IB MEM 0x0..0x1ffffffff -> 0x4_0000_0000`.
  But #1495 shows the
  `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` load *assumes* a particular `RC_BAR2` state instead of
  reading it back, and the blob is **not** loaded at runtime, so
  matching its runtime window does not prove the window matches what
  `VideoCore` assumes at the load moment. The standing change pursues this
  (host-proven; decisive datapoint is metal):
  - `BrcmPcieRc::entry_inbound_window` captures `RC_BAR2`/`RC_BAR1`/`RC_BAR3`
    **as `start4.elf` left them**, before bring-up touches them, logged
    one-shot as `EventId(4120)` (`log_entry_inbound_window`), so a metal run
    sees the firmware's own inbound window. Tests:
    `entry_inbound_window_reports_the_state_before_bring_up_programs_it` /
    `..._logs_one_4120_record`. (The matching post-program window read-backs —
    a former `EventId(4119)`/`4111` and `BrcmPcieRc::inbound_window_readback`/
    `outbound_window_readback` — were removed once bring-up was metal-confirmed:
    reading those MISC registers after the link trains stalls for seconds on
    real BCM2711 silicon while the in-kernel bring-up holds the CPU, and they
    add no functional value with the link up — `AGENTS.md` §2.14/§2.16.)
  - `bring_up` now **preserves a firmware-configured `RC_BAR2`** (a non-zero
    size field) rather than overwriting it, honouring VideoCore's assumed
    state; it only programs the inbound window from discovery when the firmware
    left it unconfigured. Test:
    `bring_up_preserves_a_firmware_configured_inbound_window`.
  - The mailbox `Timeout` is now localised: `vcmailbox::ExchangeStats`
    (`MmioMailbox::last_exchange_stats`) records the timeout stage (post-room
    vs response), posted word, poll counts and last status, logged as
    `EventId(4121)` (`keyboard_service::log_mailbox_exchange`). Test:
    `mmio_exchange_stats_localise_the_timeout_stage`.
  - A **runtime mailbox liveness probe** (`GET_FIRMWARE_REVISION` tag `0x1` —
    a state-free read) is issued over the same channel immediately **before**
    the `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` reload; it now lives with its one consumer as
    `vl805::probe_firmware_revision`, the in-kernel keyboard-service scaffold
    that used to drive it having been deleted at B5. It separates a broken
    post-MMU mailbox path from `VideoCore` dropping only the xHCI tag (a
    successful probe with a non-zero revision, then a reload timeout). Tests:
    `firmware_revision_query_lays_out_the_get_tag`,
    `firmware_revision_round_trips_through_a_healthy_firmware`,
    `firmware_revision_decode_fails_closed`,
    `probe_firmware_revision_reads_the_revision_word`.
  - **Mailbox response-length handling audited and confirmed correct**
    (against the VideoCore property protocol as documented in the
    raspberrypi.stackexchange.com #133040 answer). The classic bug — telling
    VideoCore a `0`-byte value buffer so it cannot reply — does not occur:
    `push_tag` sizes every tag's value-buffer length word to
    `max(request, response)` words (`ALLOCATE`=8 B, `GET_PITCH` /
    `GET_FIRMWARE_REVISION` / `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET`=4 B), and `find_tag` reads
    the per-tag response data bounded by that buffer. Because we never
    under-provision, the protocol's "response length may exceed buffer length,
    real data = `min(buffer, response)`" truncation case cannot arise for our
    fixed-layout tags, so `find_tag` fails such a reply closed rather than
    clamping (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). Pinned by `encode_lays_out_header_tags_and_end_marker`,
    `xhci_reset_lays_out_the_dev_addr_tag`,
    `firmware_revision_query_lays_out_the_get_tag` and
    `decode_rejects_short_and_oversized_tag_responses`. The metal
    `4122 probe_outcome=ok` (revision read over the same buffer) with
    `4121 timeout_stage=response` is therefore VideoCore dropping the xHCI tag
    at the firmware handoff, **not** a response-length/buffer-sizing fault.
  - **Firmware-version register no longer gates the bring-up — probe the
    authoritative BAR capability block instead (latest experiment;
    `AGENTS.md` §2.9 / §15.7).** The config-space `0x50` register is a VL805
    *vendor* convenience, not the xHCI controller's readiness signal; the
    controller's own capability block (`CAPLENGTH`/`HCIVERSION` on the BAR,
    xHCI 1.2 §5.3) is. The metal capture (`4118`/`4121`/`4122`) shows `0x50`
    staying `0` and `VideoCore` dropping the working mailbox's
    `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` tag, yet on a board whose boot firmware left the
    controller's MCU firmware resident the capability block can be live
    regardless. So `open_controller` now treats the firmware-version wait +
    one-shot `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` reload as **best-effort/diagnostic**: it
    records the decision as `EventId(4123)` (`log_firmware_gate`,
    `firmware_loaded_hex`) and **always proceeds** to `wait_for_caps_ready`
    (`4109`) + `Xhci::open` — the real fail-closed gate — rather than aborting
    at `DeviceFault` before the BAR was ever probed (the previous behaviour
    never logged `4109`/`4107`/`4114`/`4106` on the failing metal path). Tests:
    `open_controller_probes_the_bar_when_reload_does_not_make_version_loaded`,
    `open_controller_probes_the_bar_when_firmware_reload_fails`,
    `open_controller_proceeds_after_reload_makes_version_loaded`. **Decisive
    metal datapoint:** the now-reachable `4109 ready_hex=1` (a live
    `CAPLENGTH`/`HCIVERSION` at `4107`) with the keyboard enumerating (`4102`)
    proves the controller's firmware is resident and the in-tree path is
    complete regardless of `0x50`; `4109 ready_hex=0` with `dead_dead` caps
    confirms the controller genuinely never decodes, pinning the residual on
    the boot-firmware handoff below. Metal-only (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB,
    §0.4).
  - **`4124` post-reload PCIe error snapshot — done: no master abort, VL805
    reachable.** The read-only `log_bridge_error_status` (`4124`) logged
    immediately after the reload reads the root-port command/status (`0x04`),
    the root-port **Secondary Status** (config `0x1C`, bits `[31:16]`), and
    the VL805 command/status (`0x04`). The metal capture read
    `bridge_secondary_status=0` (no Received Master/Target Abort) with the
    bridge + VL805 commands enabled (`0x...0006`/`0x...0146`), so
    `VideoCore`'s firmware-load is **not** master-aborting on the bridge — the
    downstream VL805 path is reachable. This **disproves** the bus-reach
    hypothesis (the former "option B": realigning `pcie_brcm` inbound
    `dma-ranges`/`RC_BAR2` with the BCM2711 PCIe bring-up sequence is no longer indicated —
    the BAR capability block also reads live at `4107`/`4109`, confirming the
    PCI path works end-to-end). The dropped `4121 timeout_stage=response`
    therefore points at `VideoCore`'s loader, not the bus. Host-proven by the
    `4124` assertion in
    `open_controller_probes_the_bar_when_reload_does_not_make_version_loaded`.
  - **Reload response-wait too short — done: the reload now completes.** The
    reload formerly busy-polled `DEFAULT_POLL_BUDGET` (1,000,000) iterations,
    which the metal capture showed completing in only ≈400 ms (the
    `4122`→`4121` gap) — well under the **full second** the vendor bring-up allows the same
    property call. The reload mailbox now uses a dedicated `FIRMWARE_RELOAD_POLL_BUDGET`
    (`10 × DEFAULT_POLL_BUDGET`, ≈4 s of metal wall time, above that 1 s),
    and `reload()` measures the reload's real `CNTPCT_EL0` wall time (shared
    pure `keyboard_service::counter_elapsed_us`) into the `4121`
    `wait_elapsed_us_hex` field (with `poll_budget_hex`). The follow-up metal
    capture **confirmed** the fix: `4121 timeout_stage=none`, `last_status=1`,
    `wait_elapsed_us≈0x16266` (≈90 ms), and `4108` now logs *reloaded*
    (success) rather than the old timeout — the prior give-up was premature.
    Host-proven by `counter_elapsed_us_converts_a_tick_span_at_the_counter_rate`
    and `counter_elapsed_us_fails_closed_on_a_zero_or_reordered_sample`.
  - **Inbound SCB window unsized — `MISC_CTRL_SCB0_SIZE`: done, metal-confirmed.**
    Comparing our `pcie_brcm` `bring_up` against the known-working BCM2711
    PCIe bring-up sequence found the one
    concrete divergence: both program `MISC_CTRL.SCB0_SIZE =
    ilog2(round_pow2(region)) - 15` (bits `[31:27]`, mask `0xf800_0000`) to
    size the inbound SCB (PCIe→system-memory) decode window to the DMA region,
    **unconditionally** on the BCM2711, while our `bring_up` left `SCB0_SIZE`
    at its reset default. An undersized inbound decoder silently drops a
    PCIe→memory DMA past that small window while config reads, enumeration, BAR
    assignment and the outbound path all succeed (the `4124` snapshot showed
    **no** master-abort), so `VideoCore`'s `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` firmware-load
    completed yet never landed the blob. `pcie_brcm` now programs `SCB0_SIZE`
    (`encode_scb_size`, fail-closed `0` outside 64 KiB‥64 GiB; `0x11` for the
    Pi's 4 GiB viewport) and the inbound read-back (`4119`/`4120`) carries a
    `misc_ctrl_hex` field. **The metal capture confirmed the fix decisively:**
    `4118 fw_version=0x138c0 ready=1`, `4108` *reloaded*, `4123
    firmware_loaded=1`, and `Xhci::open` brought the controller fully online
    (`4101 … enumerating root hub`, `4106 max_ports=5`). The VL805 firmware
    handoff is solved — the long firmware-never-loads investigation is closed.
    Host-proven by `encode_scb_size_sizes_the_inbound_scb_window_to_the_region`,
    `bring_up_trains_the_link_and_programs_the_windows` (SCB0 assertion) and
    `inbound_window_readback_reports_the_programmed_viewport`.
  - **Root-hub port power (`PORTSC.PP`): done, metal-confirmed.**
    With the controller online, the residual moved to root-hub enumeration:
    `4101 no usb device enumerated on the root hub err=device_fault`. The scan
    (now `UsbDevice::bring_up`'s root-port walk) read each port's Current Connect
    Status **once**, immediately after Run, with no Port Power asserted and no
    connect debounce — but the Host Controller Reset in `Xhci::open` clears
    every `PORTSC`, and the VL805 is port-power-controlled (`HCCPARAMS1`
    PPC = 1), so a powered-off port reports disconnected regardless of what is
    attached (xHCI 1.2 §4.19.1.1). The scan now asserts `PORTSC.PP`
    (`Xhci::set_port_power`, masking the write-1-to-clear bits) on every
    reported port, then debounce-polls `1..=max_ports` (bounded by the engine
    budget, fail-closed `NotFound` on a genuinely empty hub) for the first port
    to report a device; `EventId(4125)` logs every root port's post-power
    `PORTSC` (raw + decoded `ccs`/`pp`/`ped`/`speed`) on the failure path.
    **The metal capture confirmed the fix:** `4125` now reads port 1
    `ccs=1 pp=1 ped=1 speed=3` (a connected, enabled, high-speed device) with
    the other four ports powered but empty — so power asserts correctly and the
    device is present. Host-proven by `drivers/bus/usb`
    `set_port_power_asserts_pp_and_rejects_a_bad_port`,
    `bring_up_powers_every_root_port` and
    `bring_up_connects_a_port_only_after_power`.
  - **Enumeration fault localisation (`EnumStage` / `4126`): done, the
    localiser that pinned the next root cause.** With a device on port 1 the
    `device_fault` was *inside* the root attach; the single coarse
    `DriverError::DeviceFault` could not say where. The driver records a
    breadcrumb — `enum_stage()` (an `EnumStage` discriminant set as each step
    runs) and `last_completion_code()` (the raw xHCI completion code of the last
    event that step observed, reset to `0` = none/timeout at the start of each
    command/control transfer, set undecoded via `Trb::completion_code_raw`) —
    logged one-shot on the failure path as `EventId(4126)`
    (`stage_hex` + `completion_hex`) before the `4125` port dump. Host-proven by
    `drivers/bus/usb` `root_attach_records_the_configured_stage_on_success`
    and `root_attach_fails_closed_on_a_non_stall_class_fault`.
  - **Non-coherent DMA cache maintenance — done; necessary but not
    sufficient (`AGENTS.md` §4 / §15.7).** The `4126` metal capture read
    `stage_hex=2` (Enable Slot)
    `completion_hex=0`: the *first* command issued to the online controller
    never produced a Command Completion event, although the capability block
    reads live over MMIO and a device is attached — the controller is not
    consuming the command ring at all, the signature of a **cache coherency**
    gap. The BCM2711 PCIe root complex is **not** I/O-coherent (the very reason
    the VideoCore mailbox and the HVS framebuffer already clean/invalidate on
    this platform), yet the xHCI device-shared DMA region is plain cacheable,
    identity-mapped RAM and the engine's `DmaSlab`-backed read/write did **no**
    maintenance: the command-ring TRB the CPU wrote stayed in a dirty cache
    line the controller never saw (stale memory → no command → no completion),
    and symmetrically the CPU would read a stale event ring. The fix gives
    `DmaSlab` an optional `SlabCoherencyFn` (`with_coherency`) and a
    `sync_range(offset, len)` that cleans **and** invalidates the touched range
    to the point of coherency; the USB engine's DMA-bank read/write invalidates
    **before** every read and cleans **after** every write, and
    `keyboard_service::FrameDmaHost` wires the aarch64
    `clean_invalidate_dcache_range` (`dc civac` + `dsb`) into every minted slab
    (a slab without a shim — coherent interconnect / host test — skips it).
    Host-proven by
    `dma_slab_sync_range_brackets_only_in_bounds_ranges_through_the_hook`
    (lib/virtio) and
    `slab_bank_brackets_writes_and_reads_with_cache_maintenance`
    (lib/usb). A rebuilt image carrying the maintenance still captured
    `4126 stage_hex=2 completion_hex=0`, so it was necessary but not the whole
    cause — the controller had a second reason not to consume the command ring
    (the scratchpad lever below).
  - **Scratchpad buffers — done; `AGENTS.md` §4 / §15.7.** The
    residual `stage=2 completion=0` was the missing xHCI **scratchpad buffers**.
    `HCSPARAMS2` Max Scratchpad Buffers names page-sized buffers software must
    reserve and point `DCBAA[0]` at before the controller can run any command
    (xHCI §4.20); the VL805 datasheet reports `HCSPARAMS2 = 0xFC00_0031` — **31**
    buffers (`SPR = 1`) — but the driver read neither `HCSPARAMS2` nor `PAGESIZE`
    and allocated none, so `DCBAA[0]` stayed zero, the controller had nowhere to
    save state, and it executed no command despite accepting Run/Stop and
    reporting a live capability block. `Xhci::open` now reads `HCSPARAMS2`/
    `PAGESIZE` (`max_scratchpad_buffers()` / `page_size()`, surfaced as `4106`
    `max_scratchpad_hex`); `device::Layout` reserves a page-aligned scratchpad
    pointer array plus that many page-aligned buffer pages (fail-closed if the
    bank cannot supply the chunk or a scratchpad-needing controller reports no
    page size / an unaligned base); `UsbDevice::start` fills the array with
    each buffer's device-visible base and points `DCBAA[0]` at it; and the
    engine's shared chunk is grown from the `tairix_usb::SlabBank` sized
    exactly to that reported geometry (the 31 × 4 KiB pages plus the
    rings/contexts), with each device's region a further chunk grown on
    attach and released on detach. Host-proven by `drivers/bus/usb`
    `start_reserves_scratchpad_and_programs_dcbaa0` (a mock that, like the VL805,
    withholds every command completion until `DCBAA[0]` is programmed —
    enumeration then runs end to end),
    `start_stalls_without_scratchpad_on_a_controller_that_needs_it`, and the
    `hcsparams2_decodes_the_vl805_scratchpad_count` /
    `pagesize_decodes_the_lowest_supported_page` decode tests. **Decisive metal
    datapoint:** `4106 max_scratchpad_hex=0x1f` confirms the count is read, and
    the keyboard enumerating (`4102`) — or `4126` advancing past `stage_hex=2` —
    confirms the missing scratchpad was the blocker; a still-stuck `stage_hex=2
    completion_hex=0` means the command ring is still not consumed for a further
    reason. Metal-only beyond the host tests (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB, §0.4).
    **Metal-confirmed:** the capture read `4106 max_scratchpad_hex=0x1f` and
    `4126` advanced to `stage_hex=8 completion_hex=6` — the command ring runs and
    the device addresses, reads its descriptors, and configures.
  - **`SET_PROTOCOL(boot)` STALL tolerated — done; `AGENTS.md`
    §2.9 / §15.7.** With the scratchpad reserved, enumeration reached the
    last step and stopped at `4126 stage_hex=8 completion_hex=6`: the HID
    `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)` class request (`EnumStage::SetProtocol`) answered
    **STALL** (code `6`). `SET_PROTOCOL` is mandatory only for boot-subclass
    devices (HID 1.11 §7.2.6); a device that does not implement it STALLs,
    and a STALL on the default control endpoint is a *protocol* stall that
    auto-clears on the next SETUP (USB 2.0 §8.5.3.4), so the device stays
    usable in its default protocol (a non-implementing device ignores a
    stalled `SET_PROTOCOL`). The driver treated any non-Success control
    completion as `device_fault`, aborting an otherwise enumerable keyboard.
    The enumeration now issues `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)` through `control_optional`,
    which absorbs a STALL (raw code preserved in `last_completion`), primes
    the interrupt-IN ring, and reaches `EnumStage::Configured`; every other
    completion still fails closed. It is the last EP0 transfer and EP0 is not
    reused, so a halted control endpoint after the STALL is immaterial.
    Host-proven by `drivers/bus/usb` `root_attach_tolerates_a_stalled_set_protocol`
    and `root_attach_fails_closed_on_a_non_stall_class_fault`.
    **Metal-confirmed:** the capture logs `4102 vendor=2109 product=3431` —
    enumeration runs end to end, so the tolerated STALL was the last
    *enumeration* blocker. What enumerates, however, is the onboard hub, not
    the keyboard (the hub-topology lever below).
  - **Hub topology.** The `4102` device is `2109:3431` — the Pi 4B's
    **onboard VIA Labs USB hub** between the VL805 root hub and the four USB-A
    ports. The keyboard is plugged into a USB-A port, so it enumerates
    *downstream* of that hub, not on a root-hub port; the bring-up enumerated
    and configured the hub itself but a hub emits no HID reports, so login
    still sees no keystrokes. The enumerated device's `bDeviceClass` is `0x09`
    (`DeviceDescriptor::is_hub`). When the device is a hub the bring-up reads
    its `bNbrPorts` (class `GET_DESCRIPTOR(hub)`), asserts Port Power on every
    downstream port (class `SET_FEATURE(PORT_POWER)`), waits
    `HUB_POWER_ON_GOOD_US` (~100 ms), and logs each downstream port's class
    `GET_STATUS` as `EventId(4127)` (`UsbDevice::hub_num_ports` /
    `power_hub_port` / `hub_port_status` over the hub's already-addressed EP0).
    The `4127` record with `connected_hex=1` pins which downstream port the
    keyboard is on and its `speed_hex`.
  - **EP0 halted by `SET_PROTOCOL` on the hub — done; `AGENTS.md` §15.7.**
    The metal capture read `4101 reading the hub descriptor failed
    err=device_fault`: the class `GET_DESCRIPTOR(hub)` faulted though the
    device/config-descriptor reads on the same EP0 had succeeded. Root cause:
    the enumeration issued the HID `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)` to *every* device,
    including the hub; a hub is not a HID device so it STALLs that request, and
    an xHCI STALL **halts** the control endpoint (xHCI §4.10.2.4) until reset.
    `control_optional` tolerated the STALL on the (now-broken) assumption that
    it is the last EP0 transfer of enumeration — but a hub reuses EP0 for the
    hub-descriptor read, which then ran on a halted endpoint. Fixed by issuing
    `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)` **only** to a HID interface (`InterfaceInfo::is_hid`,
    `bInterfaceClass == 0x03`); a hub (interface class `0x09`) never receives
    it, so its EP0 stays usable. A keyboard plugged directly into the root hub
    is unaffected (its HID interface still gets it, still last). The `4127`
    hub-descriptor-read failure log now also carries `completion_hex` (raw xHCI
    completion code). Host-proven by `drivers/bus/usb`
    `root_attach_recognises_a_hub_via_the_device_class`,
    `enumerating_a_hub_leaves_ep0_usable_for_the_hub_descriptor` (the mock
    STALLs the hub's `SET_PROTOCOL` and models the EP0 halt — fails before the
    gate, passes after), `hub_discovery_finds_the_downstream_device`,
    `hub_port_reads_disconnected_until_powered`, and
    `a_forged_hub_descriptor_fails_the_attach_closed`.
  - **Per-port `GET_STATUS` faults — current lever; `AGENTS.md` §15.7.** With
    the EP0 fix the hub-descriptor read succeeds (metal `4127 num_ports=4`) and
    Port Power is asserted on every downstream port, but the capture then read
    every port's `wstatus_hex=0xffff` (the all-ones sentinel) with
    `completion_hex=0` — each per-port class `GET_STATUS` (USB 2.0 §11.24.2.7)
    faulted while `GET_DESCRIPTOR(hub)` and `SET_FEATURE(PORT_POWER)` on the
    same EP0 succeeded. The sentinel-decoded `connected=1 speed=2` are
    artifacts, not real reads, so the downstream port holding the keyboard is
    still unknown.
  - **`completion_hex=0` was a diagnostic gap, now fixed (done).** The four
    `4127` records are spaced at the same ~250 ms serial cadence as the
    non-faulting `4125` lines, so each `GET_STATUS` failed *fast* (not after
    the million-iteration budget) — an event almost certainly arrived.
    `UsbDevice::control`/`command` recorded `last_completion` only **after**
    `await_event_for` returned `Ok`, but `await_event_for` returns `Err` before
    that on an unexpected TRB address *or* a completion code outside the
    modelled set {1,2,3,4,5,6,13} (its fail-closed `completion_code()` decode),
    leaving the `0` "no event" sentinel — so a real-but-rejected code was
    mislabelled as a timeout. `await_event_for` now records
    `last_completion = completion_code_raw()` the instant it observes any
    command/transfer event (before the address match and the decode), so
    `completion_hex` is truthful: a genuine `0` now means no event at all, a
    non-zero value names what the hub answered (including a reserved /
    controller-specific code). The now-redundant post-`await` assignments in
    `control`/`command` were dropped (§2.2/§2.14). Host-proven by
    `faulting_hub_port_status_records_the_completion_code` (STALL `6`) and the
    new `faulting_hub_port_status_records_an_undecodable_completion_code` (the
    unmodelled xHCI code `7`: fails closed on the decode yet
    `last_completion_code()` now retains `7` — read `0` before the fix).
  - **Latest capture + reject localisation — current lever; `AGENTS.md`
    §15.7.** With `completion_hex` truthful the metal capture named it: ports
    1–2 read `completion_hex=0x0d` (xHCI ShortPacket, the IN data stage), ports
    3–4 `completion_hex=0`, **all** still failing closed (`wstatus=0xffff`).
    Every *other* EP0 control transfer (device/config/hub descriptors,
    `SET_ADDRESS`/`SET_CONFIGURATION`, `SET_FEATURE(PORT_POWER)`) succeeds on
    the same EP0, so only the class `GET_STATUS` fails; `control` already
    tolerates a ShortPacket data stage, so the `0x0d` is the data stage and the
    **status-stage** event then fails the wait — and the ~250 ms logging
    cadence shows the wait rejects *fast*, so a real event arrives that it
    rejects, not a timeout. The remaining gap was that `await_event_for`
    discarded *why* it rejected and *what* it saw; it now records a
    `last_reject` reason (`1` unexpected TRB type, `2` TRB-address mismatch, `3`
    undecodable completion code, `4` budget timeout) and the rejected event's
    raw `last_event_type` (reset per transfer, exposed via
    `UsbDevice::last_reject_reason`/`last_event_type`; behaviour unchanged —
    same fail-closed `Err`, §2.9), surfaced as `evtype_hex`/`reject_hex` on the
    `4127` record. Host-proven by `Trb::trb_type_raw` and
    `faulting_hub_port_status_records_an_unexpected_event_type` (a `GET_STATUS`
    answered by a `NoOp`-type event: the wait fails closed,
    `last_reject_reason()=1`, `last_event_type()=8`, `last_completion_code()` a
    truthful `0`).
  - **Root cause of the `GET_STATUS` faults: the hub's interrupt endpoint was
    armed — fixed.** The metal capture came back `reject_hex=2`
    (TRB-address mismatch) with `evtype_hex=0x20` (a real Transfer Event) on
    ports 1–2, and ports 3–4 with no event (`completion=0`/`reject=0` = the
    EP0 ring had wedged from the earlier faults). Root cause:
    the enumeration configured, primed, and doorbelled the **interrupt-IN
    endpoint for every enumerated device, including the hub**. A hub's
    interrupt endpoint is its status-change pipe; once armed and doorbelled the
    hub delivers asynchronous status-change reports, and those interrupt
    Transfer Events interleave with the subsequent EP0 hub-class `GET_STATUS`
    control transfers — their TRB pointer is not in the control wait's watch
    list, so `await_event_for` rejects them (`reject=2`), and the faulted
    transfer leaves its TRBs in flight, wedging the EP0 ring for the remaining
    ports. Fixed by configuring/priming/doorbelling the interrupt-IN endpoint
    (and issuing `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)`) **only for a HID interface**
    (`InterfaceInfo::is_hid`): a hub keeps only its control endpoint, which is
    all the downstream-port `GET_STATUS` polling needs, so no async event is
    ever generated to corrupt it. A keyboard plugged directly into the root hub
    is unaffected (its HID interface still arms its report ring). Host-proven by
    `drivers/bus/usb` `enumerating_a_hub_does_not_arm_its_interrupt_endpoint`.
    The metal capture then read clean: `4127` reported real
    `connected_hex`/`speed_hex` per port (the keyboard on a downstream port,
    full speed).
  - **Downstream addressing — done (second xHCI slot, Route String + TT).**
    `UsbDevice::enumerate_downstream_hid(down_port, speed)` addresses the
    keyboard hanging off the hub on a **second** slot: the hub stays addressed
    on its slot (`Layout` reserves a second `output_ctx2`/`ep0_ring2`, and
    `control`/`address_device`/`next_report` follow the active slot via
    `ep0_ring_off`/`output_ctx_off`), and the downstream slot's context carries
    the **Route String** (the hub's downstream port, §8.9) plus — for a
    full/low-speed device behind the high-speed hub — the **TT** Hub Slot ID +
    Port Number (§6.2.2). `slot_ctx_dwords` takes a `SlotCtxBase` (speed,
    root_port, route, TT); the post-Address sequence is the shared
    `finish_enumeration` (identical to a root-port device). A latent bug fixed
    in passing: `control`'s data-stage publish wrote the *first* slot's ring
    offset, harmless for a root device but fatal for the second slot. The kernel
    `usb_keyboard::address_downstream_keyboard` finds the connected port, resets
    it (`SET_FEATURE(PORT_RESET)`, kernel-owned recovery delay), confirms it
    enabled, and addresses it, logging the keyboard under `EventId(4128)`.
    Host-proven by `enumerate_downstream_hid_addresses_a_full_speed_keyboard_through_the_hub`
    (full speed → TT validated), `..._omits_the_tt_for_a_high_speed_device`, and
    `..._before_a_hub_is_addressed_fails_closed`. **Metal: `4128` confirmed** —
    a re-flash logged the keyboard (`3434:0e21`, slot 2, hub port 4, full
    speed). Metal-only beyond the host tests (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB, §0.4).
  - **Mark the parent hub as a hub — done (downstream keystrokes flow).**
    With `4128` confirmed on metal, pressing keys still produced nothing: the
    keyboard was addressed but never delivered a report. The hub had been
    enumerated like any device, leaving the **Hub** bit clear in its slot
    context, so the VL805 never scheduled the full-speed keyboard's split
    transactions (Address Device still succeeds, hence `4128` passed). Fix:
    `enumerate_downstream_hid` now calls `configure_hub_slot` before addressing
    the device — it reads the hub descriptor (`read_hub_topology`, validated by
    `HubDescriptor::decode`: `bNbrPorts` + `wHubCharacteristics` TT Think
    Time), copies the hub's live output slot
    context (`read_ctx`), sets the **Hub** bit + **Number of Ports** + **TT
    Think Time** (single-TT, MTT clear), and issues an `A0`-only Configure
    Endpoint over the hub's slot (xHCI §6.2.2). The mock now requires the Hub
    bit on that command and delivers no downstream interrupt report until it is
    set, so `addressing_a_downstream_keyboard_marks_the_parent_hub_as_a_hub`
    and the existing full-speed drain test fail before the fix and pass after.
    **Metal:** a re-flash still typed nothing at the prompt — the keyboard is
    addressed and the hub marked, but no report reaches the console; the next
    bullet instruments the poll loop to localise that.
  - **Keyboard poll-loop diagnostics — done (`4129`/`4130`/`4131`).** With the
    keyboard addressed (`4128`) and the hub marked, typing still produced
    nothing. After bring-up the keyboard service polls forever
    (`pump_once` → decode → `ArbiterConsoleSink`), and that loop **discarded
    its result** (`let _ = pump_once(...)`), so a UART capture could not tell
    whether reports arrive, whether `next_report` faults, or whether the loop
    runs at all. `keyboard_service`'s loop now folds each poll result into
    `usb_keyboard::KeyboardPumpDiagnostics`, which emits three **bounded** audit
    events (§2.16 / §19.4): a one-shot `4129` the first time a report drains
    (keystrokes flow), an on-change `4130` carrying the `DriverError` name when
    `pump_once` faults (capped at 16), and a capped `4131` heartbeat (every 1024
    polls, ≤ 32 total) carrying cumulative `polls`/`events`/`errors`. The metal
    reading splits the failure: `4129` present ⇒ path works; recurring
    `4130 err=device_fault` ⇒ `next_report` rejects the controller's
    interrupt-IN events; `4131` polls climbing with `events=0 errors=0` ⇒ the
    loop is alive but the controller never completes the interrupt endpoint.
    Host-proven by `pump_diagnostics_logs_the_first_report_only_once`,
    `..._logs_a_pump_error_on_change_and_caps_it`, and
    `..._emits_a_bounded_heartbeat`. **Metal:** the re-flash read the `4131`
    branch — the heartbeat climbed (`polls 0x400`→`0x8000`) with
    `events=0 errors=0`, no `4129`/`4130`: the loop polled fine, `next_report`
    never faulted, but the controller serviced the interrupt endpoint never;
    the next bullet fixes that. Docs: `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`.
  - **Interrupt-endpoint Max ESIT Payload — done (the no-report fix).** The
    `4131 events=0` reading localised the silent keyboard to "addressed but the
    periodic endpoint is serviced never". Root cause: the interrupt-IN endpoint
    context (`ep_ctx_dwords`) left **Max ESIT Payload** zero (§6.2.3.8 dword 4
    bits 16:31). The xHCI periodic scheduler reserves no bus bandwidth for a
    periodic endpoint whose Max ESIT Payload is zero (§4.14.2), so the
    controller scheduled the full-speed keyboard's split transactions through
    the hub's TT *never* — Address Device and Configure Endpoint both succeed
    (hence `4128`), but no report ever flows. The fix programs Max ESIT
    Payload = the max packet size for any periodic (non-zero-Interval)
    endpoint; a control endpoint leaves the field reserved-zero. The mock now
    delivers no interrupt report while the payload is zero, so
    `the_downstream_interrupt_endpoint_carries_a_nonzero_max_esit_payload` and
    every existing report-drain test fail before the fix and pass after.
    **Metal:** the re-flash did **not** change the symptom — `4131` still
    climbed with `events=0`, no `4129`/`4130` — so a non-zero Max ESIT Payload
    is necessary but was not the (only) cause; the next bullet found it. Docs:
    `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`, `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`.
  - **Interrupt endpoint read from the descriptor — done (the no-report fix
    that held).** With the hub marked and a non-zero Max ESIT Payload the metal
    keyboard was *still* silent (`4131 events=0`). The remaining wrong
    assumption was the endpoint itself: the driver hard-coded the interrupt-IN
    endpoint as endpoint 1 (DCI 3), a fixed interval, and an 8-byte packet, and
    never read the keyboard's endpoint descriptor. A keyboard whose
    interrupt-IN endpoint is not endpoint 1 then has its Configure Endpoint,
    doorbell, and `next_report` all aimed at the wrong DCI, so the controller
    schedules the real endpoint never — Address Device + Configure Endpoint
    succeed (hence `4128`), but no report flows. `InterfaceInfo::decode_all`
    now walks past each default-alternate interface to its first interrupt-IN
    endpoint and captures its DCI (`2·endpoint_number + 1`), `wMaxPacketSize`, and
    `bInterval`; `finish_enumeration` configures/doorbells/drains that DCI
    (stored as `UsbDevice::int_dci`) and `interrupt_interval` derives the
    endpoint-context Interval from `bInterval` + speed (xHCI Table 6-12) rather
    than a fixed exponent; a HID interface with no interrupt-IN endpoint fails
    closed (`BadMagic`). The mock derives the configured DCI from the Configure
    Endpoint add flags and posts interrupt events with it, so
    `downstream_keyboard_is_serviced_on_its_descriptor_reported_endpoint` (a
    keyboard whose interrupt endpoint is endpoint 2 → DCI 5) fails before the
    fix and passes after. **Metal: confirmed.** The re-flash drove the
    on-screen `Username:`/`Password:` prompt from the USB keyboard — `4129`
    drained the first report and `4131` then climbed with the keystroke count
    (`events` rising as keys were pressed, `errors=0`). The Pi 4B USB-HID
    keyboard path is end-to-end working; the remaining metal residual is login
    itself (`users_db_read err=12` — no users database, P11 follow-up), not the
    keyboard. Docs: `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`, `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`.
  - **Path forward — the no-touch probe (implemented; `AGENTS.md` §15.7).**
    The user declined the chain-load route, so the gentlest possible
    bring-up is the chosen decisive experiment: `reset_controller` only
    **releases** the bridge `sw_init` the previous boot stage left asserted
    and does **not** re-assert a fundamental reset or toggle the SerDes
    `IDDQ`, leaving any resident VL805 firmware untouched; `train_link`
    deasserts the already-asserted `PERST#` (the single firmware-(re)load
    edge), and the `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` reload stays a best-effort fallback
    issued only when config `0x50` (the `4118` firmware-version wait) stays
    `0` — its outcome no longer aborts the bring-up (see the
    firmware-version-gate bullet above; the gate is now the BAR capability
    block at `Xhci::open`).
    Host-proven by `pcie_brcm::reset_releases_sw_init_without_re_asserting_a_fundamental_reset`
    and `bring_up_releases_sw_init_before_touching_misc_and_skips_the_serdes_toggle`.
    Decisive metal measurement: `4110`/`4114` `vl805_fw_version_hex` going
    non-zero (with a live `CAPLENGTH` at `4107`/`4109`) proves `start4.elf`
    left the firmware resident and our earlier reset was destroying it (the
    in-tree fix is then complete); still `0`/`dead_dead` proves the
    bare-metal handoff genuinely never loads it, leaving a boot-chain /
    firmware matter (a chain-loader that loads the
    VL805 firmware once after PCIe config, or a `start4.elf`/`config.txt`
    change keeping PCIe up across the handoff) as the only remaining path.
    Metal-only either way (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB, §0.4).
- **Outbound-window read-back diagnostic — removed (done, §2.14/§2.16).** A
  one-shot outbound-window read-back (a former `EventId(4111)` over
  `BrcmPcieRc::outbound_window_readback`) originally **pinned the root cause**
  below (`mem_win0_base_limit=0x00003ff0` = an inverted, empty window). It and
  its inbound twin (`EventId(4119)`/`inbound_window_readback`) were removed once
  bring-up was metal-confirmed: reading those MISC registers after the link
  trains stalls for seconds on real BCM2711 silicon while the in-kernel
  bring-up holds the CPU, and they add no functional value with the link up.
  The inverted-window fix is permanent and guarded by the kept driver test
  `outbound_window_decodes_a_non_empty_range_covering_the_cpu_window` (below).
- **Resolved (superseded) — reset the controller before touching MISC,
  unconditionally.** `0xdead_dead` is the **BCM2711 root complex's master-abort
  poison** (distinct from TAIRiX's all-ones `0xffff_ffff` sentinel) — returned
  when a CPU access reaches the RC but no target decodes the address. An
  earlier design read `MISC_PCIE_STATUS` at entry and *skipped* the reset when
  the link was already up, to preserve the bootloader-loaded VL805 firmware.
  The metal captures killed that twice over: the entry status read is itself a
  MISC-block access that master-aborts ~10.8 s **before** the reset (so it
  cannot report the link state — it *is* the bring-up pause, see P4), and
  `entry_link_up` read `0` on every capture because the bootloader hands the
  link off **down** (the standard cold-reset flow), so the skip path never engaged.
  The skip-reset path, `entry_link_up`, and the `4112` log are therefore
  removed (§2.14), and `BrcmPcieRc::bring_up` unconditionally resets, matching
  the BCM2711 PCIe bring-up sequence: cycle the always-accessible RGR1 bridge
  `sw_init` reset (+ `PERST#`) **before** any MISC access, then clear the
  SerDes IDDQ, program the windows, deassert `PERST#`, poll for link-up, ending
  fail-closed (§2.9/§5.4). The firmware the reset drops is reloaded over the
  freshly-trained link via `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` (the working flow on this
  board). Host-proven:
  `bring_up_releases_sw_init_before_touching_misc_and_skips_the_serdes_toggle` +
  `bring_up_trains_the_link_and_programs_the_windows`. The pause vanishing on
  metal is an on-metal acceptance item (QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB, §0.4).
- **Firmware reload sequenced after the VL805's BAR is based (done).** The
  reload fires after the map prefix bases the BAR +
  sets memory/bus-master decode and before the caps wait/`Xhci::open`
  (non-fatal, §2.9/§18.4) — `dev_addr=0x10_0000` and the property message
  match the vendor's VL805 reset message exactly. Its outcome/response
  (`4108`/`4113`) and a post-reload config + cap re-read (`EventId(4114)`,
  `log_post_reload_state`) are logged one-shot. Host-proven:
  `open_controller_reloads_the_firmware_after_the_bar_is_based` and
  `open_controller_skips_the_firmware_reload_when_mapping_fails`.
- **Resolved — the persistent `dead_dead` was an inverted outbound window
  (the firmware-load was a red herring).** With the reload sequenced
  correctly the metal `4114` still showed the VL805 fully present and
  correctly programmed after the reload (`1106:3483`, BAR0 based at
  `0xc000_0000`, mem-space + bus-master enabled) yet the caps stayed
  `dead_dead`; that, plus USB working under other operating systems on the same
  card/firmware, redirected the search from the firmware to the **outbound
  (CPU→PCIe) translation window** (the path config reads do not exercise). The
  bug was in `tairix_drv_bus_pcie_brcm::regs`: the BCM2711 *proprietary*
  `MISC_CPU_2_PCIE_MEM_WIN0_BASE_LIMIT` (`0x4070`) packs the **limit** in bits
  `[31:20]` and the **base** in `[15:4]`,
  but `MEM_WIN0_BASE_LIMIT_BASE_MASK`/`..._LIMIT_MASK` were
  defined with the halves transposed, so `program_outbound_window` wrote the
  base into the limit's half and vice-versa. For the Pi 4 window that yielded
  the metal-captured value `0x00003ff0` = base `0x6_3ff00000` *above* limit
  `0x6_00000000`: an inverted, empty window decoding nothing, so every BAR
  read master-aborted to `dead_dead` regardless of firmware. The fix swaps the
  two mask constants; the expected Pi read-back is
  `mem_win0_base_limit=0x3ff00000` with `base_hi=limit_hi=0x6`.
  Host-proven by
  `outbound_window_decodes_a_non_empty_range_covering_the_cpu_window`
  (decodes the full CPU base/limit with the *hardware* field positions,
  independent of the named constants; fails before the swap with
  `base 0x6_3ff00000 > limit 0x6_00000000`, passes after). The live VL805
  answering a plausible `CAPLENGTH` remains the on-metal acceptance item (§0.4
  — QEMU models no Pi PCIe/USB).
- **Firmware-load instrument — the VL805 `0x50` version register.** The
  `4110`/`4114` config read-backs now also dump `vl805_fw_version_hex` (the
  VL805 XHCI MCU firmware version at PCI config offset `0x50`), the register
  the vendor firmware-init sequence reads to confirm a load (`0` until
  loaded, a non-zero build id once `VideoCore` loads the blob). It is read
  over configuration space, which works on metal even while the BAR aborts,
  so a metal capture now distinguishes "firmware never loaded" (`0x50`=0,
  a board/firmware matter outside TAIRiX code) from "loaded but the BAR
  window still does not decode" (`0x50`≠0) directly, instead of inferring it
  from the `dead_dead` BAR. Host-proven by
  `config_readback_dumps_each_register_once`.
- The seam is the new `kernel/core` `InitSpawnCtx::spawn_kernel_service`
  (admits a `spawn_kthread` whose body drives an object-safe `YieldHandle`,
  so it need not name the port's context-switch type) + `static_frames`
  (the leaked `'static` allocator the DMA region is held from for the
  driver's lifetime, §4).

Host-proven: the `platform::pcie_bringup` decoder tests, the
`keyboard_service` mapper/DMA host capability+bounds tests, and the
kernel-core `spawn_kernel_service` admission test; the freestanding
aarch64 kernel builds with the full wiring. The VL805 BAR now answers a
plausible `CAPLENGTH` on metal; the current fix moves `Xhci::open` past the
halted pre-reset `USBSTS=0x805` (`HCH|HSE|CNR`) and reset-stuck
`USBSTS=0x815` (`HCH|HSE|PCD|CNR`) states by clearing only stale
write-1-to-clear status latches before `HCRST`, then enforcing `CNR` after
reset. Host-proven by `open_resets_a_halted_controller_with_pre_reset_cnr_and_hse`.
**Remaining — metal only:** xHCI reset/start completing on the real VL805 and
a USB keyboard driving the video-console login (the §0.4 on-metal checklist).
The architecturally-correct long-term home is still a `devmgr`-autoloaded
userland keyboard *service* (rides the DriverSpawner-over-IPC gap, Stage
4.HW increment 1); the in-kernel service is the interim. Then the DWC2 OTG
path if needed; then the WM/taskbar/session on the HVS path.

**Migrating the chain onto `hwtree` + `devmgr` autoload, then deleting the
composition module — in progress (`PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW item 5).**
`kernel/tairix-kernel::usb_keyboard` is a *scaffold*: the one crate §17.4
lets name the four driver crates of the Pi 4 chain (`pcie_brcm` →
`pci::mechanism_brcm` → `bus_usb` → `input_usb_hid`). It must not become
the model for board support — one hand-written composition module per board
is exactly the §2.2/§2.3 sprawl to avoid. The scaling-correct steady state
is the §18 data-driven path: every chain node is discovered into the
`hwtree` and `devmgr` autoloads the matching driver against its signed bind
table, so a new board is match **data**, not new code. Sub-increments
(`PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW item 5, one fully-gated landing each):
- **5a — done.** Each chain driver crate owns its canonical bind table as
  `pub const BIND_KEYS` (`pcie_brcm` compatible `brcm,bcm2711-pcie`;
  `bus_usb` xHCI PCI class `0x0C0330` vendor/device-wildcard; `usb_hid`
  HID boot keyboard `0x030101` + mouse `0x030102` vendor/product-wildcard),
  `HwMatchKey`'s constructors are `const`, and `HwMatchKey::matches` adds
  the PCI/USB class-with-wildcard semantics `tairix_devmgr` resolves
  against (no `#[repr(C)]` change, no C-header drift).
- **5b** runtime `hwtree` child attachment by the bus drivers. **5b-i —
  done:** `PciBus::describe_function(bdf, parent_id, node_id)` (lib/abi,
  implemented on `Pci<C>`) returns an enumerated function as a child
  `HwNode` carrying one `HwMatchKey::pci` of its `vendor:device` and **full
  24-bit class** read from config dword 2 (`base<<16|sub<<8|prog_if` — the
  16-bit `BusDevice::class` drops prog_if, so the xHCI `0x0C0330` is told
  apart from older USB host classes), `HwDeviceClass` from the base class,
  fail-closed `NotFound` on an absent function (§2.9/§18.5); a new trait
  method only (no `#[repr(C)]`/C-header drift), host-proven that the VL805
  node matches `bus_usb::BIND_KEYS`. **5b-ii — done:** `bus_usb` emits the
  HID device under the VL805 keyed by its **interface** class
  (`0x030101`/`0x030102`). The enumeration now reads the
  configuration descriptor and parses every default-alternate interface
  descriptor (`InterfaceInfo::decode_all`, fail-closed): the discovered `bConfigurationValue`
  / `bInterfaceNumber` drive `SET_CONFIGURATION` / `SET_PROTOCOL(boot)` (no
  longer hard-coded `1` / `0`), the 24-bit interface class is captured (never
  fabricated, §18.5), and `UsbDevice::describe_device(parent, node)` returns an
  `Input` `HwNode` with one `HwMatchKey::usb` of `vid:pid` + that class (a new
  method only — no C-header drift), host-proven that the `usb_hid::BIND_KEYS`
  keyboard key resolves against it. The remaining sub-increments turn the
  bring-up *around* — from a module that hunts for the keyboard to
  data-driven discovery + `devmgr` autoload (one fully-gated landing each;
  the live VL805 path is a §0.4 metal-acceptance item, so each touching
  chunk lands host tests + a metal checklist and the operator supplies the
  UART log between chunks):
  - **5c-i — done:** the match policy moved out of `devmgr` into the shared
    **`lib/devmatch`** crate (`resolve`/`best_bind_priority`/
    `DriverCandidate`/`MatchResolution`), the single §18.3 definition the
    kernel reaches without a kernel→userland edge (§2.2 / §17.4; `devmgr`
    re-exports it). The in-kernel production driver-candidate catalogue
    (`kernel/tairix-kernel::driver_catalog`) pairs each chain driver's
    canonical `BIND_KEYS` with its `/System/Drivers/` path (authored from
    the crates' tables, never re-typed), and `keyboard_service` gates the
    bring-up on it: `resolve_discovered_bridge` resolves the discovered
    `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` identity (`platform::PCIE_COMPATIBLE` — the
    discovery contract, never a fabricated key, §18.5) against the catalogue
    and proceeds **only on a bound `Winner`** (audit `EventId(4112)`),
    leaving an unmatched/tied node unbound + logged and the service
    unstarted (§18.4 / §2.9). The kernel no longer hunts: it brings the bus
    up because a driver's bind table matched a discovered node. Host-tested;
    the freestanding aarch64 kernel builds with the gate. **Metal checkpoint
    (operator, §0.9):** re-flash, confirm the on-screen `Username:` prompt
    still takes keystrokes (parity), supply the UART log with the `4112`
    bound record.
  - **5c-ii — done:** the in-kernel chain bring-up is admitted through the
    signed-manifest `drvhost::Host::load` gate, not a bare `register()`
    call. `build.rs` (`emit_signed_driver_manifests`) bakes a signed
    `DriverManifest` for each chain driver — `kind = InKernel`, stamped with
    the kernel's `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH`, requesting `CAP_DRV_LOAD`, carrying
    the driver crate's own `BIND_KEYS` — Ed25519-signed with the build's
    deterministic driver-signing key (`KERNEL_DRIVER_SIGNING_SEED`), and
    embeds the matching public key as the kernel's sole driver trust anchor.
    `kernel/tairix-kernel::driver_loader::ChainDriverLoader::admit` runs the
    full `Host::load` pipeline (trust-anchor + signature verification,
    syscall-hash match, `CAP_DRV_LOAD` / `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` gates, bind-table
    validation, in-process `register()` hand-off). The chain `register()`s
    are admission-only (§8 capability check), so the gate uses a plain
    `Host` with no MMIO/DMA host; the real register-window mapping + DMA
    carve still run over the keyboard service's own capability-gated
    `ChainHost` after admission. `keyboard_service::bring_up_keyboard_into_tree`
    admits `pcie_brcm` + `bus_usb` before bring-up (fail closed → no service),
    and **re-matches the enumerated HID child** against the
    catalogue (`bring_up_keyboard` now returns the keyboard + the
    `UsbDevice::describe_device` `HwNode`) and admits `usb_hid` before the
    report pump (fail closed → no input). Audited at `EventId(4132)`.
    `tairix-drvhost` is now an aarch64 dependency. Host-tested
    (`driver_loader` 5 tests: all three baked images verify, the
    `CAP_DRV_LOAD` / `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` / unknown-path refusals fail closed);
    the freestanding aarch64 kernel builds clean. **Metal checkpoint
    (operator, §0.9):** re-flash, confirm the `Username:` prompt still takes
    keystrokes (parity), and supply the UART log showing the `4132` admitted
    records for `pcie_brcm`, `bus_usb`, and `usb_hid`.
  - **5d-0** the `DriverHost` DMA/MMIO surface reachable **over IPC** (the
    standing gap, Stage 4.HW increment 1's remainder). The arch-neutral
    **security foundation is landed**: a new `abi-v1` syscall **`mmio_map`**
    (no. 26, gated on `CAP_MMIO_MAP`, audited) maps a *granted* device MMIO
    window into the calling driver's own address space. A driver passes an
    unforgeable, kernel-issued device-resource grant **handle** (never a raw
    phys address); the kernel-core handler resolves it **against the calling
    task** through the per-task device-resource grant table (owner-checked
    forgery defence, §5.4), validates the grant names a memory window
    (`devres::mappable_window` — `Mmio`/`BusWindow`), and maps only that
    region through the architecture `devres::MmioMapFacility` producer
    (§18.3 — a driver reaches only the resources its matched node requested;
    §4 — no ambient authority). The map facility fails closed to its NULL
    default (`NULL_MMIO_MAP_FACILITY` → `NotImplemented`), exactly as
    `mem_map` shipped its core handler before its arch producer. **5d-0-ii
    (a) — the concrete grant table — LANDED.** The per-task device-resource
    grants live in `kernel/core::aspace::AddressSpaceRegistry` alongside the
    task's streams and limits (the same per-process lifecycle, so a parallel
    per-task registry + lock is avoided, §2.2): `mint_grant(task, resource)`
    issues a per-task, monotonic, never-reused handle from `1` (handle `0`
    reserved-invalid); `grant(task, handle)` resolves it owner-checked (a
    foreign task or unknown handle → `None`, the forgery defence the handler
    relies on); and `withdraw` reclaims every grant when the task exits. The
    `mmio_map` handler now resolves through `aspaces`, and the placeholder
    `devres::ResourceGrants` trait / `EmptyResourceGrants` /
    `NULL_RESOURCE_GRANTS` / `with_resource_grants` seam from the security
    foundation was deleted in place (§2.13 / §2.14). Host-tested (the grant
    store's 6 unit tests + the 5 `mmio_map` handler tests minting real
    grants); no `lib/abi`/C-header change. **5d-0-ii (b) — the guarded
    borrowed-space MMIO mapper mechanism — LANDED.**
    `kernel/mem::mmio::MmioWindowMap` is the per-task guarded MMIO
    virtual-window allocator (bounded window + slot bitmap + per-region
    guard/data accounting) that maps a device window into a **borrowed**
    `&mut AddressSpace<P>` — caching disabled (`NO_CACHE`), never executable
    (W^X, §19.2), unmapped guard pages bracketing every window (§4), and an
    all-or-nothing fail-closed unwind on a part-way page-table failure
    (§2.9). It is the device-window analogue of `kernel/mem::anon`'s
    `map_anonymous` and the mechanism the production `MmioMapFacility` will
    drive against a task's retained live address space. The existing owned
    `MmioMap` (the in-kernel driver-host register-window mapper consumed by
    `KernelMmioMapper`) is now a thin wrapper delegating to `MmioWindowMap`,
    so the guarded logic has one definition (§2.2) with no consumer churn.
    Host-tested (8 borrowed-space tests + the 15 existing `MmioMap` tests
    still green); no `lib/abi`/C-header change. **5d-0-ii (b′)-1 — the
    arch-neutral live-address-space retention mechanism + production
    producers — LANDED (host-proven).** A task's *live, mutable*
    `AddressSpace<P>` is now retainable and reachable from its own syscall
    path, closing the immutable-`FrozenAddressSpace` gap the producers needed:
    - `kernel/mem::live` (`LiveUserSpace` object-safe `Send` trait +
      generic `LiveSpace<P, M>`) erases the live space behind one boundary
      (so `kernel/core` names no concrete `P`, §17.4), composing the audited
      `map_anonymous`/`unmap_anonymous` + `MmioWindowMap` with no second
      mapping path (§2.2); `LiveSpaceError` unions their errors. 7 host tests.
    - `kernel/core::kthread` retains the boxed space in the task's
      `ThreadControl` and **publishes a per-CPU pointer to it** in a new
      `USER_LIVE_SPACE` table — published before switch-in, cleared on
      switch-back, exactly as the existing `USER_RESUME` handle — so the
      access is exclusive to the one CPU running the (trapped) task; the
      `with_current_live_space(cpu, f)` accessor and the
      `spawn_user_kthread_with_stack_live` admission entry expose it. No
      live page table is ever stored behind a shared lock (the documented
      `!Send`/`!Sync` reason a frozen snapshot was used remains intact).
    - `kernel/core::live_producer` (`LiveMemMap<A>` / `LiveMmioMap<A>`,
      holding `&'static A` like `KernelProcessWait`) are the production
      `MemMap` / `MmioMapFacility` producers: they read `arch.current_cpu()`,
      route through `with_current_live_space`, fold `LiveSpaceError`→`Errno`,
      and fail closed (`NotImplemented`) when the running task has no retained
      space. `mmio_map` is fully served (the device window's placement is the
      guarded `MmioWindowMap`); anonymous `mem_map` is served for `FIXED`
      placement, with the non-`FIXED` per-task user-VA placement allocator
      the remaining `SP5b` follow-on (fail-closed `NotImplemented` until
      then — never a guessed base). 8 host tests. fmt + clippy `-D warnings`
      clean; no `lib/abi`/C-header change.
    **5d-0-ii (b′)-2 — retention wired into production (every bare-metal
    port) — LANDED.** The optional live space is threaded through the
    `admit_init` / `admit_process` seam as
    `Option<Box<dyn LiveUserSpace + Send>>`. Every bare-metal port's
    `init_spawn` (PID 1) and `spawn_producer` (the `spawn` syscall's children)
    freezes a snapshot for the copy path **and** builds a `LiveSpace` from the
    *same* arch space (device-window region 1 GiB above the image bias;
    anonymous frames from the `'static` kernel allocator), admitting through
    `spawn_user_kthread_with_stack_live` so the runtime publishes it on the
    per-CPU slot. The MMIO/anon/DMA window offsets are the one shared
    `spawn_layout` definition every port derives its bases from (§2.2); the
    per-port direct map differs (aarch64/riscv64 identity, x86_64 the
    higher-half `KERNEL_VMA_BASE` map the image build also uses). `kernel_main`
    installs `LiveMemMap` / `LiveMmioMap` / `LiveDmaAlloc` for **every** port
    (arch-generic, no `cfg`): a task that retains no live space still fails
    `mem_map` / `mmio_map` / `dma_alloc` closed exactly as the `NULL_*`
    defaults did (wasm32's linear-memory model is an honest n/a). The Arch-HAL
    `PageTableFrames` gained a `Sync` supertrait so a port's `AddressSpace`
    (which retains the frame source) is `Send` and can be the boxed
    `LiveUserSpace` (every implementor was already `Sync`). **Arch fix:**
    `kernel/arch/aarch64::leaf_attrs_for` mapped any `DEVICE` page EL1-only,
    so a user-space driver's `mmio_map` window permission-faulted at EL0; a new
    `el0_device_leaf_attrs` (`AP_RW_EL0`, Device, PXN|UXN) is selected for
    `DEVICE | USER` (regression-tested). Proven on `-M virt` by the
    `mmio_map_qemu_aarch64` vertical: the kernel retains a `LiveSpace`, admits
    the EL0 fixture via `spawn_user_kthread_with_stack_live`, mints a grant for
    the first virtio-MMIO transport, and the program maps it through `mmio_map`
    + reads the `MagicValue` register (`0x74726976`) back. New `tairix_rt::mmio_map`
    wrapper; no `lib/abi`/C-header change. The registry-backed grant
    owner-check (§5.4) is host-proven in `kernel/core`.
    **5d-0-ii (c) — non-`FIXED` `mem_map` placement allocator — LANDED.**
    `kernel/mem::AnonWindowMap` (a per-task user-VA placement allocator: bump
    cursor + free-list of released holes, so a large heap window costs no RAM
    until the frame allocator backs a mapping — §24.1; the placement window is
    address space, the physical backing fails closed as deterministic OOM)
    chooses the base for a non-`FIXED` anonymous mapping. `LiveSpace` carries
    one (`map_anonymous_placed`), composing it with the already-audited
    `map_anonymous`/`unmap_anonymous` (no second mapping path, §2.2);
    `unmap_anonymous` validates + releases the placement record before any
    teardown (fail closed on a wrong base/extent, §5.4). `LiveMemMap::map`
    routes non-`FIXED` requests there while `FIXED` still names `addr_hint`;
    every port's `init_spawn`/`spawn_producer` thread the shared
    `spawn_layout::ANON_WINDOW_OFFSET` (4 GiB above the image bias — the
    topmost user region, above the device/DMA/shared windows) and size the
    window from discovered RAM via `user_windows::user_windows`
    (physical RAM clamped to half the addressable user VA above the base,
    floored at 16 MiB; the demand-paged `file_map` window takes the
    remainder — `docs/src/architecture/memory.md` §7f/§7o), never a fixed
    `const` ceiling (§24.1). Host-tested
    (`user_windows` 7 + `AnonWindowMap` 7 + `LiveSpace`
    placement 4 + `LiveMemMap` routing 2) and proven on `-M virt` by the
    extended `mmio_map_qemu_aarch64` vertical (the EL0 program maps its granted
    window **and** round-trips a placed `mem_map`: map → write sentinel →
    read-back → `mem_unmap`). No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
    **5d-0-ii (c) DMA half — LANDED.** New `abi-v1` syscall **`dma_alloc`**
    (no. 27, `CAP_MEM_DMA`, audited) carves a driver's DMA buffer bounded by
    the grant's `addr_limit` over the same retained-live-space +
    owner-checked-grant machinery (`with_current_live_space`, `Dma`-kind
    grant): it resolves the grant owner-checked, validates it via
    `kernel/core::devres::dma_constraint` (rejecting zero/over-max length),
    carves a physically-contiguous, zeroed, coherent `RW` buffer below the
    grant's `addr_limit` through the `devres::DmaAllocFacility` producer,
    returns the CPU-VA, and copies the device-visible base out to a user
    pointer. The device-visible base is resolved by
    `devres::translate_device_addr`: the CPU-physical base for a coherent
    constraint, or — for a translating inbound viewport
    (`HwResource::dma_translated`, the Pi 4 PCIe `IB MEM 0x0..0x1ffffffff ->
    0x4_0000_0000` `dma-ranges`) — that base re-based onto the far side of the
    viewport, checked/fail-closed (§18.1). The guarded carve has one
    definition — `kernel/mem`'s borrowed `DmaWindowMap`, with the in-kernel
    `DmaPool` re-expressed as its owning wrapper (§2.2); `LiveSpace` gained
    `alloc_dma` + a DMA window and reclaims (zeroes + frees) every live DMA
    block on `Drop` at task exit (§4). `LiveDmaAlloc` is installed for every
    port in `kernel_main`; the aarch64 `init_spawn`/`spawn_producer` thread
    the shared `spawn_layout::DMA_WINDOW_OFFSET`/`PAGES` (3 GiB above the
    image bias). Host-tested (`kernel/mem` carve / addr-limit / Drop-reclaim,
    `devres` constraint, the `dma_alloc` handler, the `LiveDmaAlloc`
    producer, `abi-sys` marshalling) and proven on `-M virt` by the extended
    `mmio_map_qemu_aarch64` vertical (the EL0 program now also carves a
    `dma_alloc` buffer and round-trips a sentinel through it). New
    `tairix_rt::dma_alloc` + `tairix_sys_dma_alloc`; C header regenerated.
  - **5d** the continuous keyboard *service* in **user space**, autoloaded
    by `devmgr` over the 5d-0 surface, feeding the input-focus arbiter.
    - **5d-1 — the rt-backed `DriverHost` (`lib/drvrt`) — DONE
      (host-proven).** The user-space analogue of the in-kernel keyboard
      service's `IdentityMmioMapper` + frame-allocator DMA host: a driver
      process can no longer reach the kernel frame allocator / identity map,
      so `tairix_drvrt::RtDriverHost` implements `DriverHost` + `MmioMapper` +
      `VirtioHost` over a fixed table of kernel-issued device-resource grants
      (`GrantedResource` = handle + `HwResource`). `map_window` resolves a
      requested `(phys,len)` to the covering grant, maps that grant's whole
      window **once** with the `mmio_map` syscall (cached, §2.16), and
      translates an outbound `BusWindow` BAR's PCIe-bus address to the mapped
      CPU window (§18.1); `alloc_dma_zeroed` carves the device-shared region
      with `dma_alloc` against the DMA grant and mints a `DmaSlab` (device
      base from the grant, optional caller-supplied non-coherent
      `SlabCoherencyFn` — the shim is never synthesised in this
      platform-neutral crate, §2.20). The two syscalls sit behind the
      host-testable `GrantSyscalls` seam (production `RtGrantSyscalls` forwards
      to `tairix_rt`, §2.2); the host adds no authority — every capability +
      bound is re-checked kernel-side and a forged/foreign handle fails closed
      (§4/§5.4/§2.9). Allocation-free (`MAX_GRANTS` array) so it works before
      the SP5b heap. 18 host tests (window resolve, sub-offset, BAR
      translation, map-once, every fail-closed path, DMA carve + coherency,
      multi-grant resolution); registered in §3 + `SUMMARY.md`; docs
      `docs/src/lib/drvrt.md`. **No metal/virt step** (no production
      grant-minter/driver-process consumer yet — that is 5d-2).
    - **5d-2-i — the `resource_grants` grant-delivery syscall — DONE
      (host-proven).** The piece `RtDriverHost` consumes to learn *which*
      handles it holds: new `abi-v1` syscall **`resource_grants`** (no. 28,
      **no capability** — a task reads only its own grants, the §16.6/§24.3
      own-process baseline; unaudited) serialises the **calling task's** minted
      grant set from the same per-task `AddressSpaceRegistry` grant table as
      consecutive `tairix_abi::hwtree::GrantedResource` records (handle +
      `HwResource`, `WIRE_LEN` = 40; the one wire/owning definition, re-exported
      by `lib/drvrt`, §2.2), copies them out through the validated boundary, and
      returns the byte count — `0` for an unbound task (§18.4), `BufferTooSmall`
      rather than a partial list (§2.9), `BadAddress` for an unregistered caller
      (§19.1). `AddressSpaceRegistry::grants_to_le_bytes` does the
      ascending-handle serialisation; `RtDriverHost::from_grants_query` is the
      production constructor that issues the syscall into a fixed `MAX_GRANTS`
      buffer and builds the grant table (`RtDriverHost::new` keeps the
      caller-supplied-slice path for tests/verticals). New
      `tairix_rt::resource_grants` + `tairix_sys_resource_grants`; C header
      regenerated. Host-tested (abi round-trip + decode-reject, 5 kernel-core
      handler tests, 4 drvrt `from_grants_query` tests, abi-sys marshal). **No
      metal/virt step** (no production grant-minter / driver-process consumer
      yet — that is 5d-2-ii).
    - **5d-2-ii (a) — the production driver-spawn grant minter — DONE
      (host-proven + `-M virt`).** The privileged driver-spawn path now mints
      the spawned driver's device-resource grants at admission: `KernelSpawnCtx`
      carries a `grants: &[HwResource]` (the matched node's requested
      resources, kernel-sourced — never an untrusted caller, §4), and
      `admit_process` calls `AddressSpaceRegistry::mint_grant(child, resource)`
      once per resource after the child is fully registered, keyed to the
      child's own kernel-trusted id (owner-checked, monotonic handles from 1,
      reclaimed on exit). The ordinary `spawn` syscall passes an **empty**
      slice — a user task grants no device windows (§4/§5.2). The child reads
      its handles back through `resource_grants` (5d-2-i). Host-tested in
      kernel/core (mint-per-resource, owner-check, `GrantedResource`
      serialisation, the empty-grant user-spawn case) and proven on `-M virt`
      by the extended `driver_spawn_qemu_aarch64` vertical: the stub is spawned
      through the production `KernelSpawnCtx`/`spawn_with` with a granted
      MMIO window, enumerates it via `resource_grants` (handle 1, MMIO,
      non-zero length), and refuses to reply on any shortfall — so the host
      PASS proves the spawn minted and delivered the grant. No `lib/abi`/
      C-header change (the grants are a kernel-side ctx field).
    - **5d-2-ii (b-1) — the `devmgr`-driven driver-spawn path — done
      (host-proven + `-M virt`).** `devmgr::DriverLoader::load` gained a
      `resources: &[HwResource]` argument that `DeviceManager::autoload`
      sources from the matched `HwNode::resources`, realising §18.3 (a loaded
      driver receives only the resources its matched node requested). The
      production loader `kernel/tairix-kernel::driver_spawn_loader::
      SpawnDriverLoader` (impl `devmgr::DriverLoader`) runs the signed
      `drvhost::Host::load` gate on the discovered `kind = UserSpace` image and
      spawns the verified payload through the arch `DriverProcessSpawn` seam,
      threading those resources into `KernelSpawnCtx.grants` (the (a) minter).
      Host-tested with a recording spawn double; proven end to end on `-M virt`
      by the extended `driver_spawn_qemu_aarch64` vertical (discovered virtio
      node → `13001` node-bound → signed gate → spawn → grant read back via
      `resource_grants` → `4302` PASS). **Security hardening (§2.17):** the
      `drvhost` manifest signature now covers the **payload**, so a spawned
      driver's program is authenticated (regression `tampered_payload_refused`);
      empty-payload in-kernel images are unaffected.
    - **5d-2-ii (b-2-i) — `lib/usb` extraction — done (host-proven + whole
      gate).** The §17.4 layering forbids a `drivers/*`/`userland/*` crate from
      depending on another `drivers/*` crate, so an arch-neutral user-space
      keyboard driver could not compose `drivers/bus/usb` (xHCI) with
      `drivers/input/usb_hid` (HID decode) while the xHCI protocol sat inside
      the bus driver. The bus-agnostic xHCI protocol (`RegisterBlock` register seam,
      `Xhci` controller engine, TRB/ring vocabulary, single-device HID
      `UsbDevice` enumeration) therefore moved into a new `lib/usb`
      (`tairix-usb`, `lib/abi`-only, `no_std`, Tier-1-portable) — the USB
      analogue of `lib/virtio` ↔ `drivers/bus/virtio` (§2.2/§6/§17.4).
      `drivers/bus/usb` keeps only the §8 `register`, the §18.3 `BIND_KEYS`, and
      the PCI BAR/DMA `wiring` over `tairix_usb`; the kernel scaffold + `wiring`
      repoint to `tairix_usb::{Xhci, device::*, regs}`. The 81 USB tests split
      with the code (71 protocol `lib/usb` + 10 driver `register`/bind/wiring);
      whole gate green (`cargo xtask ci` incl. both Pi images, `fuzz --secs 5`,
      `soak both`, `cargo xtask test --qemu`). Docs: `docs/src/lib/usb.md`,
      `docs/src/drivers/bus.md`, the two crate READMEs, AGENTS.md §3 + SUMMARY.
    - **5d-2-ii (b-2-ii) — generic boot-keyboard orchestration + shared
      `Delay` seam — done (host-proven).** The arch-neutral
      root→hub→downstream-HID bring-up sequence is now one definition,
      `tairix_usb::device::UsbDevice::enumerate_boot_keyboard(delay)` in
      `lib/usb` (§2.2/§18): enumerate the first connected root-hub port and,
      when it is a hub (the Pi 4B onboard hub), power its ports, settle, find
      the connected one, reset it, settle, and address the device behind it on
      a second slot — discovered, never a guessed port, failing closed. Its
      timed settles use the microsecond `Delay` seam, hoisted from
      `drivers/bus/pcie_brcm` into `lib/abi` (`tairix_abi::Delay`) so the PCIe
      and USB driver crates share one trait (§2.2; `pcie_brcm` re-exports it,
      callers unchanged; a trait, so no C-header change). The in-kernel
      `keyboard_service` scaffold's `bring_up_keyboard` now calls the shared
      routine and its duplicated `log_hub_ports`/`address_downstream_keyboard`/
      `log_downstream_keyboard` + the `4127`/`4128` event-ids are deleted
      (§2.2/§2.14). Host-proven (`lib/usb` 74 tests incl.
      `enumerate_boot_keyboard_{returns_a_directly_attached_keyboard,
      descends_through_a_hub_to_the_keyboard,
      fails_closed_when_a_hub_has_no_connected_downstream}`; kernel lib tests
      green). Docs: `docs/src/lib/usb.md`, `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md`.
      Touches the metal-confirmed scaffold bring-up (behaviour-equivalent by
      construction) ⇒ an operator §0.9 metal re-verify (parity: the on-screen
      `Username:` prompt still takes keystrokes).
    - **5d-2-ii (b-2-ii) — arch-neutral boot-keyboard orchestration — done
      (host-proven).** `drivers/input/usb_hid::service::bring_up_boot_keyboard`
      is the composition the user-space keyboard driver runs at start-up. Over
      its `DriverHost` (the rt-backed host built from its kernel-issued grants)
      it builds the growable `tairix_usb::SlabBank` over its host's DMA seam
      with the discovered aperture top (every chunk is aperture-checked at
      allocation time, fail closed, §5.4), maps its granted xHCI register
      BAR, brings the controller up (`tairix_usb::Xhci::open` +
      `UsbDevice::start`, growing the geometry-sized shared chunk — the one
      engine definition in `lib/usb`, §2.2), and runs the
      arch-neutral `enumerate_boot_keyboard`, returning a `BootKeyboard` the
      service loop drives with `pump_once`. It names no PCI/BCM2711/board
      (§2.20): the board PCIe root-complex bring-up + BAR assignment stay in the
      separate board bus driver, and the keyboard node is granted only its
      already-assigned BAR + a DMA constraint (§18.3). `usb_hid` now depends on
      `lib/usb` (a lib, §17.4). Host-proven (6 `service` tests: the cap-missing /
      no-mapper / no-DMA-host refusals, a DMA carve above the aperture and a
      DMA-alloc failure refused, and the all-valid path reaching the controller
      hand-off where the inert mock window faults `DeviceFault` — the metal
      boundary, mirroring `bus_usb`'s `wiring` tests). No `lib/abi`/C-header
      change; whole gate green. Docs: `docs/src/drivers/input.md`,
      `docs/src/lib/usb.md`, both crate READMEs.
    - **5d-2-ii (b-2-iii) — done (host-proven + `-M virt`)** the
      `devmgr`-autoloaded keyboard driver `rxe`: the autoloadable driver, the
      signed-bundle root fixture, and the `-M virt` autoload vertical are
      landed (the per-piece status follows). What remains under this item is
      the `tools/mkimage` signed bundle and the 5e flip, both gated below.
      - **`lib/hid` extraction + the keyboard driver `rxe` binary — done
        (host-proven, all three Tier-1 targets).** The §17.4 layering forbids a
        `drivers/*`/`userland/*` crate from depending on another `drivers/*`
        crate, and the kernel still links `drivers/input/usb_hid` for the
        transitional in-kernel scaffold (so adding the userland runtime
        `tairix-rt` there would inject a duplicate `panic_impl`/`_start` into the
        kernel). Both are resolved by extracting the reusable HID logic into a
        **new `lib/hid` (`tairix-hid`)** crate — the decoders (`BootKeyboard`,
        `HidMouse`), the console producer (`KeyboardConsole`, `pump_once`,
        `ConsoleSink`), and the xHCI boot-keyboard orchestration
        (`bring_up_boot_keyboard`, `derive_keyboard_resources`,
        `KeyboardResources`) — the USB analogue of `lib/usb` ↔ `drivers/bus/usb`
        (§2.2 / §6 / §17.4). `drivers/input/usb_hid` shrinks to the §8 driver
        identity (`register` + `BIND_KEYS`, `lib/abi`-only). The kernel scaffold
        repoints its decode/console imports to `tairix_hid` (keeping `register`
        + `BIND_KEYS` from `usb_hid`). The new **`drivers/input/usb_kbd`
        (`tairix-drv-input-usb-kbd`, `src/main.rs`)** binary is the
        `devmgr`-autoloaded user-space keyboard driver: a pure-Rust `tairix-rt`
        program depending **only** on `lib/*` (hid/drvrt/rt/caps/abi, so §17.4
        holds and the kernel never links `tairix-rt`) that builds
        `RtDriverHost::from_grants_query` over its kernel-issued grants
        (coherency `None` — the kernel carves coherent DMA, platform-neutral
        §2.20), derives its BAR + DMA aperture from the same delivered grants
        with the new host-tested `tairix_hid::derive_keyboard_resources` over the
        new `RtDriverHost::resources()` accessor (no second `resource_grants`
        syscall, §2.16), runs `bring_up_boot_keyboard`, then loops `pump_once`
        with a `KeyInjectSink` over `key_inject` and the userland `ClockDelay`,
        yielding between polls (§2.1). Fail-closed exit codes (§2.9); every
        capability + bound re-checked kernel-side (§5.4).
        `derive_keyboard_resources` handles the Pi 4 shape (outbound `BusWindow`
        BAR + translated inbound `Dma`) and the `virt` shape (`Mmio` BAR +
        untranslated `Dma`), ignores an IRQ grant, and refuses a
        missing/ambiguous/zero-length grant. Host-proven (`tairix-hid` 45 tests
        incl. 9 derivation cases; `usb_hid` 4; `drvrt` 24 incl. 2 `resources()`);
        usb_kbd + the aarch64 kernel build freestanding on all three Tier-1
        targets. **No `lib/abi`/C-header change.** No metal step yet (additive;
        the in-kernel scaffold still drives the metal keyboard until the boot
        wiring lands and 5e retires it). Docs: `docs/src/lib/hid.md`,
        `docs/src/drivers/input.md`, `docs/src/lib/drvrt.md`, the crate READMEs;
        AGENTS.md §3 + SUMMARY.md gained `lib/hid`.
      - **Scheduler-agnostic kernel/core spawn-with seam — done (host-proven).**
        The production boot wiring is "hosted in `kernel/core`, which owns the
        scheduler", but the bin crate must not name the concrete scheduler
        (§17.1) and kernel/core cannot depend on `tairix_devmgr` (userland,
        §17.4). The seam that resolves this is now landed: the kernel/core
        [`ProcessSpawn`] trait gained `spawn_with(rxe, ctx, granted, args)` (the
        driver-spawn analogue of `spawn(EmbeddedProgram, ctx)` — raw image bytes
        + the manifest∩caller capability set + the node grants riding on `ctx`,
        §18.3), so a generic caller holding `&dyn ProcessSpawn` can spawn a
        driver into its own hardware-isolated process without naming the port's
        spawn mechanism or the selected scheduler. The default fails closed
        (`Errno::NotImplemented`, §2.9); the aarch64 producer's former
        arch-inherent `spawn_with` is now that trait method (one definition,
        §2.2), and the `driver_spawn_qemu_aarch64` `-M virt` vertical drives the
        chain through it. No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
      - **Signed-store candidate scan — done (host-proven).** The §18.3 store
        scan that turns the installed `/System/Drivers/` bundles into autoload
        candidates is landed as `tairix_drvhost::store`
        (`userland/system/drvhost/src/store.rs`): `scan_store(source, paths,
        sink) -> DriverStore` reads each enumerated bundle through the existing
        `ImageSource`, parses its `.rxe` manifest with the same `ParsedImage`
        splitter the load gate uses (no drift, §2.2), decodes its bind table
        fail-closed, and emits an owned `ScannedDriver` whose
        `DriverStore::candidates()` lends the canonical
        `tairix_devmatch::DriverCandidate` slice `DeviceManager::autoload`
        consumes. The scan is a **match** step only — it grants no authority and
        verifies no signature; signature/syscall-hash/capability/`kind`
        verification stay at `Host::load` when (and only when) a candidate wins
        a node (§18.6). An unreadable/malformed/bad-bind bundle is skipped and
        logged (`DRIVER_STORE_ENTRY_SKIPPED` 7031), never fatal (§18.4/§5.4);
        an accepted one is audited `DRIVER_STORE_CANDIDATE` 7030. drvhost gained
        a `lib/devmatch` dep (lib/* only, §17.4) and reuses its own `HandleBuf`
        decimal formatter (§2.2). Host-proven (8 `store::tests`: order-preserved
        accepts, each fail-closed skip reason, empty store, end-to-end through
        the real `devmatch::resolve`). No `lib/abi`/C-header change. Docs:
        `docs/src/drivers/host.md` ("Signed-store scan"). No metal step (the
        scan has no production consumer yet — the boot wiring below is next).
      - **`/System/Drivers/` store enumeration (kernel half) — done
        (host-proven).** `tairix_kernel_core::driver_store::enumerate_driver_store`
        is the boot-time walk that turns the on-disk store tree into the bundle
        image-path list `scan_store` consumes. Mirroring `users::load_users_db`,
        it builds the shared root-backed VFS (`crate::fs::root_backed_vfs` — the
        private-root-mount handle + minimal `Vfs` builder hoisted out of
        `users.rs`, §2.2) and walks `/System/Drivers/` through the §5.3-checked
        per-inode delegation under the uid-0 bootstrap identity (no §5.1 bypass),
        collecting every regular file's path. Structural path discovery only — it
        never reads, parses, or trusts a bundle (the load gate does, §18.6); the
        walk is bounded (`MAX_STORE_DEPTH` 8 / `MAX_STORE_DRIVERS` 256, §24.4)
        and fail-closed: a missing store, an unreadable sub-directory, or a
        malformed entry simply contributes fewer paths and never aborts the boot
        (§18.4/§2.9). One audit record `DriverStoreScanned` (4042, `drivers` /
        `skipped` counts). Host-proven (7 `driver_store` tests over a tree mock
        fs: nested store in order, missing store, unreadable-subdir skip,
        depth/count bounds, empty store). No `lib/abi`/C-header change. Docs:
        `docs/src/architecture/kernel.md` (audit catalogue). No metal step (no
        production consumer yet — the boot wiring below is next).
      - **VFS-backed `ImageSource` (the bundle-byte reader) — done
        (host-proven).** The enumeration above yields the bundle *paths*; this
        reads their *bytes*. `tairix_kernel_core::driver_store::DriverImageReader`
        builds the shared root-backed VFS once (§2.16) and `read_image(fs, path,
        buf)` reads one bundle off the mounted root under the uid-0 bootstrap
        identity: it validates the path lies strictly within `/System/Drivers/`,
        bounds the file against `MAX_DRIVER_IMAGE_LEN` (16 MiB §24.4) *before*
        any read, reads the whole file, and **appends** it to `buf` (the
        `ImageSource` contract), failing closed and leaving `buf` untouched on
        any refusal (§5.4/§2.9); `DriverImageError`→`Errno`. The `ImageSource`
        trait is `drvhost`'s (userland) and §17.4 forbids a `kernel/core`→drvhost
        edge, so the bin crate (the one layer that may name `drvhost`) supplies
        the thin delegating adapter `tairix_kernel::driver_store_source::VfsImageSource`
        — `DriverImageReader` + the root-volume driver behind a `RefCell` (the
        `&self` `read` vs `&mut` driver bridge; the scan is single-threaded, one
        bundle at a time), adding no authority. Host-proven (11 kernel-core
        reader tests: byte-for-byte, append, empty, out-of-store, missing,
        directory, oversize-before-read, gated-unreadable, short-read unwind,
        errno map; 4 bin-crate adapter tests: delegate+append, multi-bundle one
        borrow, missing→`NotFound`, out-of-store→`PermissionDenied`). No
        `lib/abi`/C-header change. Docs: `docs/src/drivers/host.md` ("Reading
        the bundle bytes off the root volume"). No metal step (no production
        consumer yet — the boot wiring below is next).
      - **Boot-wiring composition — done (host-proven).**
        `tairix_kernel::driver_autoload::autoload_drivers(tree, store_paths,
        image_source, trusted, spawn, args, caller_caps, sink)` is the single
        production composition that turns the discovered hardware tree + the
        installed signed store into autoloaded user-space drivers: it scans the
        store (`drvhost::store::scan_store` over the `VfsImageSource` against
        the `enumerate_driver_store` paths — a match-only step, §18.6), runs
        `devmgr::DeviceManager::autoload` over the candidates, and loads each
        winner through `driver_spawn_loader::SpawnDriverLoader` (signed
        `Host::load` gate → process spawn with exactly the matched node's
        resource grants, §18.3). It adds no policy; it lives in the bin crate
        (the one layer that may name both `devmgr` and `drvhost`, §17.4) and
        takes the spawn mechanism behind the `DriverProcessSpawn` seam so it
        stays scheduler-agnostic (§17.1). Host-proven (5 `driver_autoload`
        tests: a signed match spawns with exactly the node's two resources, an
        untrusted signature fails the node closed and never spawns, a caller
        without `CAP_DRV_LOAD` loads nothing, an unmatched node is left unbound,
        an empty store binds nothing). No `lib/abi`/C-header change. Docs:
        `docs/src/drivers/host.md` ("Autoloading by discovery").
      - **Mounted-root composition — done (host-proven).**
        `tairix_kernel::driver_autoload::autoload_from_mounted_root(fs, tree,
        trusted, spawn, args, caller_caps, sink)` is the thin production glue
        the live boot path drives once the root is mounted: it sources the
        store paths *and* the bundle bytes from the just-mounted root volume
        `fs` (the arxfs driver) — `enumerate_driver_store(fs, …)` for the
        §5.3-checked path walk, then a `VfsImageSource` over the *same* `fs`
        for the bytes (the two `&mut fs` reads are strictly sequential, so the
        one borrow never overlaps) — and defers entirely to `autoload_drivers`
        for match + signed gate + spawn. It adds no policy and fails closed
        only if the private root mount cannot be built (`VfsError`); a missing
        / empty / malformed store binds nothing in `Ok` (§18.4 / §2.9).
        Host-proven (3 `driver_autoload` tests over the shared `MockRootFs`
        fixture: a planted signed bundle is *discovered* and spawned with
        exactly the node's resources, an empty store binds nothing, an
        untrusted bundle fails the node closed). No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
        Docs: `docs/src/drivers/host.md` ("Autoloading by discovery").
      - **Scheduler-agnostic driver-spawn seam — done (host-proven + `-M
        virt`).** `InitSpawnCtx::spawn_driver_process(spawn, path, rxe, caps,
        grants, args, node_id)` (default fail-closed `NotImplemented`, §2.9)
        is the production
        seam a scheduler-agnostic caller drives to spawn a verified driver
        into its own process: the kernel/core `KernelInitSpawner` impl builds
        the live `KernelSpawnCtx` (the matched node's `grants` minted
        owner-checked, §18.3; the driver established `DescriptorTable::closed`
        — a driver is not a text session, §20; recorded against the kernel
        boot supervisor `SecTaskId(0)`; the child's process name attested
        from the kernel-resolved driver-store `path` via the shared
        `ProcName::from_path` rule — a bundle's generic `Run` entry point
        names its owning driver directory, any other path its final
        component — so `ps`/`top` always name the driver, never `Run`) and
        drives the architecture's
        `ProcessSpawn::spawn_with`, so the bin crate never names the
        feature-selected scheduler or `KernelSpawnCtx` (§17.1). `KernelInitSpawner`
        is now public + constructible (`new`, holding the leaked-`'static`
        `ProcessWait` `run_phases` hands back) for the same "verticals drive the
        production path, not a copy" reason `KernelSpawnCtx` is (§2.2). The
        bin-crate `driver_spawn_loader::InitCtxDriverProcessSpawn`
        (`DriverProcessSpawn` over a `&dyn InitSpawnCtx` + the arch
        `&dyn ProcessSpawn`) is the bridge `SpawnDriverLoader` reaches it
        through. Host-proven (kernel/core: default-fail-closed +
        delegation-to-a-recording-producer; bin crate: the adapter forwards
        payload/caps/grants/args unchanged) and the `driver_spawn_qemu_aarch64`
        `-M virt` vertical now drives the chain through this seam (no
        hand-built `KernelSpawnCtx`). No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
      - **Boot-path attachment — done (host-proven + `-M virt`).** The
        production unlock kthread now runs the autoload composition off the
        just-mounted root. Landed: the `'static`-spawner seam
        (`InitSpawn::spawn_init` takes `&'static (dyn InitSpawnCtx + Sync)`,
        `kernel_main` leaks the ctx, forwarded through the three arch
        `init_spawn` seams to `unlock_service::spawn_if_present`); the
        discovered-hardware-tree stash (`audit_root_storage_binding` collects
        the full tree — virtio-MMIO block child probed in — and `record_boot`
        resolves the root binding from it and moves it into `HW_TREE`); and
        the unlock-kthread tail call (`aarch64::root_unlock::run_unlock` builds
        an arch-neutral `unlock_service::AutoloadHook` over the stashed tree +
        the leaked `'static` ctx and hands it to
        `unlock_root_disk_interactively` as the `MountedRootHook`, which calls
        `autoload_from_mounted_root` the instant the root mounts — binding
        nothing when no node matches, §18.4). Empty store ⇒ nothing autoloads
        in `Ok`. The autoloadable user-space input driver is **now landed** (the
        first sub-bullet); **remaining** is its `-M virt` autoload vertical, the
        signed bundle, and the 5e flip:
        - the autoloadable **user-space input driver `rxe`** the `-M virt`
          vertical proves: `-M virt` presents a **virtio-input** keyboard
          (not USB/xHCI — no QEMU vertical models xHCI), served by
          `drivers/input/virtio_input`. The driver's §18.3 `BIND_KEYS` bind
          table is **landed** (`HwMatchKey::virtio(18)` at the exact-match
          priority tier — the single source of truth its signed manifest is
          authored from; host-tested + README/`docs/src/drivers/input.md`).
          The reusable `open`/`poll`/`decode` device logic is **now extracted**
          to the new `lib/virtio_input` (`tairix-virtio-input`) crate — the
          §17.4 analogue of `lib/hid` ↔ `usb_hid` — so both the in-kernel
          `-M virt` verticals and the user-space `rxe` compose it without a
          `drivers/*`→`drivers/*` edge; `drivers/input/virtio_input` is now the
          thin §8 `register` + `BIND_KEYS` shell (the device id is
          `tairix_virtio_input::VIRTIO_INPUT_DEVICE_ID`), and the
          `virtio_qemu_support` harness consumes `VirtioInput` from the lib.
          Host-proven (`tairix-virtio-input` 9 device-logic tests, driver shell
          2). The **lib-reachable concrete virtio MMIO transport** the
          user-space driver needs is **now landed**: `MmioTransport` moved from
          `drivers/bus/virtio` into `lib/virtio` (it depends only on the
          bounds-checked `RegisterWindow` + the protocol types), so an
          arch-neutral `drivers/input/*` `rxe` can build it without a
          `drivers/*`→`drivers/*` edge (§17.4 — the `lib/usb` ↔ `drivers/bus/usb`
          precedent). `drivers/bus/virtio` re-exports it from `tairix_virtio`
          (existing `tairix_drv_bus_virtio::MmioTransport` import sites resolve
          unchanged, §2.2); §3, `docs/src/drivers/virtio.md`, and the
          `transport_mmio` tests moved with it. The autoloadable `rxe`
          **binary is now landed**: `drivers/input/virtio_kbd`
          (`tairix-drv-input-virtio-kbd`, `src/main.rs`) is the `usb_kbd`
          analogue — a freestanding `tairix-rt` program depending only on
          `lib/*` (`lib/virtio`, `lib/virtio_input`, `lib/drvrt`, `lib/rt`,
          `lib/caps`, `lib/abi`) that builds `RtDriverHost::from_grants_query`
          over its kernel-issued grants, resolves its sole granted register
          window with the new `tairix_abi::driver::sole_register_window`
          (built on `HwResource::register_window_base`, the one §2.2 definition
          of "which address names this resource's register window" — shared
          with `lib/hid`'s `derive_keyboard_resources`), maps it, builds the
          `MmioTransport`, runs `VirtioInput::open` over the host as
          `VirtioHost`, and loops `poll` → `VirtioKeyboardConsole::feed` →
          `key_inject` (the new `evdev`-keycode console producer in
          `lib/virtio_input`, resolving the US layout through the shared
          `tairix_keymap::key_input`, §2.2). The
          `virtio_driver_layer_is_on_lib_only` deps-check binds the new crate to
          `lib/virtio` (not the bus driver). Host-proven (`lib/abi`
          `sole_register_window`/`register_window_base` tests,
          `lib/virtio_input` `console` tests; the binary builds host + all three
          Tier-1 freestanding); whole gate green (`cargo xtask ci` incl. both
          Pi images, `fuzz --secs 5`, soak). No `lib/abi`/C-header change (the
          helper is a Rust fn, not a `#[repr(C)]` type/syscall). This is the
          most architecturally honest "driver in user space by discovery" proof
          on the hardware `virt` actually has (the metal Pi keyboard stays
          `usb_kbd`, flipped at 5e). **Remaining** is the vertical + bundle:
        - **virtio-input hardware-tree discovery — done (host-proven).** The
          bootstrap-floor virtio-MMIO enumeration now also discovers
          **user-space-autoloadable input devices**:
          `hwdiscovery::observe_virtio_mmio_input_devices` probes each
          `virtio,mmio` slot's `DeviceID` for virtio-input
          (`VIRTIO_INPUT_DEVICE_ID = 18`) and emits a discovered
          `HwDeviceClass::Input` node keyed by `HwMatchKey::virtio(18)` and
          carrying `HwResource::mmio(base, len)`. Unlike the in-kernel block
          floor (whose bring-up re-derives the window from the tree by base) a
          user-space input driver is minted a grant per requested resource
          (§18.3), so the node **must** carry its window; the extent is the
          discovered `reg` length surfaced by the new
          `VirtioMmioBus::slot_window` (§18.1 — discovered, never a literal),
          implemented in `drivers/bus/mmio`. Wired into
          `aarch64::boot::audit_root_storage_binding` beside the block probe,
          so the leaked hardware tree the unlock kthread autoloads against
          carries the input node. Additive + metal-neutral (no `virtio,mmio`
          on the Pi tree, §2.17); host-tested (`root_storage` input-discovery
          tests, `slot_window` in `lib/abi` + `drivers/bus/mmio`); whole gate
          green incl. the full `-M virt` matrix. This is the discovery the
          autoload spawn below binds against.
        - the `-M virt` autoload vertical — **done**.
          `tests/integration/autoload_input_qemu_aarch64` boots the production
          aarch64 pipeline on `virt` with the shared encrypted-root whole-disk
          fixture, planted with the kernel-signed autoload driver bundles the
          `image_drivers` pipeline cross-compiles and signs (the
          `virtio_kbd.rxe` bundle at `/System/Drivers/input/virtio_kbd/Run`),
          and an attached
          `virtio-keyboard-device`. The runner types the passphrase; the unlock
          kthread mounts the root, and its post-mount `AutoloadHook` scans the
          signed store, verifies the bundle against the kernel's embedded
          `KERNEL_DRIVER_SIGNER_PUBKEY`, matches it to the discovered
          virtio-input node, and spawns it into its own user-space process; the
          injected key is decoded and delivered via `key_inject`, and the audit
          sink reports PASS on `AuditEvent::InputDelivered` (`EventId(4050)`).
          The `image_drivers` pipeline (`build_virtio_kbd_bundle`, the one
          definition every image consumer shares, §2.2) cross-compiles
          `drivers/input/virtio_kbd` PIE (the one shared `lib/rt/Run.ld` every
          `Run` program links), converts it to an `rxe` relocated for the shared
          `tairix_itest_harness::USER_IMAGE_BIAS`, and signs it via the shared
          `tairix_itest_harness::driver_image` composer with
          `build_support::KERNEL_DRIVER_SIGNING_SEED` over the driver's own
          `BIND_KEYS` + caps (`CAP_MMIO_MAP`/`CAP_MEM_DMA`/`CAP_INPUT_INJECT`).
          The autoload caller presents the delegatable
          `unlock_service::autoload_caps` superset (`service_caps` +
          `CAP_INPUT_INJECT` + `CAP_IRQ_BIND` + `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`), so an
          autoloaded input driver's
          manifest∩caller intersection can grant the injection authority while
          the unlock kthread's own context stays minimal (§5.2 / §5.4). The
          seed-hoist and one-shot `InputDelivered` witness prerequisites are
          done; the signed bundle is host-proven valid + matched over the real
          `scan_store`/`devmatch` path (the `image_drivers` autoload-decision
          tests);
        - `tools/mkimage` laying the signed input-driver bundle into the
          signed driver store, signed with the kernel's driver-signing trust
          anchor (a seed shared in one place with the kernel build, §2.2) —
          deferred with (d). **Superseded by design B (see "Pre-unlock signed
          driver store" below):** the store must live on a volume reachable
          *before* the encrypted-root passphrase, so the bundle is laid into
          the read-only `/System` volume, not the encrypted root.
        - **5e / (d):** flip `init_spawn`'s
          `keyboard_service::bring_up_keyboard_into_tree` / `spawn_pump`
          to the autoload path and delete the in-kernel scaffold + evict
          `usb_hid` from `driver_catalog::IN_KERNEL_DRIVERS`, in the same change
          (§2.14). **This is the *last* design-B increment** (see below): it is
          blocked not merely on a §0.9 metal re-flash but on the pre-unlock
          `/System`-volume store, the metal USB→`hwtree` enumeration, and the
          live EMMC2 root bring-up all landing first. Until then the in-kernel
          scaffold stays the metal keyboard driver and stays wired, so the
          working metal keyboard never regresses (§2.17).
      - **Userland clock + `Delay` prerequisite — done (host-proven).**
        `tairix_rt::clock_get` (the first-party wrapper over `abi-v1` syscall 7,
        the raw `u64` nanosecond reading, no coarsening of its own) and
        `tairix_rt::ClockDelay` — the one userland `tairix_abi::Delay`
        implementation (`delay_us` parks cooperatively via `clock_get` +
        `yield_now`, never a hard spin §2.1; `now_us` floors the reading to
        whole microseconds) — live in the single userland runtime so every
        driver process shares one clock-backed `Delay` rather than each rolling
        its own (§2.2). This is the `Delay` the keyboard-driver binary hands to
        `service::bring_up_boot_keyboard`. Host-proven (`tairix-rt` tests: the
        `clock_get` trap marshalling via the `abi-trap` seam, `now_us`
        flooring, and the cooperative-wait core `spin_until_ns` — past-deadline
        returns without yielding, advancing-clock yields a bounded count). No
        `lib/abi`/C-header change (the syscall already existed).
  - **5e** delete `usb_keyboard.rs` + `keyboard_service.rs` (§2.14) and evict
    `usb_hid` from `driver_catalog::IN_KERNEL_DRIVERS` (§18.6) once the
    generic path drives the chain end to end on metal — the **last** design-B
    increment (below).

#### Pre-unlock signed driver store (design B) — the correct §18 keyboard-at-unlock path

**The constraint that fixes the design.** On metal the USB keyboard is needed
to *type the encrypted-root unlock passphrase* (`root_unlock.rs`:
`video::is_active()` reads `VIDEO_KEYBOARD`). The keyboard driver therefore
cannot be autoloaded *from* the encrypted root — that volume is not mounted
until the passphrase is entered (chicken-and-egg). The proven `-M virt`
autoload vertical sidesteps this only because its passphrase is typed on the
UART while the keyboard driver autoloads *post-mount*. A keyboard-served
HDMI unlock prompt needs the input driver up **before** unlock.

**The decision (operator-approved): a dedicated read-only, signed `/System`
volume reachable before unlock.** Drivers keep their §16.2 home
(`/System/Drivers/`), so this is *not* the expedient "drivers on the FAT boot
partition" layering smell. Security holds without encrypting `/System`:
**every bundle is Ed25519-signed and verified against the kernel's embedded
trust anchor at load (§18.6)**, so a tampered read-only store is detected and
fails closed — encryption would add nothing the per-bundle signature does not
already give, and `/System` holds no secrets. The encrypted root keeps only
the secret-bearing user data (`/Users`, app/user installs, `/Storage`).

**Target on-disk layout (the §16/§11 image; `tools/mkimage`):** three MBR
partitions — (1) FAT boot (firmware/kernel/`root.unlock`, unchanged);
(2) **`/System` — read-only `ARXFS`, unencrypted, signed-bundle store**;
(3) data root — encrypted `ARXFS` carrying `/Users`/`/Apps`/`/Storage` and
`/System/Security/Users`. The installer (§11) authors the same split; expert
mode may not collapse it.

**Boot sequencing (the §18 path, no ambient authority, fail closed §5.4):**
1. bootstrap-floor storage + bus bring-up (incl. the metal PCIe-RC + xHCI);
2. enumerate every device — **including the USB-HID keyboard behind the VL805
   hub — into the `tairix_abi::hwtree`** (metal USB→tree enumeration, the
   piece the deleted scaffold did imperatively);
3. mount the read-only `/System` volume and **autoload its signed
   `/System/Drivers/` store against the discovered tree** (`devmgr` match →
   signed gate → user-space spawn), bringing the keyboard up in user space;
4. unlock the data root and install the users database. The bootstrap tries
   the **blank** passphrase silently first, so the installer image unlocks
   with **no prompt** at all (§11); only a non-blank passphrase (debug
   `root`, or a production operator-chosen one) draws the `Root passphrase:`
   prompt (now keyboard-served on HDMI).

**Staged increments (each one fully-gated; host/`-M virt`-verifiable unless
marked metal).** The in-kernel `keyboard_service`/`usb_keyboard.rs` scaffold
stays the metal driver and stays wired throughout, so the working metal
keyboard never regresses (§2.17), until the final flip:
- **B1 — three-partition layout + read-only `/System` mount. DONE (host +
  `-M virt`).** `lib/partition` carries a `ARXFSSystem` role (MBR type byte
  `0x7e`, GPT GUID `TYPE_GUID_ARXFS_SYSTEM`). `ARXFS::open_read_only` mounts
  a volume read-only and every mutator fails closed (`commit` backstop +
  early `deny_if_read_only` guards, §5.4). The `/System` volume is a `ARXFS`
  volume keyed by the non-secret well-known `tairix_drv_fs_arxfs::
  SYSTEM_VOLUME_KEY` (effectively unencrypted; integrity rests on the
  per-bundle signatures, §18.6). `tools/mkimage::rootfs::build_system_partition`
  lays the §16.2 skeleton at the volume root and `build_rpi_image` emits the
  three MBR partitions (boot @2048 / `/System` @133120 / encrypted root). The
  kernel discovers + mounts `/System` read-only over a `lib/partition` window
  in `root_mount::autoload_system_drivers`, auditing `SYSTEM_VOLUME_MOUNTED`
  (4140) / `SYSTEM_VOLUME_UNAVAILABLE` (4141). The `encrypted_root_image`
  `-M virt` fixture authors the split (the autoload driver bundles it plants
  are built and signed by the `image_drivers` pipeline). The installer
  (§11) is a Stage-8 placeholder; the split author is `tools/mkimage`.
- **B2 — relocate the autoload store to the `/System` volume + run it
  pre-unlock. DONE (host + `-M virt`).** The aarch64 unlock kthread now calls
  `root_mount::autoload_system_drivers(&mut blk, &mut AutoloadHook, audit)`
  **once, before** `unlock_root_disk_interactively`: it mounts the read-only
  `/System` volume and runs the `AutoloadHook` against it, so the keyboard
  driver is spawned in user space before the passphrase prompt
  (keyboard-up-before-unlock). The encrypted-root post-mount hook is gone —
  `unlock_root_and_load_users`/`mount_root_disk_and_load_users`/
  `unlock_root_disk_interactively` no longer take a hook and `NoMountedRootHook`
  is deleted (§2.14). The driver store is addressed **relative to the scanned
  volume's root**: `enumerate_driver_store`/`DriverImageReader::read_image` take
  an explicit `store_root`, and the `/System` volume (whose own root *is*
  `/System`) is scanned at the volume-relative `tairix_kernel_core::
  SYSTEM_VOLUME_STORE_PATH` (`/Drivers`), the §16.2 `/System/Drivers/` store.
  The fixtures plant the signed `virtio_kbd` bundle into the `/System` volume's
  `Drivers/` store (shared `tairix_test_arxfs_image::plant_nested_file`; the
  encrypted root carries no drivers, §2.14), which sizes itself to what it
  holds (`tairix_syshelp::build_system_volume`). `autoload_input_qemu_aarch64`
  proves the full discover→signed
  gate→spawn→`key_inject` path runs pre-unlock (PASS on
  `AuditEvent::InputDelivered` 4050).
- **B3 — floor USB→`hwtree` enumeration. DONE (host + metal).** Design A
  (operator-approved): the bootstrap-floor USB bring-up
  **owns** xHCI enumeration and emits the discovered HID-keyboard node into
  the boot hardware tree, so the §18 discovery path sees the keyboard like
  every other device (`AGENTS.md` §18.2). The controller is brought up
  **once**, on the boot CPU at the init seam:
  `keyboard_service::bring_up_keyboard_into_tree(ctx)` runs the VL805 chain
  (the former kthread bring-up, unchanged) and returns the
  `UsbDevice::describe_device` `HwNode` plus the live keyboard wrapped in a
  one-shot-exclusive-owner `SendKeyboard` (`unsafe impl Send`, §2.10);
  `init_spawn` attaches the node to the discovered tree via the host-tested
  `unlock_service::augment_boot_tree` (the pure `extended_tree` core, §2.2)
  **before** the unlock kthread reads `take_boot().tree`, then
  `keyboard_service::spawn_pump(ctx, keyboard)` runs the report pump only
  (no second bring-up, §2.16). The in-kernel pump stays the live keyboard
  driver (§2.17) and `devmgr` leaves the node **unbound** — the metal
  `/System/Drivers/` store carries no `usb_kbd` bundle until the B5 flip
  (§18.4). The path is inert on `-M virt`/host (it only fires when a
  `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` bridge is discovered), so the QEMU matrix is
  unaffected; the live VL805 enumeration into the tree has no Pi-board QEMU
  vertical (§0.4) and is metal-gated. Host-proven: `extended_tree` order
  test + the engine's existing `bring_up`/`describe_device` suite; the
  freestanding aarch64 kernel builds clean. **Metal-confirmed (§0.9):** the
  Pi 4 UART log shows the keyboard brought up once at the init seam
  (`4129` first report drained / `4131` heartbeat) and `devmgr` `13002`
  *unbound* records for the enumerated HID node (matched against the store,
  no bundle yet) — the node reached the autoload tree without a second
  bring-up, and a typed keystroke reaches the prompt.
- **B4 — live EMMC2 root bring-up. DONE (host + metal).** The aarch64
  root-unlock kthread now dispatches
  on which floor block driver `root_storage` bound: `virtio_blk_unlock` (the
  proven `-M virt` / x86_64 path, device-IRQ + DMA) or the `emmc2_unlock`
  arm. That arm admits `tairix-drv-storage-emmc2` through the signed §8 load
  gate, resolves the matched node's **sole register window**
  (`tairix_abi::driver::sole_register_window` — never a board constant, §18.1
  / §2.20), maps it under `CAP_MMIO_MAP` through `Emmc2Host` + the shared
  `KernelMmioMapper`, binds the controller's GIC SPI, carves the ADMA2 staging
  inside the node's DMA window (`Emmc2DmaHost`, `CAP_MEM_DMA`), lends the
  bring-up the firmware's EMMC2 clock and SD supplies (P8), opens the card,
  and feeds the `Block` to the **shared** `finish_unlock` tail (mount + read-only
  `/System` autoload + interactive unlock) virtio-blk also feeds (§2.2). The
  fail-closed EMMC2 stub at `spawn_if_present` (`root unbound` for any
  non-virtio binding) is deleted (§2.14); only a genuinely unknown floor
  driver now fails closed. Host-proven at the driver level (`emmc2`
  `MockSdhci` read/write + `wiring`/`BIND_KEYS` suites; `sole_register_window`
  in `lib/abi`; the freestanding aarch64 kernel builds + clippy clean). No
  `lib/abi`/C-header change. **Metal status — DONE (metal-confirmed).** On a
  real Pi 4 the root-unlock kthread brings the SD card up over programmed
  I/O, mounts the read-only `/System` volume (`SYSTEM_VOLUME_MOUNTED` 4140),
  and unlocks + mounts the encrypted root (`4133` → users db `4040`
  `records=1` → `ROOT_UNLOCK_INSTALLED` 4136 → `4139` login can
  authenticate). Two SD bring-up defects found via the `stage=` field were
  fixed to get there; they are the load-bearing facts of the driver's
  `bringup::power_and_clock` and `geometry_from_csd`: (1) the host-controller
  reset clears SD Bus Power, so bring-up powers the card rail (3.3 V via
  `CONTROL0`, Linux's `0x0F`) before clocking; (2) the SDHCI controller right-aligns the
  CRC-stripped R2 response, so `CSD_STRUCTURE` is read at `RESP3[23:22]`
  (`(resp[3] >> 22) & 0x3`, consistent with `C_SIZE` at `RESP1[29:8]`) and
  `MockSdhci` mirrors that layout. Both regression-tested
  (`a_stalled_or_unpowered_controller_fails_closed_at_the_first_command`,
  `structure_bits_above_the_field_are_not_read_as_v2`); the `EventId(4139)`
  failure line carries `stage=` + `error=` for any future stall. Metal
  acceptance also surfaced — and this increment fixed — two login defects
  that were masking the unlocked root (see P11 for the mechanism): (1)
  `login` read the users database **once** at startup, but design B spawns
  it before the unlock, so it cached the pre-unlock answer and refused
  `root`/`root` forever; and (2) `login` printed its `Username:` prompt
  immediately, on the **same** console the unlock kthread was prompting
  `Root passphrase:` on, so the two prompts drew over each other. Both are
  fixed by the `LateUsersDb` three-state machine + `tairix_login::supervise`
  (see P11): while the unlock is pending `users_db_read` returns
  `WouldBlock`, so `login` waits without prompting; once it resolves the
  installed database is picked up (or the deny-all prompt runs).
- **B5 (= 5e / D5d) — the flip — DONE (whole gate green).** The image now
  installs the signed bus bundles and the USB class drivers into
  `/System/Drivers/` through `tools/xtask` `commands/image_drivers.rs` over the
  `tools/mkimage` `drivers` seam. The in-kernel keyboard scaffold
  (`keyboard_service.rs` + `usb_keyboard.rs`, the init-seam bring-up call, the
  boot PCIe/mailbox stash, and `unlock_service::augment_boot_tree`) is deleted
  (§2.14), and `driver_catalog::IN_KERNEL_DRIVERS` is the storage bootstrap
  floor only — virtio-blk + EMMC2 (§18.6); `pcie_brcm`/`bus_usb`/`usb_hid` are
  evicted from it and the kernel's deps/`build.rs`. The keyboard comes up
  entirely in user space: `FdtDiscovery` seeds the discovered
  `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` + VideoCore mailbox nodes, `devmgr` autoloads the
  recursive chain (pcie_brcm → emits VL805 fn → vl805 reloads firmware + emits
  `usb,xhci` → `xhci` enumerates → `usb_hid` serves the keyboard), and
  `autoload_caps` carries
  `CAP_HW_EMIT` + `CAP_MAILBOX` so the bus bundles can emit nodes / call the
  mailbox (per-driver manifest∩ still binds, §5.2). The `hw_remove_node`
  syscall (no. 38) landed as the kernel-side mirror of `hw_emit_node`
  (ownership-checked subtree removal + generation bump); the device-manager
  unload reaction and the modular host-controller-driver / class-driver split
  it serves are staged in `plans/USB.md` (U1 — kernel driver-unload mechanism
  + devmgr unload-on-removal reaction — is the next increment). The live
  enumerate→emit→autoload chain is metal-gated (§0.9): no `-M virt` Pi-USB
  vertical exists (§0.4). **Metal acceptance:** top-down autoload from
  `/System` and a keystroke with the scaffold gone.
  - **DMA ordering (latest metal iteration).** With the EMMC2 store scan sped
    up (P8 4-bit/data-clock), the keyboard enumeration reached
    `EnumStage::SetConfiguration` then failed `id=4126 … completion_hex=1
    reject_hex=2` — a SUCCESS xHCI Transfer Event whose TRB pointer mismatched
    the awaited status TRB. Root cause: the device-shared DMA buffer is Normal
    **Non-Cacheable** (coherent) but the user-space driver issued **no memory
    barriers**, so on the non-I/O-coherent BCM2711 PCIe the controller could
    observe the doorbell before the published TRBs and the driver could read a
    fresh event cycle bit with a stale TRB pointer (a torn read). The gap was
    latent until the faster boot outran the controller's write-back window.
    Fix: new `lib/dma-barrier` crate (`dma_wmb`/`dma_rmb`, the user-space §1
    asm carve-out analogous to `lib/abi-trap`; aarch64 `dmb oshst`/`dmb oshld`,
    x86_64 `sfence`/`lfence`, riscv64 `fence iorw,iorw`, host/wasm32 no-op),
    wired into `lib/usb` at the controller-start + doorbell handoffs and the
    `poll_event` read (cycle bit first → `dma_rmb` → entry body). Host/CI-proven;
    the live keystroke is the metal acceptance item. Same-class gap in
    `lib/virtio`'s notify/used-ring path is the next consumer to adopt the
    barrier (§2.18 tracked follow-up).
  - **Console hand-off after a *successful* unlock (latest metal iteration).**
    With the keyboard delivering, the unlock succeeded but neither console
    could be typed into at `Username:` (keyboard *and* serial). Cause: the
    in-kernel unlock kthread owns console 0 for the passphrase prompt and
    must release it when the unlock resolves, but only the fail-closed
    branches called `release_console0_to_login` — the **success** path
    skipped it, so the console-0 gate stayed latched shut and the UART
    receive interrupt stayed masked (a successful unlock had no host/CI
    coverage: the `root_unlock_login` vertical drives the policy, not the
    kthread). Fix: the release is now coupled to the unlock *resolving* —
    `unlock_root_disk_interactively` takes an `on_resolved` callback fired
    exactly once on **every** outcome and internal return path (the kthread
    passes `release_console0_to_login`, which now also `console_wake`s so
    type-ahead buffered during the closed window is delivered). Regression
    `root_mount::the_console_is_released_on_every_unlock_outcome` (Installed
    + GaveUp) and the `root_unlock_login` vertical now asserts the release
    fired on success.
  - **`users_db_read` pending poll no longer logs as an error.** With login
    working end-to-end, the boot log still showed a `[ERROR] id=5004
    SYSCALL_HANDLER_REJECTED … users_db_read err=19` every ~5 s while the
    encrypted root unlocked: `WouldBlock` (the `abi-v1` "nothing yet, retry"
    signal `login` legitimately gets while pending) was audited as a genuine
    ERROR-level rejection. The dispatcher now records an audited handler's
    `WouldBlock` as the distinct, below-`Info` `SYSCALL_HANDLER_WOULD_BLOCK`
    (Debug, id 5005) instead of `SYSCALL_HANDLER_REJECTED` (id 5004) — it is
    not a rejection (every check passed, no security decision was taken), so a
    poll-while-pending cannot flood the log, while the record stays available
    for flood/DoS forensics when the level is lowered (`AGENTS.md` §2.1 /
    §19.4). Regressions in `kernel/syscall` (`audit`: id/level frozen;
    `table`: `WouldBlock` → 5005, a real rejection still → 5004).
    Likewise `NotFound` — the "no such object" answer a routine existence
    probe gets (`login` opening the optional `system.conf` store and the
    desktop bundle each round, both documented fail-closed-to-default) —
    is recorded as the below-`Info` `SYSCALL_HANDLER_NOT_FOUND` (Debug,
    id 5006), never 5004: a genuine authorisation refusal is
    `PermissionDenied`, which the secured VFS never masks as `NotFound`,
    so no security decision is hidden. Regressions in `kernel/syscall`
    (`audit`: id/level frozen; `table`: `NotFound` → 5006).
  - **The silent blank-passphrase probe no longer logs as an error.** With
    the `users_db_read` poll quietened, the one remaining boot `[ERROR]` was
    `id=4134 ROOT_MOUNT_REJECTED … cause=unlock_refused`: `root_mount`'s
    interactive unlock tries the **blank** passphrase silently first (so a
    fresh installer image boots with no prompt, §11), and on a non-blank
    image that probe fails `Mount(PermissionDenied)` on *every* boot — an
    expected fail-closed authentication non-match, but `reject()` logged it
    at ERROR. A wrong passphrase is now classified (`rejection_record`) as
    the below-`Info` `4142` `ROOT_UNLOCK_KEY_REJECTED` (Debug); `4134`
    `ROOT_MOUNT_REJECTED` (Error) is narrowed to *structural* refusals
    (unreadable/invalid descriptor, missing/malformed table or partition,
    non-arxfs volume, device fault). The interactive wrong-attempt audit
    stays `4137` `ROOT_UNLOCK_RETRY` (Warn) and give-up `4138` (Error). So
    neither the per-boot probe nor routine retries flood the log, while the
    record stays available for brute-force forensics when the level is
    lowered (`AGENTS.md` §2.1 / §19.4). Regressions in
    `kernel/tairix-kernel` `root_mount`: the two wrong-passphrase tests
    assert no `4134`, a new classifier test pins
    wrong-passphrase → (4142, Debug) and every structural refusal →
    (4134, Error).

**Done when:** on real hardware the desktop composites through `rpi_hvs`,
the taskbar renders, and a USB keyboard/mouse drives the WM; a recorded
demo (photo + UART log) is the acceptance artefact. Headless `-M raspi4b`
CI stays green throughout.

### P11 — Login on the consoles

Every *text* console (screen, UART) that reaches user mode sits at a
`login:` prompt; an authenticated user's **shell of choice** is started as
their session. The video console and the UART console are **separate
session contexts** (separate stream backings, separate login instances), so
two users — or the same user twice — can be logged in concurrently.

**Landed — the credential foundation (host-proven):**

- `lib/crypto`: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (`pbkdf2_sha256` / `pbkdf2_sha256_verify`,
  published vectors, `ct_eq` comparison) — the password derivation the user
  database stores.
- `lib/users` (`tairix-users`): the `/System/Security/Users` `users-v1`
  format — full §5.1 account identity (username, uid/gids, display name,
  home, shell of choice, `CAP_*` grant ceiling, `active`/`locked` state,
  salted PBKDF2 record at a bounded per-record cost), fail-closed bounded
  parser (64 KiB / 512-byte lines / 512 records, unique usernames + uids),
  exact-round-trip serialiser, and `authenticate` with one indistinguishable
  refusal + a dummy derivation at the database's highest cost for unknown /
  locked accounts (§19.1). Fuzz harness `fuzz_users` enrolled in
  `cargo xtask fuzz`. Docs: `docs/src/lib/users.md`.
- `userland/session/login::auth::UsersAuthenticator`: the production
  `Authenticator` seam over a parsed `UsersDb`; every refusal is the same
  `Errno::PermissionDenied`. Login's `Uid`/`Gid` now come from `lib/users`.
- `tools/mkimage` image profiles: `cargo xtask image --target aarch64-rpi
  [--profile debug|installer]` emits
  `images/tairix-aarch64-rpi-<profile>.img`. The **debug** image seeds
  `/System/Security/Users` with the `root`/`root` test account (per-build
  random salt, default cost, explicit admin cap ceiling); the **installer**
  image seeds none (the §11 installer authors it on first boot). Proven by
  mkimage host tests mounting the built root and authenticating.
- **Root-volume read path at boot** (former increment 1):
  `tairix_kernel_core::users::load_users_db` reads
  `/System/Security/Users` off the mounted root volume's
  `FilesystemRead` + `FilesystemSecurity` driver through the VFS's
  §5.3-checked per-inode delegation — the root mount carries the volume's
  driver (`MountTable::back_root`, exactly once), the file is bounded
  against the format's 64 KiB maximum *before* reading, and the bytes go
  through the fail-closed `tairix-users` parser. The read runs under the
  kernel bootstrap identity (`uid 0`, **no** capabilities — a
  capability-gated or unreadable record refuses, §5.1/§5.4); every
  outcome is audited (`USERS_DB_LOADED` 4040 / `USERS_DB_REJECTED` 4041)
  and any refusal leaves **no** database. Proven by kernel/core unit
  tests (every refusal), the `arxfs_image` users-root fixture round
  trip through the real driver, and the `users_db_qemu_aarch64` `-M
  virt` vertical (virtio-blk MMIO → arxfs mount → loader →
  authenticate). The Pi's metal root mount (P8/P9) and the
  volume-key hand-off to the loader on metal ride the P8/P9 metal
  items.
- **The login `Run` binary + the `users_db_read` delivery seam**
  (former increment 1): the login service ships at
  `/System/Services/login.app/Run` (`userland/session/login/src/run.rs`, a
  `tairix-rt` program) and PID 1 `init`'s `session` directive points at
  it. The kernel-held database is delivered through the new `abi-v1`
  syscall **`users_db_read`** (no. 19, gated on the new
  **`CAP_USERS_READ`** (21), audited): the kernel serves the exact
  `users-v1` text from the `kernel/core::users::UsersDbSource` seam
  (installed via `with_users_db`; fail-closed `NotImplemented` unwired /
  `NotFound` with no database / `BufferTooSmall` rather than truncate),
  and login re-parses it with the same fail-closed `tairix-users`
  parser. With no database (installer image, no root volume) login wires
  a deny-all authenticator — the prompt stays up and every attempt is
  refused (§5.4.5). Design B spawns `login` **before** the in-kernel unlock
  kthread mounts the encrypted root, and the kthread prompts for the
  passphrase on the **same** console, so the `users_db_read` seam is a
  **three-state** machine (`LateUsersDb`) and `tairix_login::supervise`
  acts on it **before every round**: while the unlock is still running the
  read returns `WouldBlock` and `login` *waits without prompting* (yielding
  the CPU) so the unlock owns the console and the two prompts never collide;
  a delivered database wires `UsersAuthenticator`; and once the unlock
  resolves with no database (installer image, or it gave up) the read
  returns `NotImplemented` and the fail-closed `DenyAll` prompt runs. The
  kernel pairs `LateUsersDb::resolve` with opening the console-0 input gate
  through one `release_console0_to_login` helper (§2.2), so a `login` parked
  on the pending read always makes progress. This fixes the two metal
  P8/B4 login failures (`root`/`root` refused after unlock; the premature
  `Username:` prompt). Regressions: kernel-core
  `the_late_users_db_is_pending_until_the_unlock_resolves` /
  `a_resolved_empty_late_users_db_fails_closed_not_implemented` /
  `an_installed_database_wins_over_a_later_resolve`, and login
  `login_waits_while_pending_then_authenticates_once_installed` /
  `an_absent_database_prompts_deny_all_without_waiting` /
  `the_users_database_is_reloaded_before_each_round`.
  The `SessionLauncher` spawns the authenticated
  record's **shell of choice** via `spawn`/`wait`; the embedded-program
  registry now carries **per-program capability grants + argument
  vectors** (`EmbeddedProgram.caps`/`.args`, all three arch producers —
  login holds the console pair + `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` + `CAP_USERS_READ`,
  the shell only the console pair). Proven by kernel/core +
  kernel/syscall + login unit tests and the reworked
  `spawn_session_qemu_{aarch64,x86_64}` verticals (init supervises
  login; the aarch64 vertical holds an ordered scripted dialogue over
  the runner's multi-step serial script — `root` → `Password: ` →
  refused password → `Login incorrect` → second `Username: ` → a
  513-byte over-bound line → fail-closed exit → reap → relaunch — and
  the runner fails the run if the guest exits before every scripted
  prompt appeared, so a login crashing per keystroke cannot pass on
  relaunch event counts alone).
  Login's **entire prompt/credential input path is allocation-free** —
  the userland heap's production `mem_map` producer is staged
  (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5b), so any allocation there would abort the
  process (the original per-keystroke `Vec::push` did exactly that on
  metal: every typed character killed login and `init`'s relaunch
  re-printed `Username: `). `tairix_login::Prompt` fills caller stack
  buffers (`INPUT_LINE_MAX` = 512), `Credentials` borrows `&str`, and
  `Login::run` zeroes the password buffer after every attempt; only the
  authenticate path (which parses a delivered database) still needs
  SP5b and the P8 root mount.
- **Beacon + bring-up debug removal** (former increment 2): the
  boot-progress beacons (`boot_aarch64`/`serial`/`video`) and the
  serial bring-up mirror in `kernel/arch/aarch64/src/serial.rs` are
  deleted. The **boot-log** path routes by build profile
  (`serial::ConsoleWriter`): a **release build** is video-first with the
  UART as the fallback (`AGENTS.md` §10), while a **debug build**
  (`cfg(debug_assertions)`) routes the whole log/debug stream to the
  **UART instead** — even while a login session owns the UART — so a
  serial capture of a development boot carries the full diagnostic
  stream while the screen stays clear for the user-facing session; with
  no UART discovered the bounded transmit drops the bytes and the
  screen is never the debug log's sink. Because the single freestanding
  kernel cannot read which image it was planted in, the routing is tied
  to the **image profile** by building the kernel in the matching Cargo
  profile (`tools/xtask` `kernel_build_profile`): `--profile debug`
  compiles a `dev` (`debug_assertions`-on) kernel that logs to the UART,
  `--profile installer` compiles a `--release` kernel that logs on
  screen. The earlier defect was building both images from one
  `--release` kernel, so `debug_assertions` was always off and the debug
  log never reached the UART.
- **Separate console contexts — LANDED** (former increment 1, minus
  echo). The video console and the UART are independent stream backings
  with their own login sessions:
  - `tairix_abi::DescriptorTable` records, per standard descriptor, the
    installed-console index backing it (`standard_on(console)`;
    `standard()` = console 0). `spawn` (now 3-arg) takes a `console`
    selector — `CONSOLE_INHERIT` (all-ones sentinel) copies the
    caller's own table (login's shell stays on login's console), any
    other value names a validated installed-console index and fails
    closed with `NotFound` otherwise. New `abi-v1` syscall
    **`console_count`** (no. 20, `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE`, unaudited)
    reports the installed-list length. C view regenerated
    (`tairix_sys_spawn` 3-arg, `tairix_sys_console_count`,
    `TAIRIX_CONSOLE_INHERIT`).
  - kernel-core holds a `'static [ConsoleDevice]` list
    (`BootInfo::with_consoles` → `KernelSyscallHandlers::with_consoles`;
    empty fail-closed default). `stream_write`/`stream_read` resolve
    the descriptor's direction first, then its console index against
    the list (missing console → `NotImplemented`); the init pipeline
    wraps every listed read half in `BlockingConsoleRead`.
    `KernelSpawnCtx` carries the spawner-resolved table to admit.
  - aarch64 installs `[VideoConsole, UartConsole]` when the P7b
    framebuffer console is active, else `[UartConsole]`.
    `serial::write_console_bytes` is now UART-only (the UART console's
    write half, its own login); `VideoConsole` writes through
    `video::write_bytes` and reads from the **keyboard seam** — a
    directly attached USB-HID / PS/2 keyboard once the P10 input wiring
    lands; until then every poll reports "no input pending" and the
    reader parks at its prompt rather than borrowing the UART's bytes.
    x86_64 (COM1) and riscv64 (SBI) list single write-only consoles
    with fail-closed `NULL_CONSOLE_READ` read halves — behaviour
    unchanged.
  - PID 1 `init` supervises **one login per discovered console**
    (`userland/system/init/src/supervisor.rs`, host-tested over the
    `Sessions` seam): `console_count` → `spawn_at(session, console)`
    fan-out, wait-any reaping, relaunch on the exited session's own
    console within a per-console `SESSION_SPAWN_BUDGET`, exhaustion /
    spawn / wait failures and a zero-console system fail closed
    (`EXIT_NO_CONSOLES` 74). The bootstrap slot table is a fixed
    8-entry stack array until the userland heap (SP5b) lets it size
    from the count.
  - Proven by kernel-core unit tests (per-descriptor console routing
    both directions, console_count, spawn explicit/invalid/inherit
    attachment), lib/rt + abi-sys marshalling tests, and the init
    supervisor host tests; the `-M virt` verticals ride the unchanged
    single-UART list.
- **Stream-layer echo + echo control — LANDED.** Terminal local echo is
  the kernel's read line-discipline behaviour, not a per-program job
  (§2.2): `ConsoleDevice` carries a per-console `echo` flag (default
  on), and `stream_read` writes the bytes it consumes back to the same
  console's write half, rendering a bare CR/LF as CR-LF, so a typed
  username is visible. The **discipline-control contract** is the
  `abi-v1` syscall **`stream_input_mode`** (no. 21, `CAP_CONSOLE_READ`,
  unaudited): `stream_input_mode(fd, mode)` selects the resolved input
  console's discipline — cooked (echo on, the default), secret (echo
  off, activity indicator on — a password read), or raw (echo off,
  nothing drawn — a full-screen program's read); the reserved `0` and
  unknown modes fail closed. `login` selects secret around the password
  read and restores cooked after, so a credential is never rendered, and
  fails the read closed if the mode cannot be selected (`AGENTS.md`
  §5.4); `top`/`man` select raw so neither echo nor marker paints over
  their displays. First-party wrapper `tairix_rt::set_input_mode`; C
  stub `tairix_sys_stream_input_mode` (header regenerated). Proven by
  kernel-core tests (echo to the write half + CR/LF translation, secret
  and raw suppressing echo, fail-closed on the reserved/unknown mode and
  a non-read fd), console.rs `echo_bytes` unit tests, and lib/rt +
  abi-sys marshalling tests.
- **Read-line editing (erase rub-out) — LANDED.** The read line
  discipline edits the line, not just echoes it. The erase vocabulary is
  one shared `lib/vt` definition (`control::is_line_erase` — Backspace
  `BS` or Delete `DEL` — plus the Delete key's `CSI 3 ~` escape sequence
  via the `line::EraseSeq` recogniser held across split reads, and the
  `ERASE_ECHO` `BS SP BS` rub-out, §2.2), so the kernel echo and the
  reader's buffer can never disagree on what erased. Kernel **echo** half
  (`ConsoleDevice::echo_bytes`): an erase rubs out the previous character
  instead of painting stray control glyphs, bounded by a per-console line
  state (`EchoLine` — column + held sequence prefix, reset on CR/LF and on
  every `set_input_mode` change) so an erase at the start of the input line
  never walks back over the prompt; the state persists across the many
  per-byte `stream_read` drains one logical input line spans. Reader
  **buffer** half (`tairix_vt::line::LineEditor`, a host-tested
  allocation-free editor shared by the root-unlock passphrase prompt,
  login's prompt reads, and the shell REPL's line reader): CR/LF completes
  the line, an erase pops the last byte (zeroed on removal, §4) and is
  never stored, any other byte appends or fails closed `TooLong`;
  `login::run::read_line_raw` drives it. Proven by the `lib/vt` control +
  `line` tests and the `console.rs` erase tests (rub-out, BS-as-erase,
  Delete-sequence rub-out incl. split reads, no-op at line start,
  persistence across calls, CR/LF reset, `set_input_mode` reset). Docs:
  `docs/src/architecture/syscalls.md`, `docs/src/lib/vt.md`,
  `docs/src/userland/login.md`.
- **Secret-entry feedback (`[input active...]`) — LANDED.** Every
  echo-suppressed (password) prompt shows the shared activity marker: the
  pure `tairix_vt::secret::SecretIndicator` state machine (show on first
  typed character, dots cycling `.`/`..`/`...` on a one-second cadence).
  The animation is bounded: it runs for at least three seconds
  (`SECRET_ANIMATE_NS`) after the most recent keystroke and then freezes
  (marker stays, dots stop), a later keystroke restarts it; on Enter the
  marker is replaced in place with `[input complete]`, and erasing back to
  empty (or aborting the read) removes an in-progress marker while a
  completed one is left on screen. Hosted per console as the kernel
  `SecretFeedback` (`kernel/core` console). `set_input_mode(Secret)` arms
  it (login's password read — the raw mode never does, so a full-screen
  program's keystrokes draw nothing), the root-unlock kthread arms its
  own instance
  around the passphrase prompt, and the blocking console readers
  (`BlockingConsoleRead`, `KthreadConsoleRead`) feed it the consumed bytes
  and drive its one-shot animation deadline through the `CONSOLE_WAITQ`
  timed park (`rearm_timed_wakeup` / `wait_now_ns`) — armed only while the
  dots are moving, so a prompt with nothing typed (and a frozen marker)
  takes no timer wake-ups (tickless, §17.1). Only the typed-character
  *count* is tracked; no secret byte is stored or rendered. The aarch64
  framebuffer text console honours Backspace (cursor back one column, no
  glyph), so the marker's rub-outs and dot redraws render correctly on the
  HDMI console, not as `?` fallback glyphs. Proven by `tairix_vt::secret`
  tests and the `console.rs` feedback tests (inert until armed, marker
  show, freeze after the window, resume/extend on typing, `[input
  complete]` on Enter, erase/abort removal, secret-mode arm / cooked- and
  raw-mode disarm) plus the `video.rs` backspace tests.
- **Keyboard input for the video console — kernel-side delivery seam
  LANDED.** The video console's read half is now a kernel-side type-ahead
  queue a keyboard-input driver feeds, not the inert `Ok(0)` poll a
  display-with-no-keyboard returned. New `abi-v1` syscall
  **`console_input`** (no. 22, gated on new **`CAP_INPUT_INJECT`** (22),
  unaudited): a driver that has decoded a directly attached keyboard
  pushes the decoded console bytes into a target installed-console index;
  the kernel copies them in (capability- and bounds-checked, §5.4),
  enqueues them on that console's `tairix_kernel_core::ConsoleInputQueue`
  (a bounded type-ahead ring that is both the console's `ConsoleRead`
  half — drained by a video-login `stream_read`, waking a reader parked
  in `BlockingConsoleRead` — and its `ConsoleInput` half), and zeroes
  each byte as the consumer drains it (a typed password transits it,
  §4 / §23.1). `ConsoleDevice` gained an `input` half (default
  `NULL_CONSOLE_INPUT`, fail-closed; preserved across the init
  `BlockingConsoleRead` rebuild); aarch64's `VIDEO_ONLY_CONSOLES[0]`
  is backed by the shared `VIDEO_KEYBOARD` queue, so the
  video login takes input only from its own keyboard, never the serial
  line (with a display active the UART is not installed as a console at
  all). First-party wrapper `tairix_rt::console_input`; C stub
  `tairix_sys_console_input` (header regenerated). Proven by kernel-core
  queue unit tests (FIFO drain, short read, ring wrap, overflow short
  push) + the `console_input` handler tests (push→read round trip;
  fail-closed for an unknown console and for a non-injectable UART
  console) + lib/rt / abi-sys marshalling tests.
- **Keyboard input for the video console — host-side producer LANDED.**
  The producer that turns decoded key events into the bytes
  `console_input` injects is now host-proven. The shared terminal key
  map is the new `lib/keymap` crate (`tairix-keymap`): `encode_key(Key,
  Modifiers, &mut [u8])` writes the console (tty) bytes one key press
  sends — a printable char (UTF-8, with the `Ctrl` C0-control and `Alt`
  meta-prefix arithmetic), `Enter`→CR, `Backspace`→DEL, `Tab`, `Escape`,
  the arrows (`ESC [ A`..`D`), and the editing/nav/function keys via the
  canonical `lib/vt` `SS3`/`CSI … ~` tables (no second escape definition,
  §2.2). It is `no_std`, allocation-free (writes a caller buffer, so it
  works before the SP5b userland heap), and fail-closed (`MAX_KEY_BYTES`
  bounds it; an unmappable key emits nothing). `drivers/input/usb_hid`
  gained a `console` module: the US HID-usage→`tairix_input::Key` table
  (letters/digits/shifted symbols/named keys/keypad), a stateful
  `KeyboardConsole` tracking the modifier bits + caps/num lock, and
  `pump_once` — the driver loop that polls the keyboard, feeds each event
  through `KeyboardConsole::feed` + `encode_key`, and injects the bytes
  through a `ConsoleSink` (on metal a `console_input` call against the
  video console's index; host tests use a recording sink). The
  HID-usage→`Key` half is HID-specific (a `ps2` keyboard resolves
  scancode set 1 into the same vocabulary, reusing `lib/keymap`); the
  `Key`→bytes half is the one shared map (§2.2). Proven by 13 `lib/keymap`
  unit tests + 13 usb_hid `console` tests (layout, ctrl/alt, caps/num
  lock, named/arrow/function sequences, fail-closed cases, and the full
  `BootKeyboard`→keymap→sink "hi" chain). Docs:
  `docs/src/lib/keymap.md`, `docs/src/drivers/input.md`.

**Remaining (next increments, in order):**

1. **Keyboard input for the video console — VL805/xHCI metal delivery.**
   The kernel delivery seam (`console_input` + `ConsoleInputQueue`) and
   the host-side producer (`lib/keymap` + the usb_hid `console` module
   above) are landed; what remains is the **metal** path that feeds the
   producer real reports: the USB-HID-over-xHCI **VL805** wiring (the P10
   alternative track) so the driver's `pump_once` loop runs against a
   real keyboard and injects into the video console. QEMU models no Pi
   USB, so this is a metal checklist (`AGENTS.md` §20 / §0.4; the UART
   stays its own session).
2. **Configurable log policy** — the log output/direction (which
   consoles/sinks receive log lines), rotation, and on-storage age
   limits become administrator-settable configuration under
   `/System/Settings` (§16.2), replacing the compiled-in routing;
   requires the persistent `/System/Logs` store (§19.4) before rotation
   and age limits are meaningful. The debug-build dual echo stays a
   debug-only exception.
3. **Login over a real database in production.** The passphrase-derived
   root-unlock **primitive is landed**: `drivers/filesystem/arxfs`'s
   `unlock` module (`UnlockDescriptor` — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 over a
   per-volume random salt + bounded iteration count, fail-closed
   encode/decode, `derive_volume_key`) turns an operator passphrase into
   the volume's `VolumeKey` (`AGENTS.md` §11). It is the LUKS-style
   indirection above the always-encrypted volume; the plaintext
   descriptor rides beside the volume (the FAT boot partition on a Pi
   image). A wrong passphrase derives the wrong key and `ARXFS::open`
   refuses it (`PermissionDenied`) — no separate oracle. Host-proven:
   the `unlock` unit tests plus an end-to-end arxfs test that formats a
   volume under a passphrase-derived key and re-mounts it (wrong
   passphrase refused). Docs: `docs/src/filesystem/arxfs-spec.md` §7
   (incl. the §19.9 TPM/secure-boot future hand-off, which seals the key
   to a measured boot and falls back to the passphrase).

   **Image authoring is landed** (`tools/mkimage`): `build_rpi_image`
   provisions a per-volume `UnlockDescriptor` (random salt +
   `UNLOCK_DEFAULT_ITERATIONS`) and derives the volume key from the
   profile's `passphrase_for` — `INSTALLER_PASSPHRASE` (**blank**, the
   installer image re-provisioned at install time) or `DEBUG_PASSPHRASE`
   (`root`, the never-shipped debug image). The passphrase is not a
   `build_rpi_image` argument: deriving it from the profile makes it
   impossible to provision an image under a passphrase that disagrees with
   the prompt (§2.2). It provisions the encrypted root under the derived
   key and plants the plaintext descriptor on the FAT boot partition as
   `root.unlock` (`fatboot::ROOT_UNLOCK_NAME`). The boot path tries the
   blank passphrase silently, so the installer unlocks with no prompt; the
   derived key is also emitted to `.rootkey` for host mounting and is
   re-derivable from `root.unlock` + the profile passphrase. Host-proven by
   the mkimage tests (the on-FAT descriptor re-derives the exact key per
   profile; a wrong passphrase is refused with no separate oracle, §5.4).
   Docs: `docs/src/install/raspberry_pi.md`.

   **Still staged** (each its own increment; the chain end to end is
   gated on these):
   - **Installer-authored production root.** The §11 installer first-boot
     flow provisions the *user's* encrypted root under their **chosen**
     passphrase and writes its descriptor — a real, operator-set
     passphrase, never the blank `mkimage` default. (The blank-passphrase
     `mkimage` images above are the development/first-boot artefacts only.)
   - **Boot mount.** The production boot reads the descriptor from the
     boot partition, prompts for the passphrase on the console, derives
     the key, mounts the discovered root volume (EMMC2 on metal /
     virtio-blk on `virt`), runs the kernel-side read, and installs the
     held text into the production dispatch hook.
     - **Kernel-neutral install seam — LANDED.** The architecture-neutral
       half of this — the §17.4 boundary between the install *policy* and
       the board storage bring-up that *produces* the mounted driver — is
       wired: `tairix_kernel_core::users::load_users_db_source` reads
       `/System/Security/Users` off a mounted root FS driver (sharing the
       §5.3-checked read, the fail-closed parse, and the `USERS_DB_*`
       audit with `load_users_db`, §2.2) and returns a
       `HeldUsersDbSource` owning the canonical `users-v1` text (zeroed on
       drop §4, redacted `Debug`). A boot path `Box::leak`s the holder and
       installs it through the new `BootInfo::with_users_db`;
       `kernel_main` threads it into the `KernelDispatchHook` so
       `users_db_read` serves it. The default stays the fail-closed
       `NULL_USERS_DB` (login refuses every attempt) until a boot path
       calls `with_users_db`. Host-proven (kernel/core: 3
       `load_users_db_source` cases + the `BootInfo::with_users_db`
       builder). No `lib/abi`/C-header change (`BootInfo` is a kernel/core
       handover type, not FFI).
     - **Chunk A — the arch-neutral unlock + mount + load composition —
       LANDED (host-proven).** `tairix_kernel::root_mount::unlock_root_and_load_users`
       (`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/root_mount.rs`) is the one composition —
       in the `Layer::Tooling` bin crate, the only layer permitted to name
       both the `arxfs` driver and `kernel/core` (§17.4) — that turns the
       three artefacts a boot path recovers off storage into the served
       `users-v1` database: the plaintext `root.unlock` descriptor, the
       typed passphrase, and the encrypted root `Block` device. It decodes
       the descriptor fail-closed (`UnlockDescriptor::decode`, §5.4.3),
       derives the volume key from the passphrase (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256) in a
       `Zeroizing` wrapper (§4 — wiped on drop, the audited `zeroize` crate,
       no hand-rolled primitive), mounts the encrypted root (`ARXFS::open`
       — a wrong passphrase refused with `PermissionDenied`, no plaintext
       fallback, no separate oracle, §4 / §5.4), then runs
       `load_users_db_source`. Every refusal is audited (`4133`
       `ROOT_MOUNT_UNLOCKED` / `4134` `ROOT_MOUNT_REJECTED`; no secret ever
       logged, §19.4) and yields no database (§5.4.5). Host-proven by 4
       tests (the correct passphrase unlocks the volume and the served text
       parses + authenticates the planted `root`/`root`; a wrong passphrase,
       a tampered descriptor, and a non-arxfs volume each refused
       fail-closed). The shared `tairix_test_arxfs_image` fixture gained
       `build_users_root_image_with_key` + `VecBlock::from_bytes` so the
       test authors a real volume under a passphrase-derived key through the
       one on-disk-layout source of truth (§2.2). No `lib/abi`/C-header
       change.
     - **Chunk B-1 — the FAT `root.unlock` reader — LANDED (host-proven).**
       `tairix_kernel::root_mount::read_root_unlock_descriptor` reads the
       plaintext `root.unlock` key-derivation descriptor off the FAT boot
       partition through the **same** real FAT32 driver `tools/mkimage`
       authored it with — one on-disk definition for writer and reader
       (§2.2). The file name is now the shared
       `tairix_drv_fs_arxfs::ROOT_UNLOCK_NAME` constant (hoisted from
       `tools/mkimage::fatboot`, which re-exports it; §2.2 / §2.14). The
       descriptor is a fixed-length record, so the read is strictly bounded
       and fail-closed (§5.4 / §24.4): the entry's size is checked to be
       **exactly** `UNLOCK_DESCRIPTOR_LEN` *before* a byte is read (both a
       truncated and an over-long file refused), and the bytes are still
       re-validated by `UnlockDescriptor::decode` inside
       `unlock_root_and_load_users` (§5.4.3). Host-proven by 6 reader tests
       (read-back + decode, end-to-end feed into `unlock_root_and_load_users`,
       missing → `NotFound`, truncated/over-long → `OutOfRange`, unformatted
       partition refused) over a FAT volume authored through the real FAT32
       driver. No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **Chunk B-2 boot-path entry composition — LANDED (host-proven).**
       `tairix_kernel::root_mount::mount_root_and_load_users` is the single
       boot-path entry that threads Chunk B-1 into Chunk A: given the two
       brought-up `Block` devices (FAT boot partition + encrypted root) and
       the typed passphrase it reads the `root.unlock` descriptor
       (`read_root_unlock_descriptor`) and, on success, calls
       `unlock_root_and_load_users` — so the boot path neither re-threads the
       descriptor buffer nor reconciles two error taxonomies itself (§2.2). A
       descriptor that cannot be read off the boot partition is audited
       (`4134`) and returned as the new `RootMountError::DescriptorRead`
       (cause `descriptor_unreadable`); the encrypted root is never touched
       and no database is served (§2.9 / §5.4.5). Host-proven by 3 tests
       (end-to-end success authenticating the planted `root`/`root`; a
       missing descriptor refused with no unlock; a wrong passphrase refused
       fail-closed). No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **Chunk B-2 single-disk partition split — LANDED (host-proven).**
       `tairix_kernel::root_mount::mount_root_disk_and_load_users` is the
       entry for the common case: **one** whole-disk `Block` device. It
       parses the partition table through the shared, scheme-neutral
       `lib/partition` layer — MBR encode (the image author) + fail-closed
       MBR/GPT parse (the boot reader), the one on-disk definition
       `tools/mkimage` writes (§2.2), so it reads a Pi MBR card **and** a
       UEFI x86_64 GPT disk with no board `cfg` (§2.20). It locates the FAT
       boot and `ARXFS` root partitions **by role** (not by index), opens a
       bounds-checked `PartitionBlock` window onto each **in sequence** (one
       device, two windows, via the new `impl Block for &mut B` forwarding in
       `lib/abi`), reads the descriptor off the boot window, then mounts the
       root window. A malformed/forged table, a missing FAT boot or `ARXFS`
       root partition, or an out-of-range extent is audited (`4134`) and
       returned (`RootMountError::PartitionTable`/`NoBootPartition`/
       `NoRootPartition`/`PartitionWindow`); no database is served (§2.9 /
       §5.4). Host-proven by 3 tests (whole-disk MBR split → unlock → load
       authenticating the planted account; no-table and no-root-partition
       refusals) plus the `lib/partition` MBR/GPT parse + fuzz suite. No
       `lib/abi` ABI change (the `&mut B` `Block` impl is a forwarding impl,
       not a new method — no C-header regen).
     - **Chunk B-2 root-storage bind gate — LANDED (host-proven).**
       `tairix_kernel::root_storage` resolves which **discovered**
       hardware-tree node carries the bootstrap root block device, and which
       floor block driver binds it, through the **same** shared `lib/devmatch`
       policy the user-space `devmgr` autoloader uses — applied against the
       in-kernel bootstrap-floor catalogue (`driver_catalog`, the
       `provides_root_block` entries: virtio-blk + EMMC2). The kernel binds a
       block driver because that driver's signed bind table matched a
       discovered node's identity, never because it *hunted* for a disk
       (§18.3 / §18.5 / §18.6). It is the storage analogue of the keyboard
       bind gate (`keyboard_service`): a streaming `RootBlockSelection`
       resolves each node off the discovery sink with no whole-tree buffer
       (§2.16). It is **resolution only** — it mounts nothing — so the
       metal-confirmed boot is unaffected (§2.17). Fail closed (§2.9):
       no block device leaves the root unbound (informational, §18.4); a
       directly-described device (EMMC2 `compatible`) binds straight from the
       tree while a bus-probed one (virtio-blk device id) binds only once the
       bus driver attaches the probed child (§18.2); more than one distinct
       block device fails closed as ambiguous (root disambiguation needs an
       explicit boot descriptor, not a guess). Wired into the aarch64 boot
       path (`aarch64::boot::audit_root_storage_binding`, post-MMU before the
       core hand-off) and audited `4135` `ROOT_STORAGE_AUTOLOAD`. Host-proven
       (8 `root_storage` tests + the `driver_catalog` block-flag test);
       aarch64 kernel builds freestanding. No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **Chunk B-2 late-bound users-db cell — LANDED (host-proven).**
       `tairix_kernel_core::LateUsersDb` (`kernel/core/src/users.rs`) is the
       set-once `UsersDbSource` the post-boot unlock step publishes the
       mounted database into. The encrypted root is unlocked only **after**
       the console keyboard is live (the operator types the passphrase, §11),
       which is past where `BootInfo::with_users_db` is consumed — so the
       dispatch hook holds a `&'static LateUsersDb` from boot and reads
       `text()` on every `users_db_read`, and the unlock step installs the
       loaded database into the same cell once it exists. It is a
       `OnceCell<HeldUsersDbSource>` that fails closed (`Errno::NotImplemented`,
       like `NULL_USERS_DB`) until `install` succeeds (§5.4.5), is **immutable
       after the first install** (set-once; a later install returns
       `UsersDbAlreadyInstalled`, so no post-unlock path can swap the live
       credential database, §5.4), zeroes the rejected duplicate's and its own
       credential bytes (§4), and exposes **no syscall surface** (`install` is
       internal kernel code, not an ABI method). Host-proven by 3 `users_tests`
       (fails-closed-until-installed; serves-installed-text + re-parse +
       authenticate; set-once-refuses-replacement). No `lib/abi`/C-header
       change.
     - **Chunk B-2 interactive unlock policy — LANDED (host-proven).**
       `tairix_kernel::root_mount::unlock_root_disk_interactively` is the
       device-independent prompt + retry + install policy the in-kernel
       unlock kthread runs once the board has brought up the root block
       device and the console keyboard is live. Generic over the `Block`
       disk and taking the console halves as the object-safe
       `tairix_kernel_core::{ConsoleWrite, ConsoleRead}` seams, it names no
       arch or device type (§17.4). Each attempt prompts
       `ARXFS passphrase:`, reads one line into a zeroized,
       fixed-length on-stack buffer
       (`MAX_PASSPHRASE_LEN`; the secret never reaches the heap, a log, or
       memory beyond the attempt, §4 / §19.4; Backspace edits, an over-long
       line is a refused attempt not a truncated secret, §5.4.3), and runs
       `mount_root_disk_and_load_users`. Success publishes the loaded
       database into the set-once `LateUsersDb` (`4136`) and collapses the
       prompt line in place to just the filesystem label `ARXFS` (CR + label
       + erase-to-end-of-line) followed by a blank line so the login
       `Username:` is separated; a wrong
       passphrase (`Mount(PermissionDenied)`) is audited (`4137`),
       rate-limited by a minimum three-second timed park
       (`unlock_service::park_for_ns`, injected as a `delay` seam so host
       tests pass a no-op; never a busy-wait, §2.1/§2.23), reported
       (`Incorrect passphrase`), and prompted **again — indefinitely**: the
       root holds the only user data and login is refused until it mounts, so
       there is nothing to advance to without the correct passphrase. Only a
       structural failure or a console read fault gives up (`4138`), leaving
       the cell empty so every login is refused until reboot (§2.9 / §5.4.5).
       Host-proven by `root_mount` tests over a mock console + the same
       MBR + encrypted-`ARXFS` disk fixture `tools/mkimage` writes (§2.2). No
       `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **Chunk B-2 `&'static LateUsersDb` dispatch-hook wiring — LANDED
       (whole gate green).** The shared set-once cell
       `tairix_kernel::root_mount::LATE_USERS_DB` is the one definition the
       dispatch hook reads and the unlock kthread installs into; the aarch64
       boot path hands it to the hook via `BootInfo::with_users_db`, so
       `users_db_read` reads that cell on every call. Until an install it
       fails every read closed, identical to the previous `NULL_USERS_DB`
       default, so login still refuses every attempt until a root is mounted
       (§5.4.5) and the metal-confirmed boot is unaffected (§2.17). No
       `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **Chunk B-2 root-mount->login QEMU vertical — LANDED (whole gate
       green, incl. both Pi images).** A new `-M virt`
       `tairix-test-root-unlock-login-qemu-aarch64` vertical reuses the
       virtio-blk-mmio bring-up, then drives the production
       `unlock_root_disk_interactively` over a planted **whole-disk**
       encrypted-root image (MBR + FAT boot carrying `root.unlock` + a
       passphrase-derived encrypted `ARXFS` root): it types the passphrase
       at the prompt over a scripted console, mounts the root, installs the
       database into a `LateUsersDb`, and proves the planted account
       authenticates while a wrong password is refused. The disk is the
       shared `tairix-test-encrypted-root-image` fixture (authored by the
       real in-tree FAT32/`ARXFS` drivers + `mbr::encode`), which the
       `root_mount` host tests also split, so the in-memory split tests and
       the live (emulated) board exercise one on-disk layout (§2.2). No
       `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **INCREMENT (1) — production aarch64 device-IRQ subsystem — LANDED
       (host-proven + `-M virt` vertical).** The prerequisite that lets a
       kthread block on a device interrupt is complete:
       `kernel/tairix-kernel::aarch64::gic_irq::GicIrqController` bridges the
       arch `GicController` to `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqController`,
       `Aarch64BinArch::irq_routing`/`install_irq_dispatch` wire the GICv2
       routing + the EL1-vector `set_device_irq_dispatch` seam into the
       kernel/core `irq` phase (additive, no SPI bound until INCREMENT (2), so
       the metal boot is unaffected, §2.17); `kernel/arch/aarch64::fdt::
       gic_device_intid` decodes a device node's `interrupts` triple into a
       GICv2 INTID (SPI=number+`MIN_SPI_INTID`, no board constant, §2.20); and
       `tairix_kernel_core::KthreadIrqWaiter` is the cooperative
       `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqWaiter` an in-kernel service kthread drives
       (yields via the `YieldHandle`, mirrors `SyscallIrqWaiter`). Proven by
       `tests/integration/irq_kthread_qemu_aarch64`: a discovered RTC SPI wakes
       a `spawn_kthread` service parked in `block_until_ready` under the live
       eevdf scheduler, with the post-fire mask-before-wake check. Host tests:
       `KthreadIrqWaiter` (5), `gic_device_intid`/`gic_intid_from_cells` (9).
       No `lib/abi`/C-header change.
     - **INCREMENT (2) — Chunk B-2 the live in-kernel unlock kthread —
       LANDED (host-proven + the whole `-M virt` QEMU matrix green, both Pi
       images built).** `kernel/tairix-kernel::unlock_service` admits an
       in-kernel root-unlock scheduler kthread at the aarch64 init seam (in
       `init_spawn`, right after the keyboard scaffold, before `admit_init`
       diverges) that brings the bootstrap virtio-blk root device up over the
       INCREMENT (1) device-IRQ path and runs the device-independent
       `unlock_root_disk_interactively` policy. What landed:
       - `unlock_service` (top-level module, host-tested on the CI host): the
         **arch-neutral, device-independent core every port shares** (§2.2 /
         §17.2 — it names no architecture). It holds the post-MMU boot stash
         `record_boot`/`take_boot` (`RootBlockBinding` + the firmware DTB
         pointer + the discovered `&[HwNode]`, filled by
         `boot::audit_root_storage_binding`), the **console-0 ownership gate**
         (`Console0Gate`/`CONSOLE0_GATE`/`GatedConsoleRead`) that resolves the
         two-readers-of-one-queue concurrency note (item 5: the primary
         console's `login` reads through a `GatedConsoleRead` that withholds
         input — kernel-core `BlockingConsoleRead` parks it — until the unlock
         kthread opens the gate, while the kthread reads the raw device; the
         gate opens on every completion/fail-closed path so `login` is never
         left latched out; wired into both aarch64 console lists
         `arch_wrapper`), and the shared, host-tested helpers a future
         x86_64 / riscv64 port reuses verbatim rather than copying: the
         `UNLOCK_SERVICE`/`UNLOCK_TASK` ids + `note`, the `service_caps`
         (`MMIO_MAP`+`MEM_DMA`+`DRV_LOAD`) / `loader_caps`
         (`DRV_LOAD`+`DRV_KERNEL`) builders, the cooperative
         `KthreadConsoleRead` passphrase reader, and the `AutoloadHook`
         `MountedRootHook` over the abstract `DriverProcessSpawn` seam (so it
         names no concrete producer).
       - `aarch64::root_unlock` (`#[cfg(freestanding)]`, in the aarch64 boot
         subtree beside `boot`/`init_spawn`): the **arch-specific bring-up
         only** — `spawn_if_present` + `run_unlock` (over the arch-neutral
         helpers above), the GIC/FDT `device_spi`, the `wfi_fallback_park`
         supplied to the shared `tairix_kernel_core::IrqParkWaiter`,
         and the throwaway-bookkeeping VBASE/`PageTablePool` constants —
         build the bring-up
         off the boot-discovered DTB — `virtio_mmio_bus_from_dtb` → `MmioMap` +
         `KernelMmioMapper` over a **throwaway bookkeeping** arch `AddressSpace`
         (a private `PageTablePool`; device access is via the boot identity map
         through `DirectPhysMap`, so the table is bookkeeping only, VBASEs far
         above the identity window) → `provision_virtio_mmio(2)` → SPI via
         `fdt::gic_device_intid` bound on the **core-published** `IrqTable`
         (`gic_irq::published_irq_table`) + `gic::route_spi` + initial rearm →
         `DmaPool` + `KernelVirtioHost` → signed §8 `drvhost::Host::load` gate
         → `VirtioBlk::open` → `unlock_root_disk_interactively`. EMMC2 (the Pi
         SD host) is the staged metal increment: an EMMC2 binding fails closed
         (gate opened, root unbound).
       - **Interrupt-driven boot + task-parking device wait (load-bearing).**
         The production aarch64 boot brings the GICv2 up for delivery and runs
         interrupt-driven: `gic_irq::install_device_irq_dispatch` (kernel-core
         `irq` phase) calls `gic::init()` (enable distributor + CPU interface;
         additive — no line delivers until a driver routes its own, §2.17).
         The unlock kthread binds the device SPI on the core-published
         `IrqTable`; the shared waiter (`tairix_kernel_core::IrqParkWaiter`)
         re-arms the line (`gic_irq::CompositeIrqController::rearm`; unmask is
         the arch op the kernel `IrqController` trait omits) and **parks the
         calling task off the run queue** (register on `IRQ_WAITQ` → re-check
         `IrqTable::ready_for` → park; woken by the ISR's `irq_wake`), so a
         steady-state filesystem wait from a syscall context never halts the
         CPU and the dispatch loop (and `pump_tx` console drain) keeps running
         for the whole device wait. A context that cannot be scheduler-parked
         (the boot kthread) takes `root_unlock::wfi_fallback_park` — the
         canonical race-free `exceptions::{mask_irq, wait_for_interrupt,
         enable_irq}` park (mask → re-check → `wfi` → unmask) — which starves
         nothing at boot because everything else is parked waiting on it.
         The consuming `block_until_ready` loop clears the per-line ready
         flag on every wake, so the wait re-parks instead of degenerating
         into a budget-bounded busy-poll.
         `KthreadConsoleRead` keeps the cooperative `CooperativeYield` for the
         IRQ-less, polled passphrase read.
       - **virtio-MMIO device-interrupt ACK (load-bearing).** `tairix_virtio::
         Transport` gained a default-no-op `ack_interrupt`; `MmioTransport`
         overrides it to read `InterruptStatus` and write `InterruptACK`
         (virtio 1.1 §4.2.2), and `virtio_blk::run_request` calls it after
         `poll_used`. Without it the device holds its line asserted after a
         completion, so the next re-arm re-delivers a stale edge and the
         driver mis-pairs back-to-back reads — the read corruption that blocked
         the live mount. The default no-op keeps MSI-X PCI / the mock
         unchanged (3 host tests).
       - **Unlock audit on the audit channel (§19.4).** The unlock service's
         mount / install / give-up decisions route through the boot audit sink:
         `InitSpawnCtx::static_audit()` (default `None`; production
         `KernelInitSpawner` returns the `'static` audit) is threaded through
         `spawn_if_present` → `run_unlock` → `note()` + the capability-derive,
         MMIO map, virtio host, signed load gate, and
         `unlock_root_disk_interactively` (fallback `SERIAL_SINK`).
       - `ConsoleRead` dropped its blanket `Sync` supertrait; `Sync` is now
         required at the shared-`'static` storage sites (`ConsoleDevice.read`,
         `BlockingConsoleRead`), so the single-kthread `!Sync` cooperative
         reader is admissible.
       - **Bootstrap-floor virtio-MMIO enumeration** (`root_storage::
         observe_virtio_mmio_block_devices`, driven from
         `boot::audit_root_storage_binding`): the raw `virtio,mmio` firmware
         node carries only its `compatible` string, which binds no block
         driver, so the boot path probes each slot's `DeviceID` through the
         MMIO bus driver (`virtio_mmio_bus_from_dtb`) and folds a *probed*
         `HwMatchKey::virtio(2)` child node (the genuine probed identity,
         §18.2/§18.5 — never fabricated) into the same `RootBlockSelection`.
         This is what makes the production `virt` boot actually bind its
         virtio-blk root and admit the unlock kthread; the Pi tree has no
         `virtio,mmio` node, so it is a no-op there and metal-neutral
         (§2.17). The reused `aarch64::root_unlock` device-id constant is
         deduped to the canonical
         `tairix_drv_storage_virtio_blk::VIRTIO_BLK_DEVICE_ID` (§2.2).
         Host-tested (7 `root_storage` cases over a fake `Bus`).
       - The **admission vertical** `tairix-test-root-unlock-admission-qemu-
         aarch64` boots the production pipeline (`boot_aarch64::boot`) on
         `-M virt` with the planted `tairix-test-encrypted-root-image`
         virtio-blk disk: the enumeration binds the root, `spawn_if_present`
         admits the kthread, and it brings the device up over the device-IRQ
         path, reads the typed passphrase, mounts the encrypted root, and
         installs the database. PASS keys on the
         `unlock_service::USERS_DB_INSTALLED_MESSAGE` (a shared `pub const`,
         §2.2) observed on the audit sink — the *kthread-admission* witness
         (distinct from `root_unlock_login`, which drives the policy directly).
         Whole `-M virt` QEMU matrix green. Driving the per-console `login` to
         authenticate end to end additionally needs the userland heap to parse
         the served DB (SP5b, below), so it is out of this vertical's scope; the
         DB content authenticating `root`/`root` is proven by
         `root_unlock_login`.
       - No `lib/abi`/C-header change (the enumeration adds a new trait-free
         seam; the device-IRQ + console wiring is internal).
       - **EMMC2 root bring-up — wired (host-tested at the driver level).**
         The unlock kthread dispatches on the bound floor block driver
         (`run_unlock` → `virtio_blk_unlock` / `emmc2_unlock`); the EMMC2
         arm maps the matched node's sole SDHCI register window under
         `CAP_MMIO_MAP` through a minimal in-kernel MMIO-only `Emmc2Host`,
         admits `tairix-drv-storage-emmc2` through the signed §8 gate, and
         feeds the opened `Block` to the shared `finish_unlock` tail
         virtio-blk also uses (§2.2). See design B's **B4** above.
       - **Remaining (metal-gated, §0.4 — `raspi4b` cannot model EMMC2):**
         (a) the §0.9 metal UART log of the EMMC2 `/System` + encrypted-root
         mount; (b) the §0.9 metal UART-typed-login acceptance.
   - **Login parse.** The userland `login` parses the served text, which
     needs the production `mem_map` producer (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5b).
   - The `-M virt` `tairix-test-root-unlock-login-qemu-aarch64` vertical
     proves the unlock + install + `root`/`root` authentication end to end
     over the passphrase path (landed, above); the live UART-typed login on
     the booted system rides the kthread flip + the §0.9 metal checkpoint.

**Done when:** a metal Pi 4 and the `virt` verticals sit at `login:` on
every text console, `root`/`root` logs in on a debug image and gets the
record's shell, a second login on the other console works concurrently,
an installer image refuses every login until the installer has authored
users, and no beacon/debug output remains in production boots.

### P12 — On-board gigabit Ethernet (GENET)

**Landed — the host-provable driver and the shipped bundle**
(`plans/NETWORK.md` N14): `drivers/network/genet` drives the BCM2711's
`brcm,bcm2711-genet-v5` UniMAC and its external BCM54213PE RGMII PHY,
serving the `netchan-v1` device-channel contract to `netstack` like any
other NIC. It is planted as a signed `/System/Drivers/network/genet/Run`
bundle by `build_image_driver_bundles`, so `devmgr` autoloads it against the
discovered node; the flashable image also ships a `network.conf` selecting
DHCPv4 + IPv6 SLAAC on it (`plans/DHCP.md` D5), so a booted board
self-configures with nothing for the operator to edit.

**On-metal run 1 found the document unplanted where its reader looks.** The
board autoloaded the driver, published its `netchan`, and `netstack` bound
the interface — then nothing: no `INTERFACE_CONFIG_APPLIED`, no
`DHCP_LEASE_ACQUIRED`. The shipped `network.conf` was written to the
encrypted root's `/System/Settings`, while the only reader — `devmgr`,
pre-unlock over the read-only `/System` store endpoint — resolves the
volume-relative path the ABI names, so the default was read by nothing and
the machine managed no interface. Both sides now derive that path from
`SystemConfigFile::volume_path` (`plans/DHCP.md` D5).

Reviewing the driver for what else stood between a bound interface and a
lease found a second, independent blocker: bring-up programmed **no receive
destination-address filter**, and the UniMAC drops every frame that matches
no enabled filter slot, so the NIC would have received nothing at all. It now
enables broadcast + its own unicast address before enabling the receiver, and
the stack programs the group addresses it needs into the remaining 15 slots
(`plans/NETWORK.md` N14, N14d), so IPv6 neighbour discovery reaches the NIC
too.

Every base, IRQ, DMA aperture, and even the MAC address is a discovered
value: the register window and both INTIDs come from the node's `reg` and
`interrupts`, the DMA reach from the parent `/scb` bus's `dma-ranges`, and
the link-layer address from the firmware-published
`mac-address` / `local-mac-address` binding — no `const PI_*` anywhere. Two
discovery defects were fixed on the way: the hardware tree emitted the raw
device-tree `interrupts` cell rather than the GICv2 INTID, and a
DMA-mastering node on a `dma-ranges` bus requested no DMA constraint.

**No QEMU form exists.** QEMU models no GENET (`-device help` carries no
such device) and its `raspi*` machines hand the kernel no device tree, so
this stage has no emulated vertical by construction (§0.4 — never fake a
passing vertical). The driver's coverage is its register-level model suite.

**Landed since — offloads (`plans/NETWORK.md` N18a).** The driver advertises
`RX_CSUM_VALIDATED | TX_CSUM_TCP | TX_CSUM_UDP | TX_SEGMENT_TCP`: the receive
checksum engine reports per descriptor (no receive status block, so the frame
layout is untouched), the transmit status block directs the transmit engine,
and the driver splits a segmentation super-frame itself because the silicon
has no segmentation engine. The split is device-independent arithmetic in
`lib/net::txoffload`, host-tested there and against the register model here.

**Remaining — the on-metal acceptance item.** Flash the emitted image to a
Pi 4B with a cable in the RJ45 socket and confirm, from the operator's UART
log: `devmgr` autoloads the bundle against the GENET node, `devmgr` logs
`NETWORK_IFCONFIG_DELIVERED` for `wan`, `netstack` logs `DRIVER_BOUND` then
`DHCP_LEASE_ACQUIRED`, the board answers a ping at its leased address from
another host on the LAN, and the address matches the MAC printed on the board
(so the firmware-published address was used, not an invented one). Then
unplug and re-plug the cable and confirm the link event re-resolves without a
driver restart.

**Done when:** the checklist above is recorded against a real Pi 4B.

### P13 — The legacy DMA engines

`drivers/dma/bcm2835` binds the discovered `brcm,bcm2835-dma` node, serves
its `dmaengine-v1` endpoint and ships as `/System/Drivers/dma/bcm2835/Run`.
It is host-proven against a register-level model of the engines
(`docs/src/drivers/dma.md`); QEMU runs no cyclic DREQ-paced chain, so the
rest is metal.

**Metal checklist**, run with SND8's first consumer:

1. The driver comes up serving channels `0x7f5` and declares the node
   quiesced; the firmware's channels 1 and 3 are never touched, and the
   firmware's own display and audio keep working.
2. A cyclic transfer to a peripheral FIFO raises one interrupt per period on
   its channel's line, including channels 7–10 on their shared lines.
3. A consumer killed mid-stream has its channel stopped and released, and
   the next instance of its driver opens the same line.

**Done when:** the checklist above is recorded against a real Pi 4B.

---

## 4. Cross-cutting requirements (apply to every stage)

- **Discovery, not constants.** Any new MMIO base lands as a discovered
  `hwtree` resource, never a fresh `const PI_*_BASE`. `cargo xtask
  cfg-check` must stay clean; the grandfather list stays empty.
- **Capabilities + audit.** Every new device handle (UART, GIC, mailbox,
  framebuffer, SD, USB) is reached through a capability the matched
  `hwtree` node requested; every match/load/skip is logged with a stable
  event id (§5.4 / §18.3).
- **Honest emulation gaps.** Where `raspi4b` cannot model a peripheral
  (HVS, real HDMI, real USB timing, the GENET MAC), say so in the stage and
  carry the metal checklist; never fake a passing vertical (§2.1 /
  `WIRING.md` §0.4).
- **`virt` stays green.** None of this regresses the QEMU `virt` board:
  the board difference is discovered data, so the same code serves both.

## 5. Definition of done (per stage, run over the whole project)

```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cargo fmt --all && cargo fmt --all --check
cargo xtask ci            # clippy -D warnings, deps-check, cfg-check, test matrix,
                          # docs-check, deny, c-header drift, proptest/fuzz --quick,
                          # model-check, spec-review, abi-check, and the image gate
                          # (both aarch64-rpi profiles built end-to-end)
cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5
tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20   # developer machine (that's us): max 20 s;
                                  # the unbounded 24 h soak is the CI host's job
```

The QEMU verticals are **not** in the host-only `cargo xtask ci` gate; run
the enrolled matrix separately — and add a `-M raspi4b` invocation path to
`tools/qemu/src/aarch64.rs` so the new board verticals run:

```
cargo xtask test --qemu
```

A single Pi-board QEMU bin can be iterated directly once the `raspi4b`
machine support lands in the runner:

```
cargo build -p <pkg> --target aarch64-unknown-none
cargo run -q -p tairix-qemu --bin tairix-qemu-run -- \
    --kernel target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/<bin> --arch aarch64 \
    --board raspi4b --timeout-secs 60
```

Stages that can only be proven on metal (P7–P10) additionally record a
hardware bring-up checklist + a UART-log / photo acceptance artefact under
the stage, since CI has no Pi attached.

## On-metal acceptance: receive-path cost (`plans/NETWORK.md` N17)

Two items need a live Pi 4 and cannot be settled in QEMU, which models no
GENET.

1. **The idle-CPU measurement.** The reported symptom was ~15% of a core
   consumed while idle on a LAN. N17a removes the interrupt storm that
   caused it (the driver never masked its DMA-done sources while the stack
   was woken, and the kernel re-arms the line at every park, so the
   condition re-latched immediately). Confirm on metal that an idle Pi 4 on
   a busy segment now costs approximately nothing, and that
   `stats:net/<iface>/rx.filtered` climbs while `rx.packets` does not — that
   is the pre-filter shedding foreign broadcast.
2. **The offload measurement.** The open question — whether the 64-byte
   receive status block can coexist with the `RBUF_ALIGN_2B` pad — turned
   out to be moot: the receive checksum offload does not need the status
   block, only `RBUF_CHK_CTRL = RBUF_RXCHK_EN` and bit 15 of the completed
   descriptor, so the receive-buffer layout is unchanged. Receive and
   transmit checksum offload and driver-side TCP segmentation are landed
   (`plans/NETWORK.md` N18a). What metal still owes is the *measurement*:
   confirm a bulk TCP transfer reaches gigabit line rate at a lower CPU
   cost than before, that `ss`/`sysinfo` show no rise in checksum errors
   or retransmissions, and that a peer on the LAN accepts every segment
   the driver split (a wrong per-segment checksum would show as loss, not
   as corruption).
