# WINTERSUN.md — the desktop RPG: world, rules, realm server, and client

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. WinterSun is a 3D isekai action-RPG with a
procedurally generated world, server-authoritative multiplayer, and a
self-balancing economy. This plan owns the game: what it simulates, what it
draws, how a client and a realm server speak, and where each piece lives.

These companion plans own the cross-cutting pieces the game is a consumer of,
because each has consumers beyond it and a single definition is the charter's
rule (§2.2, §6). The GPU and shader plans are no longer driven by this game —
they are an OS workstream in their own right, and the game is one demanding
consumer of them:

| Concern | Plan |
|---|---|
| The parametric figure, its rig, its clips, and the art-quality harness | `plans/FIGURE.md` |
| Durable, crash-safe, indexed record storage | `plans/RECDB.md` |
| The device-neutral GPU render and compute seam, and its backends | `plans/GPU.md` |
| Shader programs: the IR, the validator, and the sandboxed compiler | `plans/SHADER.md` |

Read first (§15.18): `AGENTS.md` §10 (asset tiers, DPI), §16.5 (bundles),
§17.3 (the optional-desktop edge), §19.5 (parser sandboxing), §24 and §26
(scalability and the operating-conditions floor), §27 (complete primitives),
§28 (interactive surfaces answer within a frame); `plans/SOUND.md` (the audio
stack this consumes — **not** re-derived here), `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`
(every control the UI composes), `plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md` (window furniture
and size states), `plans/DISPLAY.md` (the seat lease), `plans/APPWIN.md` (the
window channel), `plans/NETWORK.md` (the socket ABI), `plans/APPDATA.md` (per-app
settings), `plans/CINDER.md` (the in-tree procedural-creature precedent
`plans/FIGURE.md` generalises), `plans/ICONS.md` (the artwork pipeline),
`plans/APPS.md` (bundle, help, and command-app rules).

## Ledger

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| WS0 | This plan, `plans/FIGURE.md`, `plans/RECDB.md`, `plans/GPU.md`, the jump-sheet rows, the §3 map entries, the `PLAN.md` stage | done |
| WS1 | `Layer::UserGame` in `deps-check`, the `userland/games/` subtree, and `wintersun/net`: the wire vocabulary, framing, the authenticated session handshake, bounded decode, the fuzz target | done |
| WS2 | `wintersun/world`: the seed-pure chunked generator — uplift, hydrology, climate, biomes, roads, sites — and its cross-architecture determinism vertical | done |
| WS3 | `wintersun/rules`: the fixed-tick authoritative step, space and collision, stats, damage, status effects | done |
| WS4 | `wintersun/art`: material synthesis, the splat field, the decal and particle vocabulary, the WinterSun palette | done |
| WS5 | The client shell: window, the three size states, input, frame pacing, camera, terrain draw | done |
| WS6 | Figures on screen: presets, clips, the animation state machine, the locomotion join, and the art harness measuring every shipped preset | done |
| WS22 | The shared float maths made faster with every target still agreeing to the bit: the correctly rounded hardware square root and rounding, fdlibm's transcendentals, the `round` fix, exact axis headings | done |
| WS23 | The client vertical: the bundle launched by name on its reference scene, its window read back as it opened, fullscreen, restored and maximised, and held pixel for pixel to the host's drawing and to the session's witness of how each frame reached the display | done |
| WS24 | The same vertical on virtio-gpu, where the fullscreen frame must be promoted to a single layer | blocked: the live session presents through the layer path only after `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` Stages A–E (P9) |
| WS25 | Climate, geology and biomes from ice sheet to rainforest: the latitude span and its circulation belts, seasonality, rock provinces and soils, biomes apart from the ground they cover, a synthesised material for every ground, the parameter document on the wire, and `--seed` | done |
| WS32 | The world in 3D: a perspective view across the real relief, terrain uneven after its biome and mostly flattened where villagers settled, and every pass drawn in depth, built as the stages a GPU runs so `lib/gpu` accelerates it with no redesign | planned |
| WS33 | The camera the player positions: hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to swing the camera around the character and tilt it | planned |
| WS26 | Flora, rocks and clutter as objects: the object vocabulary and its identity, species per biome, forest stands, edges, glades and riparian belts, deadwood, rocks by geology, wild clutter, ground cover, and the district scale | planned |
| WS27 | Scenery drawn and solid: the `wintersun/scenery` art, the sprite cache, standing things sorted with figures, the canopy pass and its readability fade, ground cover drawn, and swept collision against static obstacles | planned |
| WS28 | Landforms: volcanoes and hotspot chains, islands and atolls, mesas, canyons and badlands, karst, sea cliffs and sheltered bays, glaciated valleys and fjords, and the realm feature index | planned |
| WS29 | Water and roads as curves: rivers, streams and brooks that wind unevenly and meander rather than run straight, floodplains, deltas, estuaries, falls, ponds, springs and oases; the road hierarchy over a looped network, with switchbacks, bridges, fords, ferries and causeways | planned |
| WS30 | Settlements and the land they farm: cities, towns, ports and castles; villages, hamlets, farmsteads and special sites; streets, plots, buildings, walls, gates and harbours; fields, pasture, orchards and paddies with their hedges, walls and fences | planned |
| WS31 | Caves, and the levels they need: positions that carry a level, and karst caves, lava tubes, sea caves and mines generated from the public seed, with their mouths on the surface | planned |
| WS7 | `Code/wintersun-store`: the schemas and the realm's single writer | planned |
| WS8 | `Code/wintersund` + `Code/wintersun-zone`: the gateway, zone shards, interest management, back-pressure, the thousand-player floor | planned |
| WS9 | Combat: melee, ranged ballistics, traps, the archetypes | planned |
| WS10 | Magic: casts, channels, spell shapes, the effect vocabulary, visual effects | planned |
| WS11 | Skills, levelling, items, equipment slots, the configurable action bar | planned |
| WS20 | Settlements' names, and the people who live in them and keep their day | planned |
| WS12 | The economy: the faucet/sink ledger and the bounded price controller | planned |
| WS13 | Weather and sky: fronts, precipitation, fog, lightning, wind, the day/night cycle | planned |
| WS14 | Audio: the game's voice bed over `audio-v1` | planned |
| WS15 | Chat, moderation, and the audit trail | planned |
| WS16 | The in-game console, `wintersunctl`, and the admin surface | planned |
| WS17 | The character designer | planned |
| WS18 | Accessibility, localisation, and the settings pane, including the detail-level control | in progress: the settings window and the detail control are built; accessibility and localisation remain |
| WS21 | NPC conversation: understanding typed speech, what an NPC knows, the rule base that answers, and voiced lines per locale | planned |
| WS19 | GPU offload behind `lib/gpu`: WS32's 3D view — terrain, figure, scenery, particle and light passes — run as pinned pipelines | planned |
| WS34 | Cross-target agreement, the condition of the game being complete: the world and the rules to the bit on all four Tier-1 targets, and the software frame within tolerance of one reference | planned |

Items are built in row order. An id names an item and does not place it: an
item added later takes the next id and sits where it is built. An item is
complete — tests, docs, and a green whole-project gate — before the next begins.

### Milestones

The ledger is a build order; it is not a delivery plan, and a plan that only
becomes playable at item eight is one nobody can steer. These are the
milestones the ids group into, each with an **exit criterion that is a playable
or measurable artefact**, not a checklist. Work does not proceed past a
milestone whose exit criterion is unmet.

| Milestone | Items | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 — the ground** *(met)* | WS1 | The `userland/games/` subtree exists, `deps-check` enforces `Layer::UserGame`, and the wire protocol round-trips and fuzzes clean. |
| **M1 — a world you can walk in** *(the vertical slice)* | WS2, WS3, WS4, WS5, WS6 | One character walks over generated terrain, in a window and in exclusive fullscreen, inside the §3 frame budget, with the state hash identical on all four Tier-1 targets. This is the milestone that proves or kills the software renderer. |
| **M2 — a world worth exploring** | WS25, WS32, WS33, WS26, WS27, WS28, WS29, WS30, WS31 | One seed gives the same world every time, and it is varied: every biome the realm's latitude span reaches is present with its flora, landforms, rivers, roads and settlements. One character walks from a harbour city through farmland and forest into the mountains and down into a cave, seen in 3D from wherever the player puts the camera, blocked by everything exactly where it is drawn, with the software path's frame time measured and made as fast as the CPU allows (§3), and the world digest identical run to run on each target (decision 4). |
| **M3 — a world you share** | WS7, WS8 | Two clients on one realm see each other move, characters persist across a restart, a zone handover works, and an uncleanly disconnected client leaves the realm intact at the last committed state. |
| **M4 — a game** | WS9, WS10, WS11 | The core loop is playable end to end — fight, win, level, equip, spend — and the §5 game-feel budget is met at a simulated 100 ms round trip. |
| **M5 — a world worth being in** | WS20, WS12, WS13, WS14, WS15, WS16, WS17, WS18, WS21 | Settlements inhabited and keeping their day; economy stable over the shock set; weather, audio, chat, admin, designer and accessibility all live; an inhabitant answers a typed question truthfully and in character. |
| **M6 — acceleration** | WS19 | The accelerated path draws the same picture as the software path within tolerance and holds the §3 frame budget, with the gain measured rather than claimed. |
| **M7 — complete** | WS34 | The world and the rules produce one digest on all four Tier-1 targets, a realm and its clients agree whatever CPU each runs on, and the software frame is held to one reference within the tolerance the GPU is held to. |

M2 comes before the realm server because everything after it stands on the
world: the simulation's obstacles, the zone's interest by level, and the
store's world deltas all name what WS25–WS31 generate.

M1 is deliberately the riskiest milestone and deliberately early: if a
first-party software renderer cannot hold the budget, everything downstream is
built on a wrong assumption, and the cheapest time to learn that is before the
netcode exists.

### Prerequisites owned by other plans

None of these is restated here; each is a hard dependency named so it cannot be
discovered late.

| # | What is needed | Owner | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | The audio stack exists at all: the PCM vocabulary, `audio_ring`, `audio-v1`, `audiochan-v1`, the engine, one driver, `audiod` | `plans/SOUND.md` SND2–SND4 | WS14 |
| P2 | `lib/sound`'s decoder registry and the sandboxed decode seam | `plans/SOUND.md` SND9 | WS14 |
| P3 | Window **size states** — `Restored` / `Maximized` / `Fullscreen` — on the window channel | `plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md` Stage J | WS5 — **done** |
| P9 | The live session presenting through the layer path, so a covering fullscreen surface is actually promoted to a single layer | `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md` Stages A–E | WS24 |
| P4 | `lib/crypto` gains X25519 key agreement (`lib/crypto::agree`, over the audited `x25519-dalek`, which shares the `curve25519-dalek` arithmetic already beneath `ed25519-dalek`) | `lib/crypto` | WS1 — **done** |
| P5 | Durable storage: `lib/recdb` through its transactional and recovery items | `plans/RECDB.md` RD1–RD6 | WS7 |
| P6 | The figure engine: shapes, rig, clips, blending, the art harness, and the character record a preset is | `plans/FIGURE.md` FG1–FG6 | WS6 — **done** |
| P8 | The designer engine: the parameter model, the live preview, presets and plausible generation | `plans/FIGURE.md` FG7 | WS17 — **done** |
| P7 | The GPU seam with a live backend | `plans/GPU.md` GP1–GP6 | WS19 |

P3 was the only prerequisite that changes a shipped desktop contract, and it
landed as `plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md` Stage J. What WS5 can now rely on:
`WindowSizeState` is three-valued and lives in `lib/abi` (re-exported by
`lib/controls`); `WindowRequest::SetSizeState` asks, and the applied state
comes back on `WindowEvent::Resized` **beside** the new client extent, so an
app never learns one without the other. Fullscreen takes the scan-out rather
than the work area, ignores the app's content ceiling, raises the window over
the taskbar, and withdraws the decoration without discarding it.

**Exclusive fullscreen is not a second display path.** A game does not seize
the framebuffer: it asks for `Fullscreen`, the compositor sizes its surface to
the scanout, and the present goes through the one existing display path.
Exclusive fullscreen's real benefit — no composition pass, a tear-free flip —
is the compositor promoting that surface to a single unblended layer, and
taking it any other way would be the private back-channel §17.3 forbids and
the second blend path §2.2 forbids. The promotion is
`Compositor::fullscreen_cover`, which waits for a frame that genuinely covers
the scanout, because a promoted layer has nothing beneath it to show through.

**Promotion is not reached in production yet.** It lives on the layer path,
`Compositor::present_accelerated`, and the live session presents every frame
through the software composite: no display service carries a layer stack
across the process boundary (P9). The session's `WINDOW_SIZED` witness names
the path each frame took, so on today's boards it says `composited`, and WS24
holds the same vertical to `promoted` once P9 lands.

## 0. Binding decisions

These are settled. A change that contradicts one stops and asks (§15.7).

1. **The server is authoritative and the client is assumed hostile.** A client
   sends *intents* ("I am holding north-west", "cast spell 7 at this point");
   it never sends state. Position, health, loot, currency, and progression are
   the server's, computed from intents it validated. Every field off the wire
   is bounds-checked before it reaches a rule (§5.4, §26.4). There is no trust
   level a client can reach that shortens this path.
2. **The world is a pure function of its seed, so terrain is never
   transmitted.** `wintersun/world` answers any chunk from the realm's seed and
   parameter document alone, identically on every Tier-1 target and whatever
   order chunks are asked in. The client generates the ground it walks on; the
   server sends only what the seed cannot predict — entities, and the stored
   deltas players caused. A realm pins the generator that made it
   (`Welcome::world_generator_digest`), because its stored deltas name
   generated objects and a different generator would put them on different
   ground. This is what makes a large world affordable in bandwidth and in RAM
   (§26.6, §26.7).
3. **What the seed may not decide, the server keeps secret.** Terrain is
   public: a player can see the hills anyway, and a client-side generator
   leaks nothing. Anything whose value *is* its concealment — a dungeon's
   interior layout, an unopened container's contents, an undetected trap's
   position, another player outside your awareness radius — is generated and
   held **server-side only** and streamed under interest management. A design
   that lets the client derive a secret from the seed is a defect. Natural
   caves are terrain, not secrets: a cave's shape comes from the public seed
   like the hills above it (WS31), so a modified client can map every cave as
   it can map every hill. What is inside one — a container, a creature, a trap
   — is still the server's, and a dungeon's interior still never reaches a
   client's generator.
4. **Everything authoritative agrees across all four Tier-1 targets by the
   time the game is complete, and that is a test.** The world generator computes in IEEE-754
   `f64` with the basic operations and `lib/util::mathf` — TAIRiX's own libm —
   and nothing else, and stores quantised integers; the rules are integer
   fixed point, leaving it only for one heading conversion through `mathf`.
   `mathf`'s square root and integer rounding are operations IEEE 754 defines
   exactly, so each target's instruction or runtime routine gives the same
   bits; its transcendentals are first-party Rust in one fixed order rather
   than a per-platform libm; and Rust contracts no FMA, so `a * b + c` stays
   two operations. The same source therefore yields the same bits on
   `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `riscv64` and `wasm32`. WS2 and WS3 each carry a vertical that runs a fixed seed for a
   fixed tick count on every target and asserts one state hash.

   **Until the game is complete, neither agreement across targets nor a
   seed's output staying what it was is required.** Nothing has shipped, so
   an item may change what the world generates, or trade agreement for speed
   with per-target SIMD or fused multiply-add. Such a change says so in its
   item and re-scopes the vertical it breaks, in the same change, to the
   determinism that still holds; WS34 restores agreement. Two things hold
   throughout:
   - each target gives the same result run to run;
   - the realm's generator digest is one a client recomputes from its own
     output, so a client whose world differs from its realm's is refused at
     connect rather than diverging silently (decision 2).
5. **Content is data, and there is no scripting language.** Spells, items,
   skill trees, archetypes, loot tables, weather fronts, and dialogue are
   declarative documents validated at load against a closed vocabulary of
   effects. TAIRiX ships no interpreter, no bytecode VM, and no JIT for game
   content: that would be an untrusted-code execution surface needing
   `CAP_JIT_MAP_EXEC` (§19.2), and a closed effect vocabulary reaches the same
   expressiveness without it. Adding an effect is adding a variant with its
   rule, its test, and its documentation. The world's own tables — climate,
   biomes, ground, species, landforms, settlement and building kinds — are not
   such documents: they are part of the generator, compiled into
   `wintersun/world` and covered by the generator digest a realm pins
   (decision 2), because a world every client derives for itself cannot follow
   a table the server reloaded.
6. **The renderer is software, first-party, and complete on its own.** It
   draws through `lib/raster`'s one anti-aliased scan converter and blend
   (§2.2 — no second rasteriser), parallelises over `lib/parallel`'s
   `JobRunner`, and selects SIMD kernels through `lib/cpuops`. It is the
   mandatory always-available path, exactly as the software `Display` path is
   for the desktop (§17.3). GPU offload (WS19, P7) accelerates it behind one seam;
   it never becomes a second renderer, and the game is fully playable without
   it. From WS32's 3D view on, the frame budget is the GPU path's to hold, and
   the software path is held to being as fast as the CPU allows (§3).
7. **The game is an ordinary app with an ordinary manifest.** It holds only
   what it asks for and is granted: `CAP_SHM` for its window surface, `CAP_NET`
   to reach a realm, `CAP_FS_ACCESS` for its own bundle reads, and
   `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` for the decode workers. It requests no capability the
   desktop's other apps do not, and it introduces **no new capability at all**
   — a realm's own roles (player, moderator, administrator) are the realm's
   records enforced by the server, not kernel authority, because they govern a
   game's objects and not the machine's (§5.2).
8. **The realm is three processes, not one.** A gateway holding client
   sockets, one or more zone shards simulating regions, and a single store
   process owning the database. Separate address spaces mean a zone fault
   cannot take the realm down or reach the player records, and one writer
   means the database needs no distributed commit. This is the microkernel
   decomposition applied to a game server, and it is what makes the
   thousand-player target defensible rather than asserted.
9. **Interactive surfaces obey §28 without exception.** No store read, no
   file read, no IPC round trip on the frame loop; a settings slider changes
   the in-memory model and repaints, and writes once when it settles; a paint
   reads nothing; a burst of pointer motion produces one frame. The character
   designer and the detail-level slider are the two surfaces most likely to
   violate this — the slider being the charter's own worked example — and both
   are specified against it explicitly (WS17, WS18).
10. **`abi-v1` is not frozen, and the game does not touch it anyway.** The
    game's wire protocol is the game's own, in `wintersun/net`, held to the
    `lib/abi` *discipline* — versioned, fixed-width, bounded decode, fail
    closed, fuzzed — but not in `lib/abi`, which is the user/kernel contract
    (§9). The one exception is P3's window size states, which are genuinely
    desktop ABI and land in the desktop's plan.

## 1. Where each piece lives, and why there

**A game is not an OS library, and none of it goes in `lib/*`.** `lib/` is the
OS's shared-library namespace; a game's world generator, combat rules and wire
protocol have no business in it, whatever the build graph would make
convenient.

The convenience in question was real, and it is worth naming so it is not
re-discovered: five separate userland programs — the client, the three realm
server binaries, and the admin command — share one simulation, and
`cargo xtask deps-check` forbids a `userland/*` crate from depending on another
`userland/*` crate (§17.4). That constraint is satisfied by giving games their
own **layer**, not by moving game code into the OS libraries.

`userland/games/` is therefore a leaf subtree modelled exactly on
`userland/gui/`, which already does this and is already enforced: its crates
compose each other and `lib/*`, and **nothing outside the subtree may depend on
them**. So game code cannot leak into the OS even by accident — the check fails
the build.

```
userland/games/wintersun/
├── app/      # the client `Run` + the three realm server binaries → WinterSun.app
├── ctl/      # wintersunctl — the admin command bundle
├── art/      # material synthesis, the splat field, decals, particles, palette
├── figure/   # rigs, sockets, pose clips, blending, motion layers, the designer
├── net/      # the realm wire protocol and session handshake
├── rules/    # the authoritative simulation and the game rules
├── scenery/  # parametric scenery art: flora, rocks, clutter, structures (WS27)
├── talk/     # NPC conversation: understanding, the rule base, voiced lines
└── world/    # the seed-pure procedural world generator
```

The split into crates is not decoration: it makes the boundaries the build
enforces rather than the reviewer. The server binaries cannot reach the render
code because they do not depend on the crate that holds it, and `ctl` reaches
only `net`.

**WS1 adds `Layer::UserGame` to `tools/xtask/src/commands/deps_check.rs`** —
`classify` gains a `userland/games/` arm *before* the generic `userland/` arm,
`layer_allows` gains `UserGame => matches!(to, Lib | UserGame)`, and the
existing no-reverse-dependents check is extended to the subtree. That ordering
matters: the arm must precede the generic one or every game crate classifies as
plain `Userland` and its internal edges are refused. The failure mode if the arm
is ever removed is the *safe* one — game crates fall back to lib-only and the
build complains — which is why the subtree is nested under `userland/` rather
than made a new top-level tree, whose fallthrough in `classify` is
`Layer::Tooling` and therefore exempt from layering altogether.

**What this work adds to `lib/*` is only what the OS itself wants:**
`lib/recdb` (`plans/RECDB.md` — the record store whose other consumers are the
account database, the journal index and the app-data blob index), `lib/gpu`
(`plans/GPU.md` — whose other consumer is the compositor), and a `shape` module
in `lib/raster` holding the parametric outline primitives that `cinder` and
this game genuinely share (`plans/FIGURE.md` FG1). Nothing else.

```
userland/games/wintersun/app/     # /System/Applications/wintersun.app
├── AppInfo                       #   signed manifest: kind = application
├── Run                           #   the client (and the listen-server host)
├── Code/wintersund               #   the dedicated gateway
├── Code/wintersun-zone           #   a zone shard worker
├── Code/wintersun-store          #   the realm's single database writer
├── Resources/                    #   the icon, the figure presets, content documents
└── Help/<locale>/                #   structured-Markdown help, en-US mandatory
```

Everything with behaviour worth testing is in the non-binary crates; `app/` and
`ctl/` only compose — the pattern `userland/apps/sapper` and
`userland/apps/cinder` already follow, and the reason `cinder`'s frame advance
was moved out of its `Run` binary (`plans/CINDER.md` B3a: a freestanding binary
is reachable by no host test, which is how a companion that walked on the spot
survived a green pipeline three times).

**The bundle is self-contained** (§16.5). The `Run` binary, every `Code/`
binary, the manifest, the figure presets, the content documents, the icon, and
the help tree are real files inside `WinterSun.app`. Nothing is compiled into
the kernel or the image builder, and no central list of content exists: the
content documents are discovered by scanning `Resources/`, exactly as drivers
are discovered from their bundles (§16.5, §18.6).

**A realm is started, not installed.** `Run` with no realm hosts one locally
(it spawns the three server binaries and connects to itself over the loopback
path, so the single-player and multiplayer code paths are the same code —
there is no offline mode to keep in sync). `wintersund` is the dedicated form
for a machine that serves only.

## 2. WS2/WS20/WS25–WS31 — the world, and who lives in it

A realm is a `u64` seed and a small parameter document. Generation is a
pipeline of pure stages over a chunk grid; each stage reads its inputs at a
coarser scale than it writes, so a chunk needs only a bounded halo of its
neighbours and never the whole world.

**"A coarser scale" is one scale, fixed, and global.** Stages 1–5 and 7 are
not local questions — discharge depends on the whole upstream basin, a rain
shadow on everything the wind crossed, a road on reaching the town at its far
end — and a window *centred on the asking chunk* gives a different answer per
query, which is a river that flows uphill across a seam. So they are solved
once over a **realm field**: a coarse grid of a fixed sample count, global and
exact, and therefore seam-free by construction rather than by a halo that
happens to be wide enough. A fixed sample count, never a step in world units,
is also what keeps its cost the same for a realm four chunks across and one
four thousand chunks across.

The chunk stage is the fine one: it reads the realm field, adds everything
below the coarse step, and depends on nothing outside a fixed ring of cells.
Only two kinds of quantity it computes depend on neighbours — the shore
distance, a distance transform, and the slope and drainage-gradient stencils —
which is why the ring exists; its radius is the widest of those bands plus the
scatter step a footing is read across. Scatter (6) is inherently fine and runs
there, last, because it reads the structure stamp: nothing grows on a road.

1. **Uplift.** Continental plates as a Voronoi partition of the sphere-mapped
   plane with per-plate drift; boundary convergence gives mountain belts,
   divergence gives rifts and inland seas. This is what stops a heightfield
   looking like noise: ranges get a direction and a reason.
2. **Relief.** Multi-octave gradient noise, domain-warped, amplitude-shaped by
   the uplift field, with ridged octaves inside mountain belts and billowed
   octaves in dunes. All from `lib/rng`'s deterministic non-cryptographic tier,
   keyed per stage so adding a stage cannot shift an earlier one's output.
3. **Hydrology.** Flow direction and accumulation over the relief; channels
   where accumulation crosses a threshold, widening downstream — streams
   become rivers become estuaries. Lakes fill depressions to their outflow.
   Then a bounded pass of hydraulic erosion and sediment deposition, which is
   what cuts valleys the roads later follow and lays the flats the settlements
   later use. Rivers carry a discharge value, so a ford is possible where a
   bridge is not needed.
4. **Climate.** Temperature from latitude, altitude, and a continentality term.
   Moisture advected from water bodies along prevailing winds, with orographic
   lift on windward slopes and a rain shadow behind — which gives a desert a
   reason to be where it is.
5. **Biomes.** A classification over temperature, precipitation and
   seasonality, with altitude, drainage and salinity overrides, producing a
   biome and a **normalised weight vector** over the ground materials. A biome
   boundary is therefore a gradient, and §3's splatting draws it as one. Which
   biomes a realm holds follows from its latitude span; the default realm runs
   from ice sheet to rainforest (WS25).
6. **Scatter.** Vegetation, rocks, and resource nodes placed by Poisson-disk
   sampling weighted by biome, slope, and moisture, so nothing grows on a cliff
   and a forest has spacing rather than clumps.
7. **Sites.** Settlements on flat, watered, defensible ground near a
   confluence or a coast; then roads as least-cost paths (A* over a traversal
   cost field that prefers valleys and level ground, pays to cross a river, and
   reuses an existing road — so roads converge and braid like real ones);
   then dungeon and shrine entrances, ruins, and rift scars. A site's
   *entrance* is world data; its *interior* is server-only (decision 3).

WS25–WS31 widen stages 4–7, add landforms, the district scale and cave
levels, and are set out after WS20.

**Scale.** A chunk is generated on demand, cached in a `lib/reclaim`-governed
cache sized from discovered RAM, and dropped under pressure — never stored,
because it is cheaper to recompute than to page in, and never resident in
bulk. Player-caused changes are the only world state that persists, as sparse
deltas in the store, applied over the generated base. A realm's world is
therefore O(changes) on disk and O(working set) in RAM regardless of its
extent, which is what §26.7's floor demands.

**Generation is incremental and interruptible.** A chunk's stages are
individually bounded and resumable, and generation runs on `lib/parallel`'s
runner (`Serial` where there is no second core, which is not a stub but the
correct runner). A client never blocks a frame on generation: a chunk not yet
ready draws as the coarse relief the previous stage already answered (§28.5 —
a paint reads nothing and draws a meaningful placeholder for what has not
arrived).

**What WS2 now guarantees.** The realm field solves plates, relief with a
sea-level cut that honours the requested submerged fraction, Priority-Flood
drainage with stream-power incision and hillslope diffusion, climate,
settlements, minimum-spanning-tree roads routed by integer-cost A\* that
reuses existing road, and landmark entrances. The chunk adds detail relief,
the channel carve, the structure stamp, the climate correction, the biome and
ground blends, and the scatter. Standing water fills a chunk only where the
coarse field holds a lake or the sea: a hollow in the detail relief on dry
ground stays dry. Determinism is staked on one constant,
`digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST`, asserted by the host suite and by one vertical per
Tier-1 target (`tests/integration/world_determinism_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,
x86_64}` and `tests/integration/world_determinism_wasm32`, the last under a
plain WebAssembly engine because its subject is arithmetic and a browser would
narrow where it can run). The crate decodes no bytes — a parameter document's
wire form belongs with the protocol in `wintersun/net` — so it has no
untrusted-input parser and no fuzz target of its own.

`Facing` gained `unit_vector` in `wintersun/net`, with the type, because the
wind is the first consumer to need an angle convention and two crates picking
opposite ones would be a defect neither could see.

**Where `lib/parallel` attaches, and why not inside this crate.** The
parallelism worth having is over *chunks*, not within one: a chunk's phases
are sequential by dependency, so a runner inside the build would have nothing
to overlap. `ChunkBuild` is therefore exactly the unit a `JobRunner` runs —
`for_each` over a slice of them, one `step` per visit — and the composition
belongs to the client that owns the runner and the frame budget (WS5). Adding
the wrapper here before that caller exists would be speculative surface, and
each build is already independent of every other, so the composition needs
nothing from this crate that it does not already have.

The *simulation's* determinism vertical is a different claim over a different
subject and lives with the code that ticks (§5).

### WS20 — settlements, and the people who live in them

WS30 gives a settlement its ground — streets, plots, buildings, walls, a
harbour and the fields around it. This item gives it a name, and people who
keep a day there.

- **A name is world data, generated as sounds and spelled per locale.** A new
  stage names every settlement, landmark, river of note and mountain range.
  Each continental plate names in its own voice — a phonotactic model of
  sounds, syllable shapes, and the elements that mean ford, hill or harbour —
  so names sound as though they belong where they are, and a place can be
  named for what is there: a ford town takes its river's name. The sounds are
  what the world digest folds. Each shipped locale spells them in its own
  script through a table compiled into the crate, so a player reads and can
  type every name in the script they play in, and `world` still decodes no
  bytes. Names are public: the seed decides them and a signpost shows them.
- **People are the server's.** A settlement's households are generated from
  its kind, its layout, and what its ground and water offer — trappers in the
  boreal north, fishers at a port — each person with a name in their plate's
  voice, a trade, a home, a post, kin, a body (a WS6 preset varied through
  `plausible::figure`) and a timetable. They come from the realm's secret seed
  (§8), never the public one, so a client can no more place a town's people
  from the seed than see a player outside its interest (decision 3). A
  person's name travels as its sounds and is spelled by the client that
  receives it.
- **A day is a timetable, so a town costs nothing until someone is in it.** A
  timetable runs over the hour of the realm's day — the tick counter against
  `RealmParameters::day_length_seconds` — along lanes routed once per
  settlement between home, post, market and inn. Where an undisturbed person
  stands is therefore a pure function of the clock: a settlement nobody can
  see is not simulated at all, its people are placed where their timetables
  say when someone arrives, and the zone ticks only the people inside someone's
  interest. A departure from the timetable — talking, fleeing, sheltering —
  lives in the zone while it lasts and is never stored; unobserved, a person
  resumes their timetable.
- **A settlement is a refuge.** Players cannot harm its people: in a shared
  realm, one player killing the only smith breaks a town for everyone. Harm a
  player would deal an inhabitant is refused with its reason, like any refused
  action; a person endangered by anything else flees home and recovers. None
  is ever lost, so a settlement never needs repopulating, and its people cost
  the store nothing — they are regenerated from the key, and what happens to
  them belongs to other records: a vendor's stock to WS12, what they remember
  of you to WS21.
- **WS12's vendors are these people**, at their posts: the smith at the forge,
  the trader in the market.
- **Scale.** Population follows a site's kind and extent, a rule and not a
  capacity (§24.1). People are cached under `lib/reclaim` like the layouts
  they live in, regenerated when dropped, and generated off the tick on the
  zone.

### The world, first class (WS25–WS31)

WS2's pipeline stays; what it produces is too narrow.
- Its rivers, streams and roads run straight between coarse samples.
- Its settlements stop at a walled town.
- Its trees are placed but neither drawn nor solid.
- It has no caves.

These items make the world as varied as a real one without giving up
anything decision 2 and WS2 stand on. WS32 and WS33, which show the world in
3D from a camera the player positions, and WS27, which draws what they place
and makes it solid, are in §3. Every new stage is a pure function of the realm,
seam-free by construction, bounded in memory by the working set, and folded
into `digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST`. An item that moves that constant records the
new value deliberately.

#### Five tiers, and who owns what

- **Realm field** (as now) — global, coarse, a fixed sample count. It keeps
  what depends on the whole world, and gains:
  - rock provinces, circulation belts and seasons (WS25);
  - volcanoes and hotspot chains (WS28);
  - the river reach network and the primary settlements and roads (WS29,
    WS30);
  - a **feature index** (WS28): a coarse bucket grid naming the realm
    features that reach each tile, so a chunk reads what touches it rather
    than walking every site and road in the realm, as
    `ChunkBuild::structures` does now.

  Its size still never follows the realm's extent.
- **District** (WS26) — a fixed absolute square of 512 cells, solved on
  demand and cached under `lib/reclaim`. It holds what is regional and too
  numerous for the realm field:
  - forest stands and glades (WS26);
  - brooks, ponds and springs (WS29);
  - villages, hamlets, farmsteads, lanes and field systems (WS30);
  - cave mouths (WS31).

  Density is per square kilometre, so a larger realm has more villages, not
  sparser ones. Placement is scatter's priority rule one tier up. Each
  district offers candidates at hashed positions with hashed priorities, and
  a candidate survives only if nothing within its exclusion outranks it. No
  exclusion reaches past the neighbouring districts, so a district depends on
  its eight neighbours' offers and nothing further. Two districts therefore
  agree about their seam without either solving the other.
- **Feature** (WS28–WS31) — one solve per identified feature: a volcano's
  profile, a river reach's or road's refined centreline, a crossing, a
  settlement's layout and farmland, a cave system. Each is keyed by a stable
  feature id, cached, and stamped into every chunk it reaches, so a building
  on a seam is one building from either side by construction.
- **Chunk** (as now) — fine relief, carve, stamps, climate correction,
  classification, and the chunk's objects.
- **Decoration** (WS26) — grass blades, weeds, flowers, pebbles, leaf litter.
  Each is a pure function of the seed, the cell and the cell's ground, drawn
  by the client and never stored, simulated or sent. Anything a player can
  collide with, gather or change is an object; anything that only makes
  ground look like ground is decoration.

A chunk reads the realm field, the districts its halo overlaps, and the
features the index names — nothing else. "A chunk generated alone equals the
same chunk generated with its neighbours" stays a theorem.

- **Every object has one owner:** the chunk holding its anchor, or the
  feature that emitted it. A wall, fence, hedge or road is emitted by its
  feature as per-chunk pieces under one feature id. A query over a region
  consults the owners within the region grown by the largest reach its
  object classes declare. That is how drawing and collision see an object
  crossing a seam exactly once.
- **Every object has an identity:** its owner, and its ordinal in the
  owner's deterministic emission order. A world delta (a felled tree, a
  broken fence) names it by that identity, and a second identifier scheme
  for the same thing is refused (WS26).
- **Streaming stays off the frame.** The client's quarry solves what a view
  needs in dependency order — districts and features before the chunks that
  read them — nearest first, on a worker count derived from the discovered
  cores, keeping every answer. That generalises `terrain::ChunkDesk`'s rule.
  The zone does the same off the tick.

#### What WS25 settled

The realm field gained a latitude span, circulation belts, seasons and rock
provinces, and the chunk classifies biomes apart from the ground they cover.
What a later item needs to know:

- **The parameter document is `net::value::RealmSpec`**, one fixed-width wire
  item that `Welcome` carries and `RealmParams::new` validates: the wire
  admits any value and the world refuses what it cannot solve, an edge
  latitude off the planet or a north edge south of the south one included.
  `fuzz_wire` decodes every `Welcome`, so the document is fuzzed where it is
  decoded. WS8's client builds its realm as `RealmParams::new(welcome.realm)`;
  a local session builds `RealmParams::default_realm(seed)`, 76°N to 6°S.
  World edits name a ground (`WorldChange::Ground`).
- **Temperature** is a sea-level zonal curve tabulated every 10° of latitude,
  less the lapse rate, less a continentality cooling that grows toward the
  poles, plus jitter. The seasonal range grows with latitude and
  continentality and shrinks over the sea. The warm and cold seasons are the
  mean plus and minus half the range; the treeline is a 10 °C warm season and
  the snowline a 0 °C one.
- **Precipitation follows four airflows**: each hemisphere's westerlies and
  the easterly return flow beside them, the trades and polar easterlies, the
  southern flows mirroring the northern. Each is advected by the upwind-first
  sweep once per solstice season with the belts shifted 7° toward the summer
  pole, and weighed by how much it prevails at each latitude. Air over water
  takes up moisture and rains on the sea; over land it loses moisture to
  orographic lift and the latitude's belt rain and regains some by recycling
  where it is warm. The rain season is summer rain less winter rain over the
  total, so the poleward edge of a dry belt is winter-wet and its equatorward
  edge summer-wet.
- **Rock provinces** are a jittered-grid Voronoi partition four times finer
  than the plates. Their boundaries wander through the shared domain warp
  (`noise::warp`, on a stage of their own), and their setting is read through
  the relief's own continental warp (`relief::continental_warp`). Plates and
  provinces share one exact nearest-site search (`voronoi::nearest`): at a
  jitter past a third a site two cells off can be the nearest, so the rings
  beyond the nine cells are searched while one could still hold it. Rock
  follows setting: oceanic or rifting ground is basalt, a strong belt granite
  or a metamorphic core, a weaker one folded sediments, old buoyant ground
  shield, and the rest platform sediments. Only basalt is volcanic. Soils are a soft partition over parent
  rock, climate and floodplain: alluvium, loess, laterite, podzol, chernozem,
  brown earth and desert crust.
- **Biome and ground are two blends** of one type, `blend::Blend<K>`, generic
  over the `Kind` it weighs and normalised to 255 by largest remainder; an
  unused slot holds the heaviest kind, so equal blends compare equal. The
  classifier and the palettes read dry ground only: the chunk writes open
  water and water where water covers a cell, and skips its reading there.
  - The classifier is a soft decision tree whose every split is a partition
    of unity (`geom::rise`), so its totality holds by construction. Terrain
    overrides — rifts, volcanic basalt, gullied soft rock, wetlands and
    coasts — reallocate shares with `take`, which preserves the sum.
  - Aridity is Köppen's: effective moisture is precipitation over
    `20·(T + 7 + 7s)` mm.
  - Wetlands need drainage wetness, `a/(a + K·tanβ)` over specific catchment
    and gradient. That is a monotone form of the topographic wetness index,
    because `mathf` has no logarithm.
  - A coast faces a lake or the sea: the shore transform carries which water
    is nearest, a tie going to the more standing, and a river's bank is no
    coast.
  - Each biome grows a palette of grounds modulated by moisture, wetness,
    soil, rock, a patch field and slope; a steep face turns to its rock and
    scree whatever grows around it.
- **The vocabularies** are the 28 biomes WS25 named and 39 grounds, each
  identifier frozen per member (`Kind::id`). The built grounds — tilled soil,
  pasture, paddy, cobbles, flagstones, packed earth, road metal — arrive with
  WS29 and WS30, which generate them, and molten lava with WS28's craters: a
  variant nothing generates would be dead. Roads draw gravel until then.
- **The sea stands flat at sea level.** A cell is sea where the coarse water
  about it is mostly the sea's (`Coarse::sea_share`, weighing only the
  samples that hold water); only a lake's surface is still the coarse one.
- **Thresholds hold at any coarse step.** Wetness, floodplains, a settlement's
  water and a shrine's stream read specific catchment in cells
  (`hydrology::specific_catchment`), which leaves out a sample's own area so a
  ridge top drains nothing; settlement and landmark slopes are per cell. Each
  is calibrated on the default realm's 64-cell step.
- **Seams.** Everything a scatter footing reads is exact within one scatter
  step of the chunk: the shore distance and the water it faces; the cleared
  flag, recorded on halo cells; channels, whose window reaches past the ring
  by a bed's width at every coarse step; and one reading, which serves the
  chunk and its halo alike. A road segment reaches a chunk by its whole
  extent, not its endpoints. A chunk coordinate past the farthest whose cells a
  position can name is refused (`WorldError::OutOfRange`).
- **Landmarks** take a fair share per kind, ranked by a per-kind lattice draw,
  with slope measured per cell, and rift scars stand in rifts.
- **The client** holds its ground set in a `lib/inline::BitSet256`, bounded by
  the ground count at compile time, lights with a neutral daylight `Sun` and
  `Sky` until WS13, and takes `--seed SEED` (or `--seed=SEED`). Without one it
  draws a seed and, once its world is generated, leaves a `context` record,
  `world.seed_drawn`, on `stdinfo` with the command that reopens the same
  world.
- **Cost.** Most of a chunk's cost is the biome phase's per-cell
  classification and noise. `Blend::normalise` selects its heaviest four in
  one pass, one `RealmField::coarse_at` read serves every scalar a cell takes
  from the coarse field, relief skips the noise its weights multiply away,
  and a wet cell skips its reading. The province wander is the largest
  per-cell cost left; a chunk that provably lies inside one province could
  skip it exactly.
- **The digests** are pinned once each, as the `REFERENCE_DIGEST` constants of
  `world/src/digest.rs`, `art/src/digest.rs` and `app/src/digest.rs`.
- **Tests.**
  - The classifier is total, and each climate grows its archetype.
  - The treeline climbs with warmth, wetlands sit in wet flats, and each
    coast follows its rock and slope.
  - Every rock setting occurs, only basalt is volcanic, and province
    boundaries wander.
  - The default realm holds every biome, none above a fifth of the land.
  - Five probe realms hold every biome between them: polar, equatorial, a
    dry continent, a many-plated one, and one with turned westerlies.
  - The ground set spans the climate range, and every pair of grounds the
    world lays in one cell or side by side, surveyed across five realms,
    stays distinguishable.
  - The nearest-site search agrees with a brute-force search, including
    where the nine cells miss the nearest.
  - A footing, a road and the sea each read the same from either side of a
    seam, and a seam reads the same at every coarse step.

#### WS26 — flora, rocks and clutter

- **A closed object vocabulary.** An `ObjectKind` is a flora species, a rock,
  deadwood (log, stump, snag, windfall), or a piece of clutter. WS29–WS31 add
  crossings, structures and cave formations to the same vocabulary. Each
  kind's static properties are one compiled row:
  - footprint shape and size range;
  - whether it blocks bodies;
  - its height class (ground, low or canopy), which decides the pass that
    draws it and, later, what it hides;
  - its exclusion radius, and the steepest ground it stands on;
  - what it yields to WS11's gathering.
- **Species, not "a tree".** A species is a crown archetype with
  proportions, a leaf palette and size classes. The archetypes are conifer
  spire, broadleaf dome, columnar, weeping, palm, baobab, cactus column and
  pad, bamboo clump, tree fern, mangrove, shrub mound, tussock, reed clump,
  fern and rosette. Per biome, a table gives each species its abundance and
  clustering:
  - tundra grows dwarf birch and willow scrub;
  - savanna grows acacia and baobab over grass;
  - jungle grows emergents over palms and ferns;
  - nothing grows a palm in the snow.
- **Layers.** Canopy, understory and ground layers each get their own
  priority pass, at their own step and exclusion. A forest therefore has a
  canopy with shrubs beneath, not one mixed layer. Each pass keeps the
  existing rule: one candidate per scatter cell, surviving only if nothing
  within its exclusion outranks it.
- **Forest structure.**
  - A low-frequency dominance field gives stands: birch among spruce, not
    salt-and-pepper.
  - Density thins across an ecotone instead of stopping at a line.
  - Glades are district-scale clearings with irregular edges, meadow ground
    and flowers.
  - Riparian belts of willow and alder follow channels, with reeds in the
    shallows.
  - Deadwood follows forest age and moisture.
- **Rocks by geology.** A boulder's kind and size follow its rock class and
  setting: scree fields below cliffs, erratics on glaciated plains, desert
  outcrops, basalt blocks on lava fields, limestone pavement.
- **Wild clutter.** Driftwood and shells on beaches, bones in wastes, termite
  mounds in savanna, anthills and burrows on grassland, fungi in damp
  forest, seaweed on shores.
- **Ground cover is decoration.** Each ground names its decoration (blades,
  tufts, weeds, flowers, fern fronds, pebbles, litter, lichen, reed stems)
  and a density. Positions are hashed from the seed, the cell and a slot, so
  nothing is stored and a cell always shows the same tufts.
- **Identity on the wire.** `wintersun/net`'s edit vocabulary names a
  generated object by the object identity. Where `StructureId` or
  `ResourceNodeId` name the same things, the object identity replaces them
  rather than standing beside them.
- **Tests.**
  - Every object in a region is reported once, by its owner, from either
    side of a seam.
  - No two objects of a layer stand inside each other's exclusion.
  - Nothing stands on a road, in water, in a glade, or on ground steeper
    than its kind allows.
  - No species grows outside the biomes its table names.
  - Stands are seam-free, and district placement is order-independent.
  - The world digest folds objects and a probe district.

#### WS28 — landforms

- **Volcanoes.**
  - Arcs form along convergent seams, placed from the uplift stage's
    boundary type and buoyancy.
  - Hotspots are a few seeded plumes that the drifting plates carry cones
    away from. The chains they leave age along the drift, and the oldest
    subside into atolls in warm seas.
  - Each volcano is a realm feature: kind (stratovolcano, shield, cinder
    cone, caldera), height, radius, crater and activity. It is stamped into
    the coarse relief before drainage, so rivers radiate from it.
  - Into chunks it is stamped as its fine profile: gullies, a crater or
    caldera lake, basalt flows down its flanks, an ash apron, fumaroles and
    hot springs.
  - Molten lava lies only in active craters, and is impassable ground like
    deep water.
- **Islands.**
  - Continental islands come from the relief, as now.
  - Volcanic chains and atolls come from the hotspots.
  - Barrier islands and lagoons form along low sandy coasts; skerries and
    islets fringe rocky ones.
  - An atoll or islet is smaller than the coarse step, so it is a
    chunk-scale stamp from its feature, not a coarse sample.
- **Mesas, canyons and badlands.** Arid sandstone relief is terraced by a
  stepped transfer on elevation with perturbed steps, giving flat caps, cliff
  bands and talus. Rock erodibility enters the stream-power law, so rivers
  cut canyons through soft beds under hard caps. Dry clay provinces become
  badlands through a dense gully carve.
- **Karst.** Wet limestone grows sinkholes, disappearing streams and
  pavement, and is where WS31's caves are densest.
- **Coasts.** Steep relief meeting the sea makes cliffs, not beaches. A
  sheltered-water measure (how much of the horizon land closes off) finds
  the coves and bays WS30's harbours are built in.
- **Glaciers.** Ice above the snowline widens the valleys it fills into
  U-profiles and leaves boulder moraines. Where it reaches the sea it leaves
  fjords.
- **The feature index** lands here, with the first realm features a chunk
  must find: volcanoes and hotspot chains. WS29 moves roads and rivers onto
  it.
- **Tests.**
  - Every volcano sits in its tectonic setting.
  - Every crater drains or holds a lake.
  - Atolls occur only in warm seas, and terraces only where their rock and
    climate say.
  - No landform leaves an undrained pit outside a lake or sinkhole.
  - Every chunk stamp of a feature agrees across seams.
  - The world digest folds a probe of each landform.

#### WS29 — water and roads

What stands now, and is this item's to change: every channel is a straight
segment between two coarse samples, so a stream runs dead straight across the
land at a constant width and turns only where it meets a sample — where a
stream of any size should wind unevenly and meander. And a channel is cut to
its bed wherever it runs, with no bank graded between the bed and the ground beside
it, so wherever the fine relief stands above a river's surface the bank is a
cliff the rules' one-unit step cannot climb; and even the smallest channel's
centre is deeper than a body wades. Every river is therefore an uncrossable
canyon, and the land between rivers is walkable only in pieces. The client's
start search steps around this (`landfall`), but a player who walks off a
bank is still in a trench they cannot leave, and the crossings, fords and
graded banks below are what resolve it.

- **Rivers as a map shows them.** The coarse drainage becomes a network of
  reaches with discharge and stream order. Each reach is a feature:
  - Its centreline is smoothed through the coarse path, so no reach turns at
    45°.
  - It meanders by a seeded displacement across the centreline, with
    amplitude following channel width and dying away with slope. A river
    loops across a floodplain and runs straight through a gorge.
  - Floodplains of alluvium widen with discharge.
  - A meander loop tight enough to cut off leaves an oxbow lake.
  - A steep drop is rapids; a drop over a cliff band is a waterfall.
  - A bank grades from the water's edge to the ground beside it within the
    rules' step, except where the relief is a cliff band — so a player who
    reaches a river can always climb back out of it.
  - A high-discharge mouth on a sheltered coast fans into a delta's
    distributaries; otherwise it widens into an estuary.
- **Lakes where basins are.** Priority-Flood fills every pit in the coarse
  relief, so noise alone makes lakes: one of the reference realm's probe
  chunks is nearly half lake with no sea in it. A pit whose basin is too
  small or shallow for a lake is breached instead, its outlet carved along
  the least-cost path, and only a true basin fills. Each lake is then a
  feature with one flat surface at its outflow level, replacing the coarse
  surface the chunk now interpolates, which slopes across a coarse cell. The
  sea already stands flat.
- **Small water.**
  - Brooks carry wet hollows to the nearest channel, at district scale and
    downhill by construction, and wind as rivers do, at their own scale.
    No watercourse of any size is a straight segment.
  - Ponds sit in the hollows the wetness index marks, and springs head
    brooks.
  - Oases sit where a desert meets the foot of higher ground.
- **A road network, not a tree.** The primary network joins cities and towns
  by a relative-neighbourhood graph rather than a spanning tree, so there
  are loops and alternatives. Routing uses the existing integer A\*, with
  costs by rank.
  - The ranks are highway, road, lane, track and path, each with a width, a
    surface and verges.
  - Each road is a feature whose centreline is smoothed and, where the slope
    exceeds its rank's grade, re-routed into switchbacks.
- **Every crossing is built.** Where a road meets water it becomes one of:
  - a bridge, stone or timber by rank and span;
  - a ford, over shallow, slow water;
  - a ferry, over wide rivers and lakes;
  - a causeway, over marsh.

  A bridge is an object with solid parapets, and its deck is not an obstacle
  but ground: the rules' terrain reports the deck's height over the water it
  spans, so a body crosses on it and cannot step off it into the river.
  Junctions carry signposts and milestones.
- **Tests.**
  - No watercourse runs straight: every reach's centreline strays from the
    chord between its ends by a stated share of its length, and its width
    varies along it.
  - Water surfaces fall monotonically along every refined centreline.
  - A meander never crosses another channel or leaves its floodplain.
  - Every reach ends in the sea, a lake or a sink, and every distributary
    reaches the sea.
  - The road graph connects every landmass holding more than one primary
    settlement, with ferries to its islands.
  - No road crosses water except by a built crossing.
  - Switchbacks hold their rank's grade.
  - Every stamp agrees across seams.

#### WS30 — settlements and the land they farm

- **A hierarchy, spaced like a real one.**
  - Cities, towns, ports and castles are realm features. They are placed by
    suitability and spaced by central-place rules: cities far apart, towns
    between them. Their count follows land area, bounded by the realm
    field's own size.
  - Villages, hamlets, farmsteads and special sites are district-scale, so
    their density is per square kilometre. The special sites are a mill on a
    stream, an inn at a crossroads, a logging camp, a quarry or mine at an
    outcrop, a fishing hamlet, a shrine, a ruin, and standing stones.
  - `SiteKind` widens to match.
- **Laid out, not stamped.** A settlement's layout is a feature solve:
  - The roads entering it become its streets. A street network grows by
    kind: organic lanes for a village, a planned grid for a new town, radial
    streets for a walled market town. It includes squares and a market.
  - Plots line the streets by frontage.
  - Buildings stand on plots, each with a footprint and a kind: house, barn,
    workshop, smithy, inn, temple, hall, warehouse, tower, keep, mill,
    stable. Yards and gardens are fenced.
  - Towns and cities are walled along defensible ground, with towers at the
    corners and gates where roads enter.
  - A port's harbour has quays along sheltered water, piers and jetties out
    to deep enough water, a breakwater where the bay is open, and slipways.
  - Streets carry clutter: carts, barrels, crates, woodpiles, wells,
    troughs, stalls.
  - Building material follows rock and climate: stone where rock is at hand,
    timber in forest, mud brick in hot drylands, thatch in wetlands.
- **A building is an exterior:** a footprint the collision field treats as
  solid, and a door. Someone inside is neither drawn nor addressable until
  they come out; enterable interiors are not part of this plan.
- **The land they farm.** Around each settlement, within its walking reach,
  the land is divided into parcels, each on the ground its use makes:
  - strip fields by a village, enclosed fields elsewhere;
  - pasture on slopes and wet ground;
  - orchards and vineyards on warm slopes;
  - rice paddies terraced into warm, wet hillsides;
  - woodlots at the margin, and gardens by the houses.

  Boundaries follow the region, and are objects, drawn and solid, with gates
  where tracks pass: hedgerows in temperate lowland, drystone walls in rocky
  upland, timber fences near forest, ditches in wetland. Crop rows follow
  their field's orientation, which the splat reads per cell.
- **Tests.**
  - Every plot fronts a street, and every street reaches the road network.
  - Every building lies within its plot and overlaps no other building,
    road, wall or water.
  - Every wall ring is closed, and every gate is on a road through it.
  - Every quay fronts water of at least a stated depth.
  - Parcels tile the farmland without overlap and never cross water or a
    road.
  - A boundary always leaves a gap where a track passes.
  - Buildings, walls and fences block movement exactly where they are
    drawn.
  - No settlement stands on water, ice or lava, and densities fall within
    stated bands.
  - The world digest folds a probe city and a probe port.

#### WS31 — caves, and the levels they need

- **Levels.** The surface is level 0, and each cave system is a level of its
  own: a bounded map with its own floor, walls, water and objects, entered
  through mouths on the surface.
  - Positions carry their level: `wintersun/net` adds it beside `WorldPoint`
    in entity state and intents.
  - The rules' zone, broad phase and terrain answer per level, so a body
    underground never meets a surface obstacle.
  - A mouth is a portal the rules resolve, and the client draws the player's
    level alone.
- **Public, like the hills** (decision 3). A cave's shape comes from the
  public seed, so every client derives the same caves without their
  geometry crossing the wire. What a cave holds stays the server's.
- **Kinds by geology.**
  - Karst caves in wet limestone: branching passages along joints, chambers,
    underground rivers and lakes, formations, and skylights under sinkholes.
  - Lava tubes on volcanic flanks: long tubes with collapse skylights.
  - Sea caves in sea cliffs.
  - Mines beside WS30's mining sites: adits, galleries and shafts.
- **Generation.** A cave system is a feature solve: a graph of chambers and
  passages grown from the mouth along the rock's joint directions, carved
  into the level's grid. Each kind has a fixed maximum extent, a containment
  bound. Objects include formations, rubble and pools. Mouths are
  district-scale: on cliff faces, valley sides, sinkholes, volcanic flanks
  and sea cliffs.
- **Tests.**
  - Every chamber is reachable from a mouth, and every mouth leads to its
    cave.
  - Levels are isolated from one another.
  - A round trip through a mouth returns a body to where it entered.
  - Cave layouts are seam-free and order-independent.
  - The world digest folds a probe cave, and the rules digest's reference
    run crosses a mouth.

## 3. WS4/WS5/WS32/WS33/WS27 — what it looks like

### Texture splatting, not tiles

Terrain has no tile grid. Each terrain sample carries the biome stage's
normalised material weights, and a pixel is the weighted blend of its
materials — but blended by **height-offset weighting**, not linearly: each
material carries a height field, and the material whose (weight + height)
is greatest wins most of the pixel. That is what makes gravel emerge through
grass in patches rather than fading into a grey average, and it costs one extra
texture read.

- **Materials are synthesised, not shipped.** A material is a parameter set —
  base and variation colours, grain scale, height octaves, roughness — from
  which `wintersun/art` generates its texture and height at load, once per
  (material, mip), into the reclaim-governed cache. Resolution-independent,
  a few hundred bytes on disk, deterministic, and it sidesteps shipping
  megabytes of photographic tiling.
- **Repetition is broken by construction.** Material lookups are offset by a
  low-frequency rotation/scale jitter keyed on world position, so a large
  grassland does not visibly repeat.
- **Roads, rivers, and scars are decals in the weight field, not geometry.**
  A spline stamps its material weights with a soft falloff, so a road *wears
  into* the grass with frayed edges, a river bank grades through mud to
  shingle, and two roads meeting merge rather than overlap.
- **Shipped raster masters are legitimate only where artwork is a picture**
  (`AGENTS.md` §10): the loading art, item icons, and portraits are raster masters; all
  chrome is SVG; every material and every figure is procedural. Any shipped
  asset is decoded in a §19.5 sandbox under a fixed byte bound and falls back
  to a built-in tier — the game does not get its own decode path
  (`plans/ICONS.md`).

### What WS4 settled

The palette, the material set, the splat kernel, the decal stamp and the
particle vocabulary are built, in `wintersun/art`. What a later item needs to
know:

- **The crate contains no floating point at all**, and
  `deny(clippy::float_arithmetic)` makes that a compile error. Value noise,
  smoothstep, the blend, distance-to-segment and particle advection are all
  shifts, masks, byte-wide weighted means and one exact integer square root.
  So bit-identity across targets **follows from the language** rather than
  from a test, and this crate therefore carries **no four-target QEMU
  vertical** where WS2 and WS3 each carry one — four emulated machines would
  be confirming Rust's integer semantics, not the code.
  `digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST` exists for a digest's other job (an unintended
  change to the art shows up as a moved number) and **WS5's client frame
  vertical folds it in**, which is where the cross-target rendering claim
  belongs: over a whole composited frame, not one crate.

  **Two things WS5 owes this crate**, because nothing consumes it yet and so
  nothing in the gate reaches it beyond the host suite, the proptest model and
  clippy: the client vertical **folds `digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST` in**, and it
  is what first pulls `wintersun/art` into a build for each Tier-1 target.
  All four targets were confirmed to build at WS4
  (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`, `aarch64-unknown-none`,
  `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`, `x86_64-unknown-none`), but by hand rather
  than by the gate, and a hand check does not stay true.
- **The weight field is one mechanism with one mutation.**
  `WeightField::cover` is the *over* operator on a weight vector, and
  everything that changes the ground goes through it: road and river decals
  now, WS13's snow accumulation and WS9/WS10's scorch marks later. Covering
  takes the maximum rather than the sum, which is exactly what makes two
  roads merge — a second stamp at the same coverage is a no-op — and a stamp
  lighter than every material already on a full field is refused rather than
  displacing something heavier.
- **A span is the unit, not a pixel.** Everything a pixel needs beyond its
  own texel read is linear along a horizontal run inside one cell row, so a
  caller does the *vertical* interpolation (one `WeightField::lerp` per cell
  row per raster row) and `splat::splat` steps the horizontal. That turns
  four hash evaluations per pixel into four per span, and it is what the
  budget assumes.
- **Resolution is total, so the pass never fails.** A tile the cache will not
  admit degrades to a coarser mip and then to the material's flat mid tone at
  its standing height. `MaterialCache::ensure` reports residency and
  `peek` reads it, deliberately as two calls: a splat needs four tiles at
  once and four live borrows cannot come out of four mutable calls — and it
  is the ask-then-paint shape an interactive loop wants anyway.
- **Two detail knobs exist here.** Particle density is `area / pressure
  band`, and `material::Quality` is the octave count that is also the tile
  cache's generation token. The octaves are a player's ground-texture setting
  and never a rung `auto` turns: they cost a synthesis, not a frame.
- **No `lib/cpuops` family yet, deliberately.** A family with one portable
  candidate selects nothing, and reaching for per-architecture intrinsics
  before a measurement says the portable kernel misses its budget is the
  speculative optimisation the charter forbids. The measurement is M1's exit
  criterion. The kernel is already shaped as the contiguous span function such
  a candidate would replace, so adding one later is adding a candidate, not a
  reshape.
- **No fuzz target, because there is no decoder.** Material rows are compiled
  in, weight fields come from the generator's own output, and a decal path is
  either that generator's road or a player-caused change `wintersun/net`
  already bounds-checks and fuzzes. The adversarial coverage is the proptest
  model, enrolled as `wintersun-art`.
- **A material's standing height is an art-direction statement**, because the
  relief is what decides which material wins a shared pixel: rock above
  gravel above sand above water, glacier above snowfield. A river bank grades
  through mud to shingle because shingle stands higher, not because anything
  special-cases a bank.
- **`lib/raster::shape` (FG1) was not needed by WS4 or WS5.** Decals are
  polylines stamping weights and particles are points; neither wants an
  outline primitive. It is built now, as WS6's prerequisite.

### What WS5 settled

The client shell is built, in `wintersun/app`: the `[lib]` holds the camera,
the ladder, the render target, the terrain lattice and its splat, the light,
the tiled frame, the pacing, the input drain, the size-state model, the budget
governor and the frame digest; the `[[bin]]` is the bundle's `Run` and only
composes them. What a later item needs to know:

- **The frame budget was measured, and it holds on the reference machine.**
  At 1280×720 on four threads: terrain **4.1 ms** against its 5.0 ms
  allocation (81%), light **1.7 ms** against 2.0 ms (87%), 5.8 ms of drawing
  in a 16.6 ms frame, a 3.49× speedup over one thread. The number this plan
  called "the single most likely to be wrong" is right. `tests/budget.rs` is
  the measurement and prints it, and asserts no elapsed time: a wall-clock
  bound is a claim about the machine and what else is running on it, so what
  the test gates is that real threads draw the picture one thread does. On a
  slower development host the same frame costs more per pass — the light
  pass most, at 1.3 to 2.5 times its allocation — which is the figure to
  re-measure whenever the reference machine changes.
  - **Three output-identical optimisations have already been taken**, so
    they are not re-derived: `FastHash::hash_bytes` is `#[inline]` (the
    noise lattice hashes a fixed 16-byte key, and folding the length at the
    call site removes the slice walk — the hash was ~18% of the whole
    profile); the blend's three per-pixel channel divisions are an exact
    reciprocal table over the bounded divisor, proven exhaustively by
    `reciprocals_are_exact`; and `shade` skips the texel fetch for any slot
    whose weight is too far under the heaviest to reach the blend floor
    however tall its relief, proven by
    `a_skipped_slot_could_not_have_reached_the_floor`. The light pass's
    composite walks texel-wide runs instead of dividing per pixel. What
    remains is the noise: the warp's four lattice corners are re-hashed per
    span, and adjacent spans in a row share a warp cell, so memoising the
    corners is the next real gain and the one that needs a design — the
    field is read through `&Warp` from every worker.
  - The light pass was **53% over budget** on its first measurement, entirely
    because its buffer was shaded on the calling thread while only the
    composite was distributed. Shading its texel rows through the same runner
    brought it to 87%. That is the whole reason the measurement exists.
- **A tile is a full-width band of rows**, not a square. Every pass steps
  horizontally — the splat walks a span inside one cell row, the composite
  walks a row of the buffer — so a vertical cut would divide the unit each is
  built around. The per-tile bucketing a later item does is unaffected.
- **The camera clamps where the view is projected, not where it is aimed**,
  and carries the realm's extent to do it with. Clamping on being aimed is
  correct until the window grows, at which point the wider view reaches past
  an edge the camera had already settled against. The proptest model found it;
  `look_at` now records a wish and `centre(w, h)` settles it.
- **Shading is relative to the palette.** A slope facing neither way draws the
  material's own colour. A plain multiply by a tint darkens every surface in
  the world by whatever the tint's mid-point is, which is a palette change
  wearing lighting's clothes. The relief term saturates at
  `MAX_STEP_RISE_SUB_UNITS` — the rules' own slope/cliff line — so ground a
  player can walk over is shaded across its whole range.
- **The ladder's shadow rung is shadow softness, across the frame.** Its first
  notch hardens every shadow edge at once — each figure's contact shadow to
  one ellipse, the relief term to a one-cell stencil — and its second drops
  the relief term. The wider stencil is both the penumbra and the dearer, so
  narrowing it before dropping the term is the right order either way.
- **A paint reads nothing.** Chunk generation is handed to a worker through
  the shared deferral desk; the frame draws the ground that has arrived and
  marks the rest. The desk holds one request, which is the right policy: the
  nearest missing chunk is always the best thing to be solving, and a
  displaced ask is simply re-made next frame. No chunk supersedes another,
  so an ask made while a solve is in flight is declined rather than allowed
  to discard it (`terrain::ChunkDesk`). Otherwise every solve longer than a
  frame would be thrown away and repeated.
- **The two debts to WS4 are paid.** The client vertical folds
  `tairix_wintersun_art::digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST` in, and
  `client_frame_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}` plus `client_frame_wasm32` are
  what first build the ground art for each Tier-1 target — by the gate, not by
  hand.
- **`lib/raster` gained `pixels_mut` and `resample_into`.** The renderer
  writes the window's own pixels at native scale rather than composing a frame
  and copying it, and resamples into a destination the caller holds rather
  than allocating a screen-sized surface per frame on the path a machine
  reaches precisely because it is short of time.
- **`world::chunk::ChunkWindow` is the one sorted-window lookup**, hoisted out
  of `rules::ChunkTerrain`, which now wraps it. The client needs a chunk's
  blend and the simulation needs its heights; both were binary-searching the
  same slice the same way.
- **The library takes `tairix-parallel` with `default-features = false`**, as
  `lib/raster` does: the pool creates threads through `lib/rt`, which brings a
  global allocator and a panic handler, and a bare-metal *consumer* of the
  library — each of the four verticals — supplies both itself. The binary's
  runtime sits behind the default `run` feature for the same reason.
- **Still no `lib/cpuops` family.** The portable kernel makes its budget, so
  adding per-architecture candidates now would be the speculative optimisation
  the charter forbids. The splat is still shaped as the contiguous span
  function such a candidate would replace.
- **No fuzz target**, for WS4's reason: the client decodes nothing untrusted.
  Its adversarial coverage is the proptest model, enrolled as `wintersun-app`.
- **What WS5 deliberately does not draw**: figures (WS6), particles and
  weather (WS13), the console and chat (WS15/WS16). The frame's pass order and
  the budget name them now so each lands in a place that is already measured.
  The camera follows an ordinary `rules` entity walking real collision ground,
  so the body is there before the art for it is.

### Lighting, and why the name matters

WinterSun is lit by a low sun. That is an art direction and a rendering
simplification at once: a single directional light at a shallow angle gives
long directional shadows, strong rim light on north faces, and a cold-to-warm
gradient across a slope, all of which read at the game's distance and all of
which are cheap. Terrain is shaded by its slope normal against the sun; entities and
scenery cast soft projected contact shadows squashed along the light direction
(the readable-jump trick `cinder` already uses). Night is the same pass with a
moon and point lights from lanterns, fires, and spell effects, accumulated into
a light buffer at half resolution and upsampled.

### The frame

A tiled, threaded software renderer. The visible area is split into
full-width bands of rows, each a job on `lib/parallel`, and the passes are
terrain splat with its decals → light/fog composite → ground scenery and
entities depth-sorted by ground y → overhead canopy → particles → weather →
UI. Scenery and entities come *after* the light: the light buffer is the
ground's own relief shading, and a figure standing on a slope is neither
tilted with it nor lit by it — it is already shaded from its own surfaces by
the same sun — so what it takes from the ground is the fog at its feet, as a
veil over its every stroke. Each band draws only the figures whose rows reach
it.

Per §28: input is drained, then the frame is produced once from the state the
events left. The simulation runs at a fixed tick; the render interpolates
between the last two authoritative states, so motion is smooth at any display
rate and the sim rate is not a visual property.

### The frame budget, in numbers

"Playable" is not a budget, and a renderer without one cannot be reviewed. The
baseline target is **1280×720 at 60 Hz — a 16.6 ms frame — on a four-core
reference machine**, with the per-pass allocation below. These are budgets to
be *measured* at M1, and a blown budget is a defect fixed or reverted in the
same change, exactly like a failed test (§2.16).

**From WS32's 3D view on, the budget is the GPU path's to hold.** A 3D scene
is more work than a CPU does in 16.6 ms, and a GPU does it faster, so the
software path is not failed against the table below. It is held instead to
being as fast as the CPU allows: SIMD kernels selected through `lib/cpuops` on
every hot stage, every core through `lib/parallel`, its frame time measured
per pass and recorded, and a regression in it treated as a defect. The ladder
still sheds on it, so the game stays playable at whatever rate the machine
gives.

| Pass | Budget |
|---|---|
| Terrain splat (material blend + detail) | 5.0 ms |
| Ground decals, scenery, entities and figures | 3.5 ms |
| Particles and weather | 2.0 ms |
| Light, fog and atmosphere composite | 2.0 ms |
| UI and overlays | 1.0 ms |
| Headroom (present, input, jitter) | 3.1 ms |

Concurrent budgets: ≤256 visible entities, of which ≤64 carry a full rig; the
simulation runs on its own cadence and is **not** inside the frame budget.

**A new install draws every detail at its finest, and `auto` is the player's
to choose.** On `auto` the renderer sheds, when frames run late for long
enough, in this sequence and no other: light-buffer resolution → shadow softness
→ render scale (with upscale to the window) — the knobs that cost frame time,
one notch at a time. The order is fixed so degradation is reproducible and
reviewable rather than an emergent surprise, and the active step is observable
for diagnosis. The ground's octaves are not on it: they cost a synthesis, not a
frame. `auto` reads the machine over seconds rather than frames, so a moment of
other work sheds nothing and a larger window does not send it to the bottom;
the frame rate gives way for the seconds it takes to answer a real change.
A window larger than the software path can fill is drawn at up to 2560×1440
and upscaled.

**`auto` never sheds a detail the player needs to read.** The ladder has a
floor, and the floor is the last notch whose frame still passes the
readability checks `plans/FIGURE.md` FG5 defines — the
silhouette coverage band, the landmark count, the contrast ratio — taken at the
figure's drawn size. Two rungs are pinned by it concretely: a contact shadow
stops at `Hard` and never reaches `Off`, because the shadow is what says where
a figure stands and whether it is airborne; and the render scale stops at the
coarsest fraction whose attack telegraphs and figure silhouettes still clear
the checks. The floor is therefore measured off the art rather than chosen
here, and it moves when the art does.

It is measured **once, at build time**, by the FG5 contact-sheet harness, which
renders the figure grid — authored and generated figures alike, and every
preset the game ships — at every drawn size, and compiled in as the ladder's
floor: the smallest side the harness proves its bounds at, and the reach of
the smallest figure a record describes. Nothing measures readability on a
frame: that would put the most expensive check in the project on the hot path
to decide whether the frame is too expensive.

Reaching the floor with the frame still over budget is **reported, not
hidden**: the frame rate gives way, the diagnostic names the floor as the
reason, and the player is told a forced level exists. A renderer that quietly
crossed the floor to hold 60 Hz would be trading away precisely what the player
needs to see in order to keep what they would not notice.

**A forced level is the player's own choice and holds regardless of frame
time** — that is the whole point of it — and it may go below the floor, because
they asked for it. There the frame rate is what gives way, by their decision
rather than the renderer's. The surface, its presets, and what the sliders
offer are WS18.

The frame digest folds a frame at each end of every knob (`Detail::FINEST`
and `Detail::PLAINEST`), so neither the governor nor a player's setting can
move the cross-target claim; adding a knob or a setting moves the plainest
detail and therefore the digest, which is the intended coupling rather than a
nuisance.

The honest risk: a 720p frame is 0.92 M pixels, and a terrain pixel touches
several material samples. The budget above assumes SIMD kernels selected
through `lib/cpuops` and tiles distributed over `lib/parallel`, and it is the
single most likely number in this plan to be wrong. That is precisely why M1
exists and why its exit criterion is this measurement.

### WS32 — the world in 3D

What stands now, and is this item's to change: the view is orthographic from
directly above (WS5's `Camera`). The relief exists only as light — a slope is
shaded, but a hill hides nothing behind it and a cliff reads as a dark patch —
and the fine relief has one character everywhere but for dunes where it is dry
and ridges in a mountain belt.

- **A perspective view across the land.** The camera looks at the character
  from a height and an angle the player sets (WS33), through a perspective
  projection. The terrain is drawn as its true surface: nearer ground hides
  farther ground, a hill has a far side, a valley falls away, a bank drops to
  its water.
  - The low sun and the distance fog read on the true surface, so a slope is
    lit as it is seen rather than as a map shades it.
- **Built to be accelerated.** The view is the stages a GPU runs, over the
  data a GPU holds, so `lib/gpu` takes it over without a redesign.
  - The terrain is a chunked triangle mesh with distance-based detail,
    transformed, clipped and depth-tested, then shaded per fragment by the
    material splat and the light. It is not a column raymarch or any other
    trick only a CPU can play, because triangles are what the hardware draws.
    Figures and scenery are meshes in the same passes.
  - A frame is described once — meshes, the material tiles and weight field
    as textures, the camera and the sun as uniforms — and either path executes
    it; neither holds scene logic the other lacks. The software path runs the
    stages on `lib/parallel` through `lib/raster`'s one scan converter, which
    gains the depth test rather than the game growing a second rasteriser
    (decision 6). The GPU path runs them as `plans/GPU.md` GP4's pinned
    pipelines (WS19, GP7).
  - Each stage is specified exactly — depth precision, sample positions, the
    blend — so the GPU's picture can be held to the software path's within a
    stated tolerance (M6), never bit for bit. Until the game is complete the
    software path need not match across targets either (decision 4): its SIMD
    kernels may use whatever each CPU offers, fused multiply-add included.
  - The GPU is never required (decision 6), but the frame budget is the GPU
    path's to hold: a GPU does this work faster than a CPU can, so the
    software path may run over it. The software path is still made as fast as
    the CPU allows — its hot stages are SIMD kernels selected through
    `lib/cpuops`, and every core draws through `lib/parallel` — and a
    regression in its measured frame time is a defect.
- **Terrain uneven after its biome.** The fine relief takes its character from
  the ground it is: rolling swells on grassland and savanna, frost hummocks on
  tundra, tussocks in a bog, broken rock above the treeline, gullies in
  badlands, dunes in sand, scree below a face. Wetlands, salt pans and
  floodplains lie near flat.
  - The character is chosen from the conditions the classifier reads —
    climate, rock, belt and drainage — before the fine relief is laid, never
    from the classification, which reads the fine relief's slope: a relief
    that followed its own biome would be a loop.
  - It stays a pure function of position under the same halo discipline, so a
    hummock is one hummock from either side of a seam.
- **Settlements are mostly flattened.** Villagers level the ground they build
  on, but not to a table: the structure stamp pulls a settlement toward its
  grade and keeps a stated share of the natural relief, so worked ground
  still reads as ground. Streets, plots and terraced slopes level further
  where they need to (WS30).
- **Figures and objects stand in the same view.** A figure's parts are
  already meshes carried in three dimensions and projected vertex by vertex,
  so they project through the scene's camera. A figure now grows as it nears
  the camera, so `plans/FIGURE.md`'s rule that a figure's size does not vary
  with depth changes in this item, and FG5's readability floor is measured
  over the distances the camera allows. Feet meet the relief they stand on:
  the per-foot terrain solve WS6 left for a view that draws relief
  (`plans/FIGURE.md` FG4) lands here. Scenery follows (WS27).
- **Nothing authoritative moves.** The rules already walk bodies over the
  heightfield and test each step against it; what changes is that the player
  sees the heights. Collision, the rules digest and the wire are unchanged.
- **Budget.** §3's frame budget binds the GPU path once WS19 lands, with the
  terrain pass's 5.0 ms covering the projected, textured heightfield. This item
  measures the software path per pass on a long view across broken ground at
  the lowest tilt WS33 allows, and records it as the baseline its regressions
  are judged against.
- **Tests.**
  - The frame description carries everything a pass draws: executing it twice
    from the same description gives the same picture, with no scene state read
    outside it.
  - Each biome's relief falls within its stated roughness band over the probe
    realms, and a settlement's interior within its flattened band.
  - A hill hides the ground behind it: a probe beyond a ridge draws the ridge.
  - Relief reads the same from either side of a seam.
  - The world and client digests move, and the client vertical (WS23) is
    redrawn.

### WS33 — the camera the player positions

- **Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse.** Moving across swings
  the camera around the character, and moving up or down tilts it, from a low
  angle across the land to straight down. Releasing the button leaves the
  camera where it was put. The wheel keeps the zoom stops, now distances from
  the character.
- **The camera never loses the character.** Where ground rises between them,
  the camera draws in until the character is in sight, and it never goes
  below the surface it looks over.
- **Walking follows the camera.** The movement keys walk relative to where the
  camera faces — forward walks away from it — and the client turns that into
  the world direction its intent carries, so the server sees the intents it
  sees now (decision 1).
- **§28 holds.** A drag changes the in-memory camera and asks for a paint; a
  burst of pointer motion produces one frame, and nothing is written while the
  button is held. If a drag must outrun the screen's edge, relative pointer
  motion is the seat's to provide (`plans/DISPLAY.md`), not this item's.
- **Documented.** The bundle's Help describes the control in every locale.
- **Tests.**
  - A drag across swings the camera round the character and a drag up tilts
    it, each by the motion's amount; releasing holds it.
  - The tilt clamps at both ends, and the camera never enters the ground.
  - Walking forward walks away from the camera at every heading.
  - A burst of pointer motion yields one frame.

### WS27 — scenery on screen, and solid

- **Scenery has its own crate.** Parametric scenery is drawn through
  `lib/raster::shape`, whose geometry is `f64` over `mathf`. That covers
  flora archetypes and species rows, rocks, deadwood, clutter, and later
  crossings, buildings, walls and cave formations.
  - `wintersun/art` is float-free by construction, so scenery lives in a new
    `wintersun/scenery` crate, as the figure engine lives in
    `wintersun/figure`. `AGENTS.md` §3 gains its entry in that change.
  - `Splat` has no shared compositor: the soft composite that draws it is
    `cinder`'s private `fur`. This item moves that composite into
    `lib/raster::shape`, band-capable, and `cinder` calls it.
    `plans/FIGURE.md` FG1 is updated in the same change.
- **Drawn in the 3D view.** Scenery stands in WS32's perspective view, seen
  from wherever the player has put the camera (WS33): a tree is its trunk
  and crown, lit by the low sun, with the long shadow that sun throws; a
  boulder is its lit form and shadow; a bush is a low mound. Every standing
  object casts the same contact shadow figures do, sized by its footprint and
  height class.
- **Rasterised once, blitted many times.** Each (kind, variant, size class,
  view band) is rasterised once into a `lib/reclaim`-governed sprite cache,
  the band quantising the camera's heading and tilt so a turning camera draws
  from a bounded set,
  with the material cache's ask-then-paint shape. Each instance is a blit
  with its light and veil. A sprite the cache will not admit degrades to a
  coarser rendering and then to a flat silhouette, so the pass never fails
  and never reads the world.
- **Wind moves canopies cheaply.** A crown sways by a per-instance shear at
  blit time, phased by position and driven by the one wind vector (WS13),
  rather than by a spring per tree.
- **One far-to-near list.** Ground-layer and low objects sort with figures by
  depth from the camera: the figures' `Stage` becomes a stage of standing
  things.
  Canopy draws in its own pass after them. A crown over a figure the player
  can see fades to a stated translucency and shows that figure's silhouette
  through it, so no canopy hides a player. The FG5 readability bands are
  measured with a figure under a crown.
- **Ground cover** draws in the terrain pass after the splat, each band
  stamping the decoration its cells name.
- **Budget and ladder.**
  - The canopy pass takes 0.6 ms from the headroom, leaving 2.5 ms.
  - Ground cover draws inside the terrain pass's 5.0 ms, and objects share
    the 3.5 ms scenery allocation with figures.
  - The allocations are the GPU path's (WS32). The software path is measured
    on a dense forest at the default zoom, and a regression is fixed or
    reverted in this item.
  - Ground-cover density becomes a detail knob and the ladder's first rung,
    ahead of the light buffer: it decorates, and says where nothing is. So
    `Ladder::MAX_STEP` moves, and the plainest detail the frame digest folds
    moves with it.
- **Solid where drawn.**
  - Each blocking object contributes a collision shape: a circle for a
    trunk, post or boulder; a capsule for a fence, hedge or wall; a convex
    footprint for a building.
  - The rules' terrain answers a static-obstacle query over a region from
    its owners (the ownership rule in §2), bucketed per chunk.
  - Movement becomes swept: a step is tested as a moving circle against
    each shape, with today's slide order. No body of any radius or speed
    passes through a thin fence.
  - Separation never pushes a body into an obstacle.
  - `Zone::spawn` already refuses a body the ground cannot hold
    (`Refusal::Unstandable`); the check widens to obstacles, and so does
    the client's `landfall` search.
  - All of it is integer, like the rest of the rules.
- **Tests.**
  - An object blocks movement exactly where it is drawn, sampled inside and
    outside every footprint.
  - No swept step tunnels any obstacle: a proptest over radius, speed and
    shape.
  - A spawn on an obstacle is refused.
  - The sprite cache degrades totally.
  - The canopy fade keeps the smallest figure readable.
  - The synthetic reference terrain gains posts and walls, so the rules
    digest moves. The client vertical (WS23) and the frame digest are
    re-drawn.

### WS13 — weather, sky, and the day/night cycle

Weather is **server-authoritative, seeded, and regional**. Fronts are moving
systems of pressure, moisture and temperature advanced on the tick over the
realm's map, so it can rain in one valley and be clear over the next ridge, and
every client in a region sees the same storm at the same tick. A client is sent
its region's weather state — cloud cover, precipitation kind and intensity,
wind vector, fog density, electrification, temperature — and interpolates it;
every transition is a ramp, never a switch, because weather that changes
instantly is the tell that it is decoration.

- **Sky.** Sun and moon altitude derive from the world clock (`Time64`, with
  day length a realm parameter), giving the gradient, the disc and its halo,
  the horizon haze, and a star field that rotates with the clock. WinterSun's
  low sun is the art direction: long shadows and a cold-to-warm slope gradient
  all day, which is what reads at the game's distance.
- **Clouds.** Two or three advected noise layers at different altitudes and
  speeds, so they parallax; lit by the sun's angle, so undersides darken as a
  front builds. Their shadows project onto the terrain as a moving multiply
  mask — cheap, and the single most convincing atmospheric cue available.
- **Precipitation.** Rain, sleet, snow and hail as depth-layered particle
  fields advected by the wind vector, streaks oriented to wind and camera
  motion, with the particle count derived from the visible area and the memory
  pressure band rather than a fixed constant (§24.1, §26.3). Drawing them is
  what gives particle density meaning as a detail knob, so this item adds it
  to `Detail`, to the settings window, and to the ladder as its first rung,
  ahead of ground-cover density — none of which carries a knob nothing draws.
- **Snow settles through the material system, not a new one.** Accumulation
  raises the snow material's weight in the splat field, so it covers ground
  through the same height-weighted blend everything else uses, drifts against
  obstacles, and melts on a temperature-driven timer. Reusing the splat field
  is why snow costs no second mechanism (§2.2).
- **Wetness reuses the hydrology.** Rain raises a wetness term that darkens and
  glosses the material blend and pools in hollows using the flow-accumulation
  field WS2 already computed — so puddles form where water would actually go.
- **Fog.** Distance and height fog composited in the light pass, ground mist
  pooling in hollows at dawn and heavier over marsh biomes.
- **Lightning.** A strike selects a ground point within an electrified region;
  the bolt is a jittered branching polyline; the flash raises scene luminance
  for a few frames. The flash is **intensity-capped and separately
  adjustable**, because an uncapped full-screen white flash is a
  photosensitivity hazard, not an effect (WS18). Thunder is queued as a sound
  delayed by the real speed of sound over the strike distance and low-passed by
  it (§9), which is the detail that makes a storm have depth.
- **One wind vector, consumed everywhere.** It drives cloth and hair springs,
  foliage sway, rain angle, particle advection, and the audio bed's character —
  one definition, never a per-consumer copy (§2.2).
- **Weather affects the rules, so it is not merely drawn.** Visibility narrows
  detection ranges, a blizzard drains warmth and stamina, lightning can strike
  a character, and heavy rain quenches fire effects. Because weather is
  authoritative and seeded, those effects are identical for every player and
  cannot be turned off by a client that dislikes them.

## 4. WS6 — characters

The figure engine is `plans/FIGURE.md` (P6); what the game adds is its own content:
humanoid and creature rigs, the species/archetype presets, the clip set (idle,
walk, run, dodge, melee light/heavy, draw/loose, cast/channel, hit, stagger,
fall, die, sit, swim, climb), and the state machine that selects and blends
them. The approach is `cinder`'s, generalised and proven: parametric parts on a
skeleton, pose parameters as data, one body frame so a single rig serves every
heading without per-direction sprite sets, and procedural layers (gait phase
from velocity, look-at, weapon recoil, cloth and hair sway, breathing) over the
authored clips.

Equipment is parts, not paint: a helm, a pauldron, a cloak, a blade are parts
attached to named sockets in the rig with their own palette, so a character's
gear is visible, mixable, and costs no new art path.

### What WS6 settled

Figures are on screen. The game-side animation lives in `wintersun/figure`
(`actor`, the `motion` set) and the drawing in `wintersun/app` (`figures`,
the frame's third pass). What a later item needs to know:

- **The ground a figure stands on is the ground drawn.** The world is drawn
  from directly above with height shown by shading alone, so a figure's feet
  meet a level plane everywhere; the per-foot terrain solve is for a view that
  draws relief (`plans/FIGURE.md` FG4). Standing water is the exception that
  shows: a wading figure stands on the bed, sunk by the depth the rules report
  at its cell (`figures::submerged`), and nothing of it is drawn below the
  surface.
- **Figures are drawn after the light composite** (§3, the frame), each
  veiled by the fog at its feet. A later item's point lights reach a figure
  the same way: read from the light buffer where it stands, not applied to
  its pixels as the ground's relief is.
- **The clip set is authored whole, on reference timings.** All seventeen §4
  clips ship. An action is authored across windup, active and recovery in
  phase and takes its seconds from outside (`clip::Timing`), so WS9–WS11's
  action documents set how long a blow takes without re-authoring its clip.
- **Locomotion is chosen, not blended.** The walk and the run have different
  stances, and a blend weighed by speed sank a planted foot half a unit and
  slid it by several between their paces. One gait plays at a time, chosen by
  speed with a margin either side of each change, paced by distance at its own
  fitted stride, and a change fades over a quarter of a second at the phase
  the two share. A test holds the planted foot still from a third of the
  walk's pace to over three times it.
- **The world scale is the figure's.** `actor::WORLD_SCALE` (24 world
  sub-units a figure unit) puts a reference figure a little over two cells
  tall, where the simulation's default pace runs at the run clip's own
  cadence. The player's collision radius is its figure's footprint, so the
  rules and the picture agree on how wide a body is.
- **One sun.** `reference::SUN_TOWARD` and `SUN_ELEVATION` are the light the
  harness measures figures under, and `light::Sun::light` builds the game's
  figure light from the ground sun's own direction.
- **The ladder has its floor.** `Ladder::floor` is the deepest step still
  drawing the smallest figure a record describes at the harness's floor side
  (`actor::readable`, from `humanoid::LEAST_REACH` and `reference::SIDES[0]`),
  held before every frame (`Governor::hold`) and reported once when frames
  overrun there. At the default zoom every render scale stays readable; at the
  furthest the render scale never moves. Render scales step whole — 4/5, 2/3
  and 1/2, under window caps of 1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 — because a fraction
  that split a sub-unit made the view cover a different piece of the world,
  a zoom rather than a degradation.
- **The presets are the ten records in `app/Resources/`**, each measured by
  the harness in every motion at the floor. The player walks as
  `presets::DEFAULT`, read once before the window opens (`CAP_FS_ACCESS`),
  and as the reference figure — with the reason stated — where it cannot be
  read.
- **The player starts on dry ground with room to walk** (`landfall`). The
  chunks holding the dry coarse samples nearest the realm's centre are
  solved in turn, up to `TRIES`, and each chunk's cells are joined into
  walkable stretches by the rules' own step test taken both ways — a drop is
  legal and the climb back is not. The start is the dry cell nearest the
  centre of a stretch holding at least a quarter of its chunk, with no water
  under the body's footprint; failing any that large, the roomiest found. The
  centre itself is often sea, a lake, or a river bed between cliff banks, and
  a start searched out from the coarse sample's cell — which is where every
  channel is carved — once began nearly half of all sessions in one.
- **The figure pass is measured with the budget's sixty-four rigs.** On the
  development host, at 1280×720 on four threads: terrain 4.7 ms (94%), light
  2.6 ms (131%), figures 2.2 ms against their 3.5 ms (62%), 9.5 ms of drawing
  in the 16.6 ms frame. Every shape fill reuses a `lib/raster::ScanScratch`
  held per band, since allocating its scan buffers on the process's one heap
  would serialise the bands. Placing a figure costs about 21 µs on one core
  over WS22's maths, a fifth of what the figure costs; painting is the rest.
- **Input is drained before a frame**, so a burst of events is one paint, and
  **a minimized window stops** its clock and its frames until it is shown
  again. Frames fall due on a fixed beat (`pacing::Cadence`), so a wake
  between them — the settings window's included — draws nothing.
- **The ground held is the view's working set.** A chunk is some hundred
  kibibytes, and the client kept every one it had generated; it now gives
  back any the view and a one-chunk margin no longer need
  (`terrain::worth_holding`), so walking the realm no longer grows it.
- **The client digest draws figures.** Five of them — every species, a walk
  and a run, both action layers, a figure in the air and one wading — stand in
  both reference frames.
- **Open: no seat notice reaches a window application.** §10's pause on a fast
  user switch needs one, but `plans/NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` G5 has a
  backgrounded session keep its applications running with nothing said to
  them. `Shell` models the seat and the property model drives it; the client
  has nothing to feed it from. Deciding who tells an application its seat has
  gone — and in what form — is the display and login plans' call.
- **M1's picture is shown end to end** (WS23). `wintersun_client_qemu_aarch64`
  launches the installed bundle by name from a terminal on the reference
  scene and reads its window back as it opened, fullscreen, restored and
  maximised, each compared pixel for pixel with the scene drawn on the host at
  the extent the window manager gives it. What M1 still lacks is its budget:
  the light pass is over its allocation (§3), and fullscreen's single-layer
  promotion is reached only once P9 lands (WS24).

### What WS22 settled

Decision 4 rests on `lib/util::mathf`, which WS22 made faster with every
target still agreeing to the bit. What a later item needs to know:

- **The square root and integer rounding are the toolchain's.** `sqrt`,
  `floor` and `ceil` call `core::f64::math`, which is `fsqrt` on `aarch64`,
  `fsqrt.d` on `riscv64`, `f64.sqrt` on `wasm32` and `sqrtsd` on `x86_64`,
  whose SSE2 baseline has no rounding instruction, so `floor` and `ceil` there
  call compiler-builtins' correctly rounded routine. IEEE 754 fixes one
  answer for each, and a host test holds `sqrt` bit-equal to the host's own
  across the whole positive range. They sit behind `core_float_math` until
  stable as inherent methods, when the calls become `x.sqrt()`, `x.floor()`
  and `x.ceil()` and the gate goes.
- **The transcendentals are fdlibm's**, in one fixed order with no fused
  multiply-add: `__rem_pio2`'s quarter-turn reduction feeding `__kernel_sin`
  and `__kernel_cos`, the four-interval `atan`, and the rational `exp` with
  one division. Each is within an ulp of the true value; the tangent, their
  quotient, within three. The reduction takes up to three parts of `PI/2` as
  the earlier ones cancel, so beside a quarter turn the tiny remainder is
  still exact to its own last bit, where one part alone is off by millions
  of ulps; a test holds sine and cosine bit-equal to a correctly rounded libm
  there. Past 2^20 quarter turns (1.6 million radians) Payne and Hanek's
  reduction takes over, in integers, so every finite angle reduces exactly.
- **`round` decides on the exact fraction.** `floor(x + 0.5)` rounds the sum
  first, which takes `0.49999999999999994`, and every odd integer past 2^52,
  up by one.
- **A heading along an axis is exactly that axis.** `Facing::unit_vector`
  takes whole quarter turns in integers. `PI` has no exact double, so an
  accurate sine of the nearest one is `1.2e-16` rather than zero, and a
  west-facing figure's same-side surfaces would sort by that residue instead
  of the order they were authored in. The heading is worked out once per
  figure (`frame::Heading`), not per projected point.
- **Measured and left alone.** `fabs` stays a comparison: a hardware `abs`
  measured 0.9× per call, too little to pay for a pure one-line wrapper or a
  migration of its 182 callers. A paired `sin_cos` measured slower than
  inlined `sin` and `cos`, which already share their reduction. `fmin` and
  `fmax` stay comparisons because IEEE leaves the sign of `min(-0, +0)` open
  and the targets lower it differently.
- **What each digest is taken over.** The figure and client-frame digests
  fold raw bits and drawn figures, so their constants are the values all four
  targets produce over this maths, as the art ledger's pixel digests are. The
  world digest folds quantised integers, the rules make no `mathf` call and
  the art crate has no float, so theirs do not depend on it.
- **`x86_64` computes in hardware float** in kernel and user space alike, and
  the three determinism verticals hold it to the same digests as the other
  targets.

## 5. WS3/WS9/WS10/WS11/WS21 — the simulation and the rules

### The tick

The authoritative step is fixed-rate (**30 Hz default**, a realm parameter) and
total: it consumes validated intents, advances every entity, resolves
interactions in a fixed order, and emits the deltas. Order is deterministic and
documented; "whatever order the map iterated" is a defect. Movement is
validated against the mover's own speed and the collision field, so a client
claiming an impossible step is corrected, not believed.

30 Hz rather than 20 because this is an action RPG with dodges and aimed
shots: a 20 Hz tick quantises every input to 50 ms, which is enough to make a
dodge feel unreliable in a way no amount of client-side polish hides. **An
intent additionally carries the client's sub-tick sample time**, so the server
places an action *within* the tick it arrived in rather than snapping it to the
boundary — recovering most of the remaining granularity for the cost of one
field.

### What WS3 settled

The tick, the collision field, the broad phase, the stat curves, the damage
pipeline and the status vocabulary are built, in `wintersun/rules`. What a
later item needs to know:

- **The step order above is fixed and documented on `Zone::step`.** Bodies
  are iterated in identity order out of an array kept sorted by an identity
  the zone mints monotonically; nothing reads a hash order anywhere.
- **A spawn obeys the step's rule.** `Zone::spawn` takes the terrain and
  refuses, with `Refusal::Unstandable` and before anything changes, a body
  whose footprint `motion::footprint_clear` would not admit. A body placed
  in deep water or against a cliff could never move.
- **The simulation is integer arithmetic throughout but for one heading
  conversion** (`Facing::towards`, which went into `wintersun/net` beside
  `unit_vector` for the same reason that one did). Movement is fixed-point
  with a carried remainder per body, separation is an exact integer square
  root. Anything folded into the digest has a fixed width, never `usize`,
  whose four bytes on `wasm32` would otherwise put the host's pointer size in
  the answer. Reaching for `f64` in an authoritative path is a defect.
- **The claim is staked on `digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST`**, a scripted session
  folded tick by tick — not a final state, so a divergence that later
  converges is still caught. Asserted by the host suite and by
  `tests/integration/rules_determinism_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}` and
  `rules_determinism_wasm32`. It is a *separate* constant from WS2's, and the
  session walks a pattern rather than a generated realm, so a change to
  either cannot make the other's evidence ambiguous.
- **The collision seam is a data source, not a policy.** `Terrain` answers
  ground height and water height per cell; the passability rules live in the
  crate. Fetching chunks is a cache with a budget and belongs to the process
  holding it, so `ChunkTerrain` borrows a sorted window and owns no cache.
  Absent ground reads as impassable.
- **A root or a stun works through the speed, never by refusing the input.**
  Refusing would leave a stale held direction to resume when it expired, so a
  body that changed its mind while held would walk the old way. Discrete
  actions a stun or a silence forbids *are* refused, with the reason.
- **An intent naming an action, spell, item or interaction is refused as
  unresolvable**, because no table exists to resolve one. That is the final
  code path, not a placeholder: WS9–WS11 add the tables the same lookup will
  then find. The damage, healing, status and resource verbs those items will
  call are built and tested on `Zone`.
- **Bounds are fixed ranges rules are defined over, not capacities.** They
  also bound every product the pipelines form, which is what lets the whole
  simulation run in checked integer arithmetic with no saturating step hiding
  a real overflow. Entity, event and refusal storage grows on demand and
  fails closed as a typed error.
- **`lib/parallel` is still not wired here.** A tick's phases are sequential
  by dependency and its bodies share one table; the parallelism worth having
  is over zones and over chunks, which is WS5's and WS8's composition.

### Combat (WS9)

Stats are a small closed set with documented curves. Damage is
`base → attacker modifiers → defence and resistance → status interaction →
floor`, each step a pure function with its own test, and the whole pipeline
host-tested against hand-computed cases. Melee is a swing arc resolved against
capsules; ranged is a projectile with real flight (speed, gravity where it
applies, and a per-tick swept test), server-resolved and client-predicted for
the shooter's own shots only. Traps are entities with a trigger volume, an
owner, a detection difficulty, and an arm/disarm state; an undetected trap is
not sent to the client that has not detected it (decision 3).

Archetypes — the "player types" — are data: a stat curve, a starting skill
tree, gear and school permissions, and a resource model (stamina, mana, focus,
or a pair). Adding one is a document plus its tests.

### Magic (WS10)

A spell is a declarative document: school, cost, cast time, whether it is
instant, cast-then-release, or channelled; its shape (self, touch, projectile,
cone, circle, line, aura); its targeting rules; its effect list; and its visual
and audio descriptors. Effects come from the closed vocabulary — damage, heal,
resource change, status apply/remove, displacement, summon, terrain or material
change, light, reveal — each with a rule and a test. Interruption, line of
sight, friendly fire, and diminishing returns on repeated status application
are rules, not per-spell code.

Visual effects compose from the same particle and decal vocabulary as weather:
a frost spell lays a real ice material decal that the terrain splat then
blends, and it melts on a timer. That is why effects sit in `art` beside
materials rather than in a separate effects system.

### Game feel — the part that decides whether it is any good (WS9–WS11)

A correct combat simulation that feels mushy is a failed action RPG, and feel
is not something that can be added afterwards: it lives in the same numbers the
server enforces. So it is specified here, in data, and tested.

- **Every action is windup / active / recovery, authored as frames.** An
  action document states the three durations, and **the animation clip's timing
  is derived from them** rather than authored beside them — so tuning a number
  changes the feel and the visuals together and they cannot drift apart. A clip
  whose length disagrees with its action is refused at load.
- **Animation events drive the simulation, not the reverse.** A clip carries
  named events at phases — `footstep`, `hit_frame`, `loose`, `cast_release` —
  and the hitbox activates, the arrow leaves, and the sound plays on the frame
  the art shows it happening. This is what stops the common defect where a
  sword connects visually a hundred milliseconds after the damage landed.
- **Hitstop, and why it is presentation-only.** On a landed hit both parties
  hold for a few frames; it is the cheapest and most effective impact cue there
  is. It is applied **only** on the client, to the visual: the authoritative
  simulation never pauses, because a sim that stalls on a hit would diverge
  between two clients watching the same fight. Feel effects that would change
  the simulation are refused by that rule, not by case-by-case judgement.
- **A hit is a chord, not a number.** Hitstop, a brief flash, knockback along
  the hit normal, a particle burst, a directional sound, and a damage figure —
  layered, and each scaled by the hit's weight so a light jab and a heavy
  overhead do not read the same. Screen shake is capped and disabled under
  reduced motion (WS18).
- **Input buffering and grace windows, as stated numbers.** An action pressed
  during the previous action's recovery is buffered for a bounded window and
  fires on exit, so combos are rhythmic rather than twitchy. A dodge accepted
  slightly after a landing, and an ability accepted slightly before a cooldown
  ends, both within stated bounds. The server enforces the same bounds, so
  generosity is a rule rather than a client-side lie.
- **Cancels are a validated table.** Which action states may be cancelled into
  which, as data checked at load — so a designer tunes the combat's fluidity
  without touching code and cannot author an unreachable or infinitely
  cancellable state.
- **Enemy intent is legible.** A windup holds a readable pose and an area
  attack lays a ground decal for its shape during the windup. In a game with
  ranged attackers and traps, an unreadable threat is not difficulty,
  it is unfairness, and players correctly read it as a bug.
- **It is tested, not eyeballed.** Host tests assert an action's event phases
  land at their authored frames, that the buffer and grace windows accept and
  reject at their boundaries, that no cancel edge escapes the table, and that a
  hit's presentation chord fires exactly once per landed hit. The M4 exit
  criterion requires this at a simulated 100 ms round trip, because feel that
  only exists on a loopback connection is not feel.

### Progression and the action bar (WS11)

XP curves, skill trees (a DAG validated at load — acyclic, reachable, and its
point budget consistent, or the document is refused), item affixes, and
equipment slots. The action bar is a configurable set of slots bound to items,
spells, or abilities, per character, with keyboard and pointer activation and a
binding editor; bindings resolve through `lib/keymap` so they respect the
user's layout. Slot count and layout are the player's, stored per character.

### NPC conversation (WS21)

A player can type anything to an inhabitant, and it answers in character, from
what it truly knows, with the effects the rules allow. There is no language
model (§14): understanding is classification into a closed set, knowledge is a
query over the realm, and speech is authored grammar. A turn's budget is well
under a millisecond and a locale's model a few megabytes, both measured like
the frame's.

- **Talking is its own message.** `Chat` stays never interpreted (§10). A
  `Talk` names the NPC, the locale it is written in, and either free text
  under its own byte bound or one of the choices the NPC's last line offered;
  a choice not offered is refused, as is an NPC out of earshot and a rate over
  the account's limit. The tick a `Talk` is applied in is recorded in the
  intent log, so a conversation replays line for line and effect for effect
  (§12). A player's words are never relayed: chat stays the only path by which
  one player's text reaches another. The NPC you are talking to joins §7's
  crowding priority beside an engaged combatant.
- **A speaker is a WS20 person plus a temperament** — warmth, formality,
  verbosity, humour, candour, patience — generated from the secret seed like
  the rest of them, with the knowledge scope and the secrets its trade and
  household imply.
- **Understanding maps free text to a closed set, never to meaning, and runs
  in a sandbox.** Reading a player's text is parsing untrusted input, so it
  happens in a §19.5 worker holding the trained models and the realm's names,
  with one endpoint to the zone and nothing else. It answers with an act, a
  confidence, and the names and pointing words it found; the zone keeps the
  names the speaker could mean. A `Talk` is understood off the tick and
  applied at the tick its answer arrives. The zone validates that answer like
  any input — an act outside the set or a name it does not know is refused —
  so a subverted worker can spoil a conversation and reach nothing else; a
  fault costs one conversation rather than a region's live state, and the
  worker is replaced and the fault logged. The understander is total over any
  bytes, bounded, panic-free and fuzzed, as are the `Talk` and `Speech`
  decoders.
  - *Normalisation* is Unicode's `NFKC_Casefold` plus a locale's own folding
    (the optional vowel marks of Arabic and Hebrew). The tree has neither.
    Both are compiled from the vendored Unicode Character Database, as
    `tools/tzcompile` compiles IANA's rules, and live in `talk` until an OS
    consumer wants them.
  - *Names* — places and people (WS20), items, kin — match as the player's
    locale spells them, within a small edit distance, through an index built
    at load rather than a scan. Pointing words ("here", "you", "the river")
    resolve against the scene and a pronoun against the last subject named; a
    name that fits more than one thing is asked about, in character.
  - *The act* — greet, ask the way, trade, haggle, flatter, insult, threaten,
    agree, refuse, "why?", farewell and the rest — comes from character
    n-grams hashed into a linear model with integer weights. Character
    n-grams need no word segmenter, which is what makes Japanese and Chinese
    tractable without one, and a typo disturbs only the few that overlap it.
    The act set is content: each act is a phrase set per locale, en-US
    canonical and required. A worker trains when the content loads, by
    integer averaged perceptron, so every worker on every target derives the
    same weights from the same documents, the phrases are the only source,
    and a content reload retrains. The margin between the best act and the
    next is the confidence; under the content's threshold the act is
    `unclear`.
- **Knowing is a closed vocabulary of queries over the realm.** An NPC answers
  from what is true: the world (names, roads and their distances, rivers and
  fords, landmarks), its region's weather (WS13), its own trade and prices
  (WS12), its household and neighbours, what it remembers of the character,
  what anyone can see of the character, and the tidings its settlement has
  heard. Its scope follows trade and home — a trader knows the roads between
  towns, a farmer its valley.
  - No query reads a concealed fact (decision 3) or another player's live
    state, so a leak cannot even be phrased. An NPC tells one of its own
    secrets only through a rule that names the telling as its effect. A secret
    written into a shipped document is readable by anyone holding the bundle;
    one that must hold is generated from the secret seed.
  - **Tidings** are notable events — a named beast killed, a caravan robbed, a
    landmark opened — recorded once, with where and when. News travels the
    road network at a stated speed, so whether a settlement has heard it is a
    pure function of the event, the roads and the clock: rumour costs
    O(tidings), not O(tidings × people). It fades with distance and age, and
    each road it travels may distort one detail, deterministically — NPCs that
    misremember, after Ryan et al., "Toward Characters Who Observe, Tell,
    Misremember, and Lie" (2015). Whether a given NPC repeats it is its
    temperament.
  - **A tiding never locates a player.** One about a character is only ever of
    a public deed, is placed at the nearest settlement rather than a position,
    travels at road speed, and names the character only if its player allows
    it — otherwise it is told of a stranger. Asking around must not reopen the
    radar interest management closes.
  - **Acquaintance** is per NPC and character: a disposition, a few remembered
    facts, and when they last met — bounded, fading, stored (§8). The only
    name an NPC can learn is the character's own, which is already a validated
    identity: it never stores or repeats anything a player typed.
- **Deciding is a rule base where the most specific match wins** — Valve's
  response rules (Ruskin, GDC 2012). The facts are the act and its subjects,
  the speaker's trade, temperament, mood and disposition, the hour, the place,
  the weather, and the conversation's state: the last line, the topic, the
  choices on offer. The rule matching the most facts answers, so layering
  falls out of specificity — common rules, then a trade's, then a
  temperament's, then any written for one person. Rules are indexed by act,
  so a turn weighs only those that answer it. An NPC may speak first — a
  greeting to a character who comes near — through the same rules, with the
  approach as the act.
  - Equally specific variants of one response are drawn by a stream keyed on
    the secret seed, the speaker and the tick, so replay repeats the draw. Two
    rules with different effects that could match the same facts at equal
    specificity are refused at load, as an unbroken bind tie is (§18.3). Rules
    can co-match only where every fact both constrain has overlapping
    constraints, so the test is sound: it may refuse a pair that could never
    meet, and never passes one that can.
  - A line declares the replies it expects — "why?", "how far?", "yes" — which
    match only while it is the last line. Most of a conversation's apparent
    coherence is these short replies resolved against what was just said.
  - Effects are decision 5's closed vocabulary: shift disposition, remember,
    mark a place discovered on the character's map (§8), open trade (WS12),
    give or take an item (WS11), pay or charge — a faucet or sink typed in the
    ledger and bounded like any other (§6) — refuse service for a while, and
    end the conversation. A shift per exchange is bounded and repeats
    diminish, so flattery on a loop earns nothing. There is no quest verb
    until an item builds quests (§16).
  - A character holds one conversation at a time, kept in the zone while it
    lasts, so conversation state is bounded by the zone's population. It ends
    on farewell, distance or idleness.
- **Saying keeps voice apart from content.** A response is a line and its slot
  values — places, people, items, numbers — and leaves the server as that
  structure, the choices it offers, and a render seed. Each receiving client
  words it in its own locale, so onlookers in different locales each read it
  in theirs.
  - Wording is tagged grammar expansion: the expansion whose tags best fit the
    speaker's voice — its warmth, formality, verbosity and humour, and the
    region it is from — wins, so a boreal trapper and a saltmarsh fisher state
    one fact differently. A voice is public, since anyone near can hear it,
    and joins the speaker's entity on the wire; candour, patience and secrets
    never leave the server.
  - Grammars are acyclic, so every expansion is finite, and the longest is
    computed at load and held to the line bound. Slots go through WS18's one
    per-locale formatter; a line missing in a locale falls back as every string
    does.
  - Nothing a player typed is ever echoed. Every word an NPC says is composed
    from reviewed parts.
- **Staying in character is the design, not the fallback.** `unclear` is
  answered by the speaker's own deflections, which steer back to what it can
  talk about: a misparse played as character reads as personality, which is
  Façade's lesson (Mateas and Stern, 2005). Every line offers the topics it
  mentioned as choices, which need no understanding, so all a conversation can
  reach stays reachable when a parse fails, and a locale with no phrase sets
  is carried by choices alone. Shared rules supply facts and the speaker
  supplies the voice; shared lines in one shared voice turn NPCs into
  encyclopedias.
- **The conversation panel obeys §28.** Typing edits the field and nothing
  else, a line is sent once, on submit, and the reply is painted when it
  arrives — the panel never waits for it.

## 6. WS12 — the self-balancing economy

The goal is a currency that holds its value and prices that respond without
oscillating — and the honest way to get it is a controller with a stability
argument, not a heuristic.

- **The ledger is the truth.** Every currency faucet (quest reward, drop,
  vendor sale) and every sink (repair, tax, consumable, death penalty,
  crafting loss) is a recorded, typed transaction in the store. The realm's
  money supply is therefore a computed quantity, not a guess, and inflation is
  observable rather than inferred.
- **Vendor prices move on a damped proportional-integral controller, per item
  class.** Its input is the *median* recent trade price and the observed
  stock/demand imbalance — median, because a mean is trivially moved by one
  absurd trade. Its output is a price multiplier, clamped to a per-class band,
  rate-limited per interval, with the integral term clamped separately so it
  cannot wind up while the output is saturated at the band edge. Defaults ship
  tuned and enabled; a realm may retune the gains and the band, and may not
  remove the clamp.
  - **The stability claim is empirical, and stated as such.** The median input
    makes the loop non-linear, so a linear stability proof would not apply and
    is not offered. What is offered is a derivation of the default gains from
    the sampling interval and the rate limit, plus the §15 simulations that
    demonstrate convergence without ringing across the shock set. "Validated
    over the tested envelope" is the honest claim; "provably stable" would not
    be, and a plan that overclaims here would be worse than one that measures.
- **Arbitrage is closed by construction.** A vendor's buy price is always
  below its sell price by at least the class's spread, so buying and selling in
  a loop loses money at every scale. Per-player rate limits bound how fast one
  actor can move a class at all.
- **Sinks scale with wealth.** Repair and tax costs are a function of item
  value, so a wealthier realm drains faster — a proportional term that keeps
  the supply bounded without a wipe.
- **It is measured, not asserted.** Host tests simulate realms over long
  horizons under injected shocks (a duplication exploit, a mass sell-off, a
  population spike, a faucet left open) and assert bounded price drift,
  convergence within a stated interval, no oscillation, and no negative or
  overflowing balance. A property test drives random faucet/sink schedules and
  asserts the invariants hold for all of them. A blown bound is a defect fixed
  in the change, exactly like a failed test (§2.16).

## 7. WS1/WS8 — the realm and the wire

### Three processes

- **`wintersund`, the gateway.** Owns the listening socket and every client
  connection. Performs the handshake and authentication, enforces per-peer
  rate and bandwidth limits, relays chat, and routes each client's intents to
  the zone that owns its character. It holds `CAP_NET` and
  `CAP_NET_BIND_PRIVILEGED` only if its configured port needs it; the default
  port is unprivileged.
- **`wintersun-zone`, a shard.** Simulates one region of the realm. Holds no
  socket and no database handle: it speaks only to the gateway and the store.
  A zone crash therefore loses one region's live state, which the store's last
  committed tick restores, and cannot reach a player record or another zone.
  Zones hand characters over at their boundaries through an explicit transfer
  that is committed before it is acknowledged.
- **`wintersun-store`, the single writer.** The only process with the database
  open for writing (`plans/RECDB.md`). Serialises every commit, so the realm
  needs no distributed transaction, and is the only place a durability claim is
  made.

### The protocol

Fixed-width, versioned, little-endian frames with a bounded decode that is
total and fails closed — the `lib/abi` discipline applied to a game
(§24.4: the frame and field bounds are security bounds and stay fixed). One
fuzz harness per decoder (§19.6), and the corpus keeps every crash ever found.

Built (WS1) in `userland/games/wintersun/net`; `docs/src/userland/wintersun-net.md`
is the reference. Four settled points the rest of the game builds on:

- **The handshake is two plaintext messages plus a refusal**, and the realm
  always answers — `Hello` / `ServerHello`, or a `Refused` naming its reason,
  because a refusal before any key exists still has to say why. The encrypted
  session begins after them, and `Welcome` is its first realm message.
- **A record's nonce is its sequence in its direction and its length header is
  the associated data**, which is what refuses a reordered, replayed,
  truncated, extended or reflected record with no extra check. Any such
  failure *ends* the session and the end latches, so a peer cannot probe the
  transport one bad record at a time.
- **Every encoding is canonical.** A narrow variant is zero-padded and the
  padding is checked, an absent optional's id must be zero, and trailing bytes
  are refused — so a value has exactly one spelling and a decoded frame
  re-encodes to the bytes it came from. That equality is what the fuzz
  harnesses assert.
- **An entity on the wire is identity, kind, position, motion and facing.**
  Health, resources, equipment and status join it with the item that
  introduces them; a field with no consumer is surface nobody has reviewed.

- **Client → server:** `Hello`, `Authenticate`, `SelectCharacter`, `Intent`
  (movement, action, cast, interact, item), `Chat`, `ConsoleCommand`, `Ping`.
- **Server → client:** `Welcome` (the realm's world document `RealmSpec`, the
  protocol version, the content digest — the client validates the document
  through `RealmParams::new` before it acts on any other field, so a refused
  `Welcome` is refused whole), `AuthResult`, `Snapshot` and `Delta`
  (entities within interest, by tick), `WorldDelta` (stored changes to the
  generated base),
  `Event` (damage, cast, pickup, death — what the client needs to play a sound
  or an effect), `ChatMessage`, `ConsoleReply`, `Pong`, `Disconnect` with a
  stated reason (§2.24 — an abnormal end always says why).
- **Content *and the generator* are version-pinned.** `Welcome` carries the
  protocol version, a digest of the server's content documents, **and a digest
  of the world-generator and rules code versions**. The generator digest is not
  a formality: the client generates the terrain it walks on, so a client whose
  generator differs by one stage would draw ground the server does not simulate
  and desynchronise on collision — a defect that would present as "I fell
  through the floor" and be nearly impossible to diagnose from the symptom. A
  mismatch on any digest is refused at connect with the reason stated, never
  negotiated down.

### Playing at a hundred milliseconds

Server authority decides *correctness*; these four mechanisms decide whether
the game is playable over a real link. Each is a stated, tunable number, not an
emergent behaviour.

- **Interpolation delay.** Other entities are rendered at `server_time − one
  tick − jitter_margin`, where the margin adapts to measured arrival jitter
  within a bounded range. Too small and entities stutter on a late packet; too
  large and everyone is visibly in the past. Adapting it is what keeps both
  ends of that trade off the player's screen.
- **Prediction and reconciliation, for your own character only.** The client
  predicts its own movement immediately and replays unacknowledged intents over
  each authoritative state it receives. A correction below a stated threshold is
  **blended out over several frames**; above it, it snaps. Always snapping makes
  ordinary latency look like teleporting; never snapping lets a large
  divergence persist — so both paths exist with the threshold as the stated
  knob.
- **Lag compensation for aimed attacks, bounded.** For a projectile or an
  aimed shot the server rewinds candidate targets to the shooter's reported
  view time before testing — "favour the shooter", without which no ranged
  combat feels fair at distance. The rewind is **clamped to a maximum and
  validated against the shooter's own measured round trip**, so a client cannot
  claim an arbitrary rewind and shoot into the past. That clamp is the
  anti-cheat: the mechanism is generous within a bound the server computes and
  the client cannot influence.
- **Client-side effects, server-side truth.** A cast plays its animation, its
  sound and its particles at once; the damage is the server's. When the server
  refuses, the effect is retracted visibly rather than silently — a cast that
  played and did nothing reads as a bug, where one that visibly fizzles reads
  as a miss.

### Crowding: the case where everyone stands in one place

Interest management bounds bandwidth by distance, which fails exactly when a
hundred players gather in one market square — the load case every persistent
world meets on its first busy evening, and the one a distance-only scheme is
blind to.

- The per-client entity set is **hard-capped**, not merely distance-filtered.
  Above the cap, entities are chosen by priority — party and group members,
  combatants engaged with you, the nearest, then the rest — so a crowd degrades
  into "you see the ones that matter" instead of either flooding the link or
  silently dropping something you were fighting.
- Area-of-interest queries run over the zone's uniform grid, so a query costs
  the cells it overlaps rather than the zone's population; a crowd raises the
  cost of the cells it occupies and of nothing else. A naive all-pairs scan
  would be O(n²) in exactly this case and is refused.
- A zone whose population exceeds its budget **splits**, and the gateway routes
  to the split; it does not degrade the tick rate for everyone present. Tick
  rate is a correctness-adjacent property — the feel numbers above are all
  authored against it — so it is the last thing allowed to move.

### Finding a realm, and trusting the clock

- **Discovery.** A realm is reached by address, from a client-side list the
  player edits, plus optional link-local discovery for a realm on the same
  network. There is no central directory service: that would be infrastructure
  TAIRiX does not have and a privacy surface nobody asked for.
- **The server's clock is the only clock.** Every rate limit, cooldown, cast
  time and regeneration tick is measured against the *server's* monotonic
  clock, never a client-supplied timestamp. Client sample times and view times
  are inputs to be validated and clamped (above), never authority. This closes
  the whole speedhack family — a client that lies about how much time has
  passed is simply describing a window the server will not honour — and it is
  why the sub-tick sample time is safe to accept.

### Confidentiality and authentication

The session is wrapped in an authenticated encrypted channel built from
`lib/crypto`'s audited primitives — X25519 (P4) for agreement, ChaCha20-Poly1305
for the records, Ed25519 for the realm's identity, and HMAC-SHA256 over the
transcript as the key schedule — composed as a Noise-style handshake. The realm
signs the transcript rather than a fresh challenge, so its signature
authenticates *that* exchange and cannot be lifted onto another; the ephemeral
keys mean a later compromise of the identity key does not open a recorded
session. Signing stays outside the crate: `lib/crypto` exposes verification
only, so the responder takes a signer callback and the realm's secret never
enters the protocol code. Composing audited primitives is the
charter's crypto rule; inventing a primitive is not (§2.12). The realm's public
key is pinned by the client on first connect and a change is surfaced, so a
credential cannot be harvested by a substituted server.

A **local** player on the realm's own machine authenticates by the kernel's
attestation of the caller instead of a password: the gateway reads the peer's
unforgeable origin and needs no secret at all. A **remote** player has a realm
account whose authenticator is a PBKDF2 password record or a pinned public key,
following `lib/users`' record discipline (§5.1's constant-time verification,
one indistinguishable failure so accounts cannot be probed) without duplicating
its on-disk format.

### Interest management and the thousand-player floor

Each zone keeps a uniform spatial index of its entities. A client receives only
entities within its awareness radius, at a rate that falls off with distance —
near entities every tick, mid at a fraction, far as coarse position only. This
is what bounds the per-client byte rate independently of realm population, and
it is what makes a radar cheat structurally impossible rather than detected.

Everything is bounded and fails closed (§24.3, §26.2, §26.4): connections per
realm, connections per source address, bytes per second and frames per second
per peer, pending intents per peer, entities per zone, chat rate, and store
queue depth. Reaching a bound refuses the request with a reason and records it;
it never allocates without limit. Back-pressure propagates: a client that
cannot keep up is sent coarser deltas and then disconnected with a reason, and
never allowed to grow an unbounded queue in the gateway.

Nothing spins (§2.23). The gateway, the zones, and the store all park on a
`waitset` over their sockets, IPC endpoints, and one-shot timers, and are woken
by the event.

## 8. WS7 — persistence

The engine is `plans/RECDB.md` (P5); the realm's schemas are the game's:

- **Account** — identity, authenticator, created/last-seen `Time64`, role,
  moderation state.
- **Character** — owner, name, archetype, level and XP, stats, the figure
  parameters the designer produced, position and zone, resources.
- **Inventory and equipment** — stacks, affixes, durability, bound slot.
- **Progression** — skill allocations, discovered map regions, quest state.
- **World delta** — sparse, keyed by chunk: terrain and material edits,
  structures, depleted or respawning resource nodes, container contents.
- **Economy** — the transaction ledger and the per-class controller state.
- **Acquaintance** — per NPC and character: disposition, remembered facts,
  when they last met (WS21).
- **Tidings** — notable events with where and when, kept while any settlement
  can still hear them (WS21).
- **Realm** — seed, the secret seed, parameters, content digest, the last
  committed tick. The secret seed is drawn from the platform's randomness when
  the realm is created and keys everything the server generates that a client
  must not derive (decision 3); it is never sent, printed or logged.
- **Audit** — moderation actions and administrative commands, which also go to
  the system log's hash-chained trail (§19.4), because a realm administrator
  must not be able to erase their own record.

**The tick is the *consistency* unit; it is emphatically not the commit
cadence.** State is only ever captured at a tick boundary, so a transaction can
never hold a half-applied action. But committing every tick would mean a
durability barrier twenty or thirty times a second *per zone* — a hundred-plus
`fsync`-equivalents a second across a realm, which no disk survives and which
would make the store the whole realm's bottleneck. The two concerns are
separated:

- **Durability-critical events commit synchronously, before acknowledgement.**
  A logout, a completed trade, a level-up, an item created or destroyed, a
  currency movement, a zone handover. These are the things a player must never
  lose, and each is rare, so paying a barrier for each is affordable. "I logged
  out and lost my loot" stays structurally impossible.
- **Routine state commits on a bounded cadence**, whichever of these comes
  first: a dirty-record count, a dirty age, or a flush interval — all derived
  from the device's measured characteristics rather than hand-picked (§24.1).
  Position, resource regeneration and cooldowns are in this class. A crash
  therefore rewinds a character's *position* by up to the interval and nothing
  more, which is the standard and acceptable trade every persistent world
  makes.

This is the same distinction `plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` draws between a dirty
set and an explicit `fs_sync`, applied a layer up; the barrier is paid where
durability is actually claimed, not per tick.

## 9. WS14 — sound

`plans/SOUND.md` owns the stack (P1, P2). The game's design decision is how it consumes
it: **the game mixes its own voices into a single `audio-v1` stream.** `audiod`
mixes application streams to a device; a game mixing sixty-four footsteps,
spell tails, and thunder claps is one application composing its own stream,
exactly as it composes one window surface from many controls. It is not a
second system mixer, and it must not re-implement one: the conversion,
resampling, and channel-map arithmetic come from `lib/audio`, and only voice
management — emitter position to gain and pan, priority and voice stealing,
ducking, reverb zones, distance filtering — is the game's.

- Positional audio is 2D: gain from distance with a documented falloff, pan
  from bearing relative to the camera, low-pass with distance so a far sound is
  dull rather than merely quiet.
- **Thunder is delayed by the speed of sound from the strike, and rolls.**
  Lightning flashes, and the clap arrives a real interval later, low-passed by
  distance. It is one line of arithmetic and it is the single most convincing
  detail in a storm.
- Weather beds are continuous loops whose gain tracks precipitation intensity
  and whose character changes with wind; footstep and impact sounds are chosen
  by the material under the foot, which the splat field already knows.
- Music is a small adaptive set, cross-faded by region and combat state.
- Every compressed asset decodes in the §19.5 sandbox through `lib/sound`; the
  game holds decoded PCM, never a decoder in its own address space.
- A realm with no audio device, or a session that does not hold the seat's
  sink lease, plays no sound and continues (§2.24 — a refused optional action
  is reported, not fatal).

## 10. WS5/WS16/WS18 — the client's surfaces

### Windowed, maximised, and exclusive fullscreen

Three size states over P3's window channel. Windowed and maximised are
ordinary. Fullscreen asks the compositor for a scanout-sized surface, which the
layer path promotes to a single layer — no composition pass, a tear-free flip —
once the live session presents through it (P9); a resolution change goes
through the existing `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` `Configure` where the player chose one. Losing the seat (a fast user switch) is an event, not a crash: the
game pauses the simulation clock it owns, releases the sink lease, and resumes
at the exact position when the seat returns (`plans/DISPLAY.md`).

All UI lengths are authored in logical pixels and converted through
`tairix_geometry::Scale`, so the game is correct at any DPI and UI scale (`AGENTS.md` §10).
Every control is a `lib/controls` control with its specified states, theme
variants, and keyboard path (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`) — the game
hand-rolls no widget.

### The console

An overlay command surface: history, completion, and a command set whose help
comes from the bundle's own `Help/` tree through `lib/help`, never a hardcoded
string (§16.5). A client command affects only the client (graphics, audio,
diagnostics). A realm command is sent as `ConsoleCommand` and authorised
**server-side** against the account's role — a client-side role check is
decoration, and the server never trusts one.

### Chat

Channels: say (local radius), party, guild, whisper, and realm. Every message
is length-bounded, stripped of control characters, rate-limited per account,
and rendered as data — never interpreted, never a command path, never read by
an NPC (speaking to one is WS21's own message), never able to inject a control
sequence into a terminal or a console. Per-account mute and block lists are
honoured server-side so a blocked message is never sent, not merely hidden.

### Admin and moderation (WS16, WS15)

Roles are realm records. A moderator can mute, kick, and report; an
administrator can ban, adjust the economy's parameters within their clamps,
inspect entities, and shut the realm down cleanly. Every action is recorded in
the audit schema **and** the hash-chained system log (§19.4). `wintersunctl` is
a `kind = command` bundle in the system command store, so administration is
typeable, scriptable, and documented like any other command; it speaks the
gateway's control endpoint and follows the GNU-coreutils option and output
conventions the charter requires of a command app (§16.7), and it emits
`stdinfo` advisory records on fd 3 alongside its ordinary output (§20.1).

### The character designer (WS17)

The engine is `plans/FIGURE.md` FG6/FG7; the surfaces are the game's. A
category rail (species, build, face, hair, markings, palette, gear) over
`lib/controls` sliders and pickers, with a **live preview that plays an
animation** and a clip selector — a build judged in a static pose is a build
whose walk nobody checked — and a simultaneous small-size preview, so the
silhouette readability `plans/FIGURE.md` §4 measures is visible while authoring
rather than discovered by a failing test. Presets, a randomise-plausible
button, and the character library, stored through the store process.

What the surface composes, and what it adds: a `SliderAction::SetValue` is a
`Designer::edit` and a `Settled` is a `Designer::settle`, whose answer — the
record to write, or none — goes to the store through a `lib/util` `JobDesk`;
each frame drains its input, then catches the `Preview` up once with
`Preview::show` and draws `Frame::Shared` large and `Frame::Measured` at the
readability floor. A preset or a "surprise me" draw
(`plausible::figure`, over a `NonCryptoRng` seeded once from the platform) is a
`Designer::apply` and a settle. A refused write reopens the designer on the
record the store holds.

Two obligations bind it, and it is the surface most likely to breach both
(§28): a slider changes the parameter in memory and repaints — it opens no
store and writes nothing per motion sample — and the durable write happens once
when the drag settles; and a repaint rebuilds only what the changed parameter
invalidates, so a palette edit re-tints and does not re-rig. On submission the
**server re-validates every parameter** against its bounds, because the record
arrives from a client and an impossible figure must be refused rather than
drawn (`plans/FIGURE.md` FG6).

### Accessibility and localisation (WS18)

Not a late pass — the charter already binds most of it. Reduced motion honours
the desktop's setting and damps camera shake, flashes, and particle density.
Lightning flash intensity is capped and separately adjustable, because an
uncapped white flash is a photosensitivity hazard. Colourblind-safe variants of
every status and faction colour, with shape and pattern carrying the same
information (§15 of the controls spec). Full input remapping, keyboard-only
play, and pointer-only play. Subtitles and captions for audio cues, which a
player with no audio device needs anyway. UI scale independent of window size.
All strings and the help tree are per-locale with the deterministic fallback to
`en-US` that `lib/help` already defines. A string that carries a value is
formatted by one per-locale formatter — plural category, and the gender and
case a noun takes — which WS21's NPC speech uses too.

### The detail-level control (WS18)

**Built.** §3 states the mechanism; this is the choice over it and the window
it is made in. What a later item needs to know:

- **Four modes, one setting.** `graphics::Graphics` is `Auto`, `Ultra`,
  `Basic` or `Custom(Detail)`, because "let the machine decide", a preset and
  "exactly these knobs" are answers to one question. A new install is
  `Ultra`: every detail at its finest. `Basic` is every knob at its plainest at
  the window's own resolution — a preset chooses effects, not a blurrier
  picture — and `Custom` is the player's own setting of each knob.
- **A detail is four knobs** (`quality::Detail`): lighting (the light
  buffer's resolution), shadows (contact softness and the relief term,
  hardening together), the ground's octaves, and the render scale. The ladder
  is `auto`'s path through them and carries only the three that cost frame
  time; a knob no pass draws — particle density until WS13 — is on neither.
- **The store holds what is in force and nothing else**: `graphics.mode`
  always, and the four knobs only while the choice is custom, in the
  application's own per-app data. It is never sent to a realm and is no input
  to the simulation or the digest. It is read once before the window opens,
  and a store that cannot be read leaves every detail at its finest with the
  reason stated.
- **The window.** The icon-bar slot's menu reads *Info*, *Settings…*, a rule,
  *Quit* (`appbar`). *Settings…* opens a second window on the same channel
  and mailbox (`settings::SettingsWindow`): a category strip down its side,
  with graphics the category there is — key bindings and sound are a row in
  `Category::ALL` and a pane beside it — a quality chooser, and one detented
  slider per knob. Moving a slider makes the choice custom from the detail on
  screen, so a player can watch what `auto` settled on and pin it by touching
  it; on `auto` the sliders follow the governor. The window's size is fixed
  when it opens, measured for every row at the longest it can be put. A
  window cannot raise itself, so the row is declared disabled with its reason
  while the window is open.
- **§28, the charter's own worked example, is met.** A drag previews its
  detail on the next frame and writes nothing; the one write is where it
  settles, and a chosen mode is one write. The write goes through a
  `tairix_rt::work::Worker`; what the store then holds is adopted unless the
  player has moved on since (`graphics::Choice`), and a refused write is
  reported and puts the stored choice back. The window's picture is retained
  and only what its controls report is repainted and presented.
- **Choosing a render scale below the floor is allowed and says so** on its
  row: figures may not read clearly at that zoom.
- **The governor reads the machine over seconds.** It measures cost per render
  pixel, so a resize moves the predicted cost without discarding history;
  remembers each step's cheapest frame, which makes how busy the machine is a
  ratio it smooths over six seconds; sheds one notch on a frame that itself
  overran once smoothed frames have overrun for a second where the step's
  best would not fit either, or six where it would; gives one back on a
  prediction from the finer step's aged best, on trial; and counts nothing
  for half a second after a move or a resize, nor the time a frame spent
  synthesising tiles. Its dwells are counted in drawn frame time, so a pause
  is neither overrun nor comfort.
- **Tested**, host-side: the governor against simulated machines (a moment of
  other work sheds nothing; a busy machine that has drawn well holds for six
  seconds; detail too dear goes a notch at a time and stops where frames fit;
  a larger window stops short of the bottom and the notches come back when it
  shrinks; a pause counts as neither; a restore that overruns is taken back
  within its trial and not retried until its evidence has aged), the stored
  choice over the shared fake app-data service, a drag producing previews and
  exactly one write, detents, the chooser, every row fitting the window
  whatever it says, and a scoped repaint byte-identical to a whole one.
  The proptest model holds the ladder to one notch a frame.
- **Remaining in WS18:** the accessibility and localisation above, and the
  settings window's other categories as their items build what they set.

## 11. Resource limits and the operating-conditions floor

The game and the realm are held to §24 and §26 like any other subsystem.

- No capacity is a hand-picked constant (§24.1). Chunk cache, entity budgets,
  connection counts, and the store's page cache are all derived from the
  discovered machine and grow on demand, failing closed only on genuine
  exhaustion as a typed error (§4, §2.9).
- **The stated floor:** a realm serving a thousand players and a client
  rendering at a playable rate must both hold on a modest machine, and the
  conjunction is what is tested, not each in isolation (§26.7). The client's
  resident set is its working set — the chunks and materials on screen — not
  the world's extent. The realm's is its live entities and its page cache, not
  its player count on disk.
- Under memory pressure everything reclaimable shrinks through `lib/reclaim`'s
  bands before anything refuses: material mips and scenery sprites; chunk,
  district and feature caches; decoded artwork; audio beds; and the store's
  page cache, in that order (§26.3).
- A failing disk under the store is an expected outcome, surfaced as a typed
  error and an audited event, never a panic and never silently served data the
  store cannot vouch for (§26.5).

## 12. Diagnosing it, and iterating on it

Two things decide a team's velocity on a project this size, and neither is a
feature a player sees.

- **A desync must be bisectable, not guessable.** The simulation is
  deterministic, so every tick has a state hash. A client and server exchange
  hashes periodically; on a mismatch the client reports the **first diverging
  tick** and both sides dump the per-entity hashes for it, so the answer is
  "entity 412's velocity diverged at tick 90 113" rather than "players
  disagree". Without this, one non-deterministic line costs days to find; with
  it, minutes. The intent log plus the seed replays the whole session, which is
  also the moderation audit trail.
- **A frame's cost is attributable.** The per-pass budget (§3) is *measured* at
  runtime, not just in tests: the client records per-pass timings, the
  active degradation step, its mode, and whether it has reached the
  readability floor, readable from the console. A budget nobody can
  observe in the running game is one that silently rots.
- **Content reloads without a restart.** Spells, items, skill trees and loot
  tables are declarative documents, and the server
  re-reads and re-validates them on an admin command, rejecting an invalid set
  **without** dropping the live one. Tuning a spell's windup must cost seconds,
  not a rebuild and a relog — iteration time is the single largest multiplier
  on how good the combat ends up being. A reload is refused for anything that
  would invalidate live state (a removed item a player holds), with the reason
  named.

## 13. Risks, and what would be done about them

A plan this size without a risk register is a plan that has not been thought
about. Each entry names the trigger, the mitigation, and — where one exists —
the criterion for abandoning the approach rather than sinking more into it.

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation and kill criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **The software renderer misses the frame budget** at 1280×720 on the reference machine | High | The stated degradation order and render scaling absorb an overrun down to the readability floor (§3); below it the frame rate gives way and the diagnostic says so, rather than the picture quietly becoming unreadable. Measured at M1, which exists for this. If 720p60 is unreachable after the SIMD and tiling work, the baseline drops to 960×540 and is **stated** rather than quietly missed; the renderer is not rescued by cutting the visual design. From WS32's 3D view on, the budget is the GPU path's, and the software path is held to as fast as the CPU allows rather than to 720p60. |
| **Cross-target determinism breaks** | High | `lib/util::mathf` is FMA-free, and its only intrinsics are the square root and integer rounding IEEE 754 fixes to one answer, which is what makes the claim affordable. The four-target hash verticals are the gate WS34 restores; until then a change that brings `mul_add` or per-target SIMD into an authoritative path says so and re-scopes the vertical it breaks (decision 4). Escape hatch if agreement proves unholdable at WS34: fixed-point arithmetic for the authoritative sim — costly, so it is a fallback, not a plan. |
| **The audio stack (P1) slips** | Medium | WS14 sits late deliberately, so M1–M4 do not block on it. The game ships silent and says so; it does not grow a private audio path (§14). |
| **The `cinder` migration regresses a shipped feature** | Medium | `cinder`'s existing shape, paint, gait and roam tests plus its QEMU vertical are the acceptance gate. If its pixels cannot be preserved, that is surfaced (§15.7), not absorbed. |
| **The thousand-player target is unmet** | Medium | Interest management, the per-client cap and zone splitting are the levers, and each degrades gracefully: the realm serves fewer players per zone rather than failing. The number is a measured property (§15), so a shortfall is reported with the figure reached. |
| **NPC understanding misses its floor, or its content outgrows its authors across the shipped locales** | Medium | Held-out accuracy is an exact figure per act and locale, because training is deterministic, so a shortfall is measured rather than felt. Layering keeps authoring proportional to what differs, phrases drafted offline widen coverage once a person has reviewed them, and choices carry any locale without phrase sets. Kill criterion: if en-US cannot reach its floor, free text is withdrawn and choices ship alone — the rule base, the knowledge and the voices are unchanged, and nothing half-working is kept. |
| **Scope** — the whole body of work is multi-year | High | The milestone structure exists for this: every milestone exits with a playable or measured artefact, so the work is steerable and cancellable at each boundary rather than all-or-nothing. |
| **The economy is gamed in a way the shock set did not model** | Low | The ledger makes exploitation observable after the fact, the clamps bound the damage while it is happening, and the admin surface can retune within them. A new exploit becomes a new shock case in the test set. |

## 14. Refused by name

Stating these once stops each being re-proposed.

- **A scripting VM for content** (Lua or otherwise) — untrusted code execution,
  a JIT surface, and a C dependency. Content is data over a closed vocabulary
  (decision 5).
- **A language model generating NPC speech at runtime.** The player would
  write its prompt — decision 1's hostile client, arriving as text — and it
  invents places the world does not have, cannot be replayed (decision 4), says
  things nobody reviewed, and costs more than the thousand-player floor can
  pay. Drafting phrases or line variants with one offline, for a person to
  review and commit as data, is authoring and is not refused (WS21).
- **A private GPU path, or a second renderer.** The game reaches a GPU through
  `plans/GPU.md`'s seam like every other consumer, and the software renderer
  stays complete and mandatory without it. OpenGL specifically is refused there,
  on the grounds that no GPU is tied to it and its object model aged badly —
  not on the withdrawn argument that a C-specified API cannot be implemented in
  Rust.
- **A client-authoritative anything.** Including "trusted" clients, host
  migration, and client-side hit detection.
- **A second renderer, rasteriser, or blend path** for the game, and a private
  framebuffer or GPU back-channel that bypasses the compositor (§2.2, §17.3).
- **A second system audio mixer.** The game composes one stream (§9).
- **A game-specific kernel capability or syscall.** Realm roles are records; the
  game's authority is an ordinary app's (decision 7).
- **Anti-cheat by client inspection** — scanning a player's memory or
  processes. Authority is the answer; surveillance is not, and TAIRiX will not
  ship a process that reads another's memory for a game.
- **Tile-grid terrain**, and shipped photographic terrain textures. Materials
  are synthesised and splatted (§3).
- **A `/proc`-style stats file or a fabricated virtual filesystem** for realm
  telemetry. Stats come from the control endpoint and `stdinfo` (§16.6, §20.1).
- **Real-money transactions, loot boxes, or any wagering mechanic.** Out of
  scope by design, not merely unimplemented.

## 15. Verification

Every item lands with its tests; these are the claims the plan is judged on.

- **Determinism.** A fixed seed and a fixed intent log produce one state hash
  after N ticks, run to run on each target until the game is complete and
  identical on `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `riscv64` and `wasm32` from WS34
  (decision 4). Run as a QEMU vertical per target.
- **World.** Chunk generation is pure and halo-bounded: a chunk generated alone
  equals the same chunk generated as part of its neighbourhood. Rivers flow
  downhill everywhere. Roads connect the sites they claim to. No biome weight
  vector is unnormalised. Generation is reproducible after an interruption at
  any stage. Every object, district and feature has one owner and is seen once
  from either side of any seam. The classifier is total, and the default realm
  holds every biome its latitude span reaches. Every cave is reachable from its
  mouths.
- **Settlements.** Names and layouts are seed-pure and seam-free — a
  settlement straddling chunks is identical from either side — and the world
  digest folds both on all four targets. Every generated name can be spelled
  in every shipped locale's script. Buildings, and every other solid object,
  block movement exactly where they are drawn. A person watched and unwatched over any interval stands where
  their timetable says unless a departure moved them, and a settlement nobody
  can see costs no tick work. Harm a player aims at an inhabitant is refused
  with its reason.
- **Rules.** Hand-computed damage, healing, resistance, and status cases; XP
  and level boundaries; skill-tree documents validated and malformed ones
  refused; a proptest that no sequence of legal actions produces a negative or
  overflowing stat, resource, or balance.
- **Economy.** Long-horizon simulations under injected shocks assert bounded
  drift, convergence, no oscillation, and closed arbitrage (§6).
- **Conversation.** Training is deterministic, so held-out accuracy per act and
  locale is an exact figure, gated at a stated floor as FG5 gates readability.
  A scripted conversation replays line for line and effect for effect. Content
  with a tie between different effects, a cyclic grammar, a line over its
  bound, an act nothing answers, or no en-US is refused at load. A choice not
  offered, oversize text and a flood are refused. A corpus of
  instruction-shaped lines ("ignore your instructions and…") earns nothing
  beyond what its understood act's rules allow. A tiding never carries a
  position, a private deed or an unconsented name; disposition gained by
  repetition is bounded; every speaker answers `unclear`; a worker that faults
  mid-turn, or answers outside the act set, costs that conversation and
  nothing else. The turn cost and each locale's model size are measured
  against their budgets.
- **Protocol.** Round-trip and bounded-decode tests for every frame; fuzz
  harnesses for every decoder with the regression corpus; a test that an
  oversize, truncated, or reordered frame is refused and the connection ended
  with a stated reason.
- **Game feel.** Each action's event phases land at their authored frames; the
  input buffer and grace windows accept and reject exactly at their bounds; no
  cancel edge escapes the validated table; a landed hit fires its presentation
  chord exactly once; and hitstop never advances or stalls the authoritative
  tick. Run at a simulated 100 ms round trip, which is the M4 exit criterion —
  feel that exists only on loopback is not feel.
- **Netcode under latency.** Over injected latency, jitter and loss: a
  reconciliation below the threshold is blended and one above it snaps (both
  asserted at the boundary); the interpolation margin adapts within its range
  and does not oscillate; a lag-compensation rewind beyond the clamp, or
  inconsistent with the shooter's measured round trip, is **refused**; a
  refused cast is visibly retracted rather than silently dropped.
- **Crowding.** With many times the per-client cap of players in one grid cell:
  the per-client entity set respects the cap, priority selection keeps party
  members and active combatants in the set, per-client bandwidth stays bounded,
  the area-of-interest query cost scales with overlapped cells and not with
  zone population, and a zone over budget splits without the tick rate moving.
- **The clock cannot be lied to.** A client reporting inflated elapsed time,
  back-dated sample times, or replayed intents gains no cooldown, cast-time,
  movement or regeneration advantage — one test per channel.
- **Diagnosis works.** An injected non-determinism is caught by the periodic
  state-hash exchange and reported as the *first* diverging tick with
  per-entity hashes, and the intent log plus seed replays the session to that
  tick. A content reload with an invalid document is refused with the live set
  intact.
- **The frame budget is measured, per pass**, at the baseline resolution on the
  reference machine, and the degradation order is exercised: each step engages
  in the stated sequence under injected overload and frame rate is the last
  thing to move.
- **Security.** A client claiming an impossible move, an unaffordable cast, an
  item it does not hold, a role it lacks, or an entity outside its interest is
  refused and audited — one test per claim. Chat with control characters is
  sanitised. A substituted realm key is surfaced.
- **Multiplayer vertical.** Two guests over the QEMU network path (`cargo
  xtask netpeer` is the existing precedent): connect, authenticate, both see
  each other move, one casts and the other takes damage, one disconnects
  uncleanly and the realm survives with the store's last tick intact.
- **Client vertical.** The game launches, opens a window, renders a
  deterministic frame from a fixed seed, and the composited pixels are read
  back and compared with the same scene drawn on the host (WS23). The three
  size states transition, each at the extent the window manager gives it, and
  the session's witness names how each frame reached the display: composited
  in software on ramfb, and promoted to a single layer in fullscreen on
  virtio-gpu (WS24). A seat switch pauses and resumes exactly, once
  `plans/NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` G5 decides who tells an application its seat has
  gone.
- **§28 compliance.** No frame-loop store read, file read, or IPC round trip; a
  slider drag produces one write; a pointer-motion burst produces one frame; a
  repaint's damage is scoped to what changed. Asserted, not asserted-about.
- **Art quality** is gated by `plans/FIGURE.md`'s contact-sheet goldens and
  readability checks, because "the art is good" is otherwise unfalsifiable.
- **Floor.** A realm at its stated population with multiple zones on a modest
  discovered-RAM configuration: bounded resident set, growth then fail-closed
  on exhaustion, no panic, no busy-spin (§26.7).
- **Oracles.** `loom` models for the client↔server frame ring and the store's
  submission queue, since both are lock-free producer/consumer protocols whose
  correctness is an ordering claim; `miri` enrolment for any crate carrying
  `unsafe` — which, on present design, is none of the game's own, because the
  only `unsafe` in the render path is `lib/parallel`'s already-enrolled
  `for_each` (§19.11).

### WS34 — cross-target agreement, before the game is complete

Until this item, agreement across targets is not required (decision 4). An
earlier item may change what a seed generates or trade agreement for speed, so
long as each target stays deterministic run to run and the vertical it
re-scopes says so. A released realm and its clients may run on different CPUs,
so this item makes agreement a gate again.

- **The authoritative results agree to the bit.** The world and the rules
  each produce one digest on `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `riscv64` and `wasm32`,
  asserted by the four-target verticals: the host suite, QEMU, and `wasm32`
  under Node. Every per-target divergence an earlier item brought into an
  authoritative path is made exact or leaves that path.
- **The picture agrees within tolerance.** The software frame is held to one
  reference within the tolerance the GPU path is held to (WS32), so a kernel
  may keep a per-target speed-up that changes a pixel but not the picture.
- **A mixed-CPU realm connects.** The generator digest a client recomputes
  matches its realm's whatever CPU each runs on.
- **Tests.** The four-target verticals assert one constant each for the world
  and the rules, the frame vertical asserts its tolerance, and a client on
  each target connects to a realm on each other.

## 16. Open decisions

Each is a real question this plan does not pretend to have answered. Whoever
reaches one stops and asks (§15.7) rather than choosing silently.

1. **An unreliable channel for position deltas.** TCP is correct and complete
   for the session, the world deltas, and events, and the protocol is framed so
   an additional unreliable channel for near-entity positions would be an added
   channel rather than a redesign. Whether it is worth the second path at this
   scale is unmeasured, and the decision waits on a measurement (§2.16).
2. **Zone shards across machines.** The gateway/zone split is already a process
   boundary, so distributing zones over a network is a transport change rather
   than an architectural one. Not in scope; the question is whether the
   zone↔gateway protocol should be designed for it from the start.
3. **Whether `cinder` belongs in `userland/games/` too.** It is a virtual pet
   with needs, intents and roaming — game-shaped by any reading — but it is
   also the first holder of `CAP_DESKTOP_LAYER` and the desktop-layer seam's
   only proof, and `plans/CINDER.md` CD13 wants a *second* holder to show the
   seam is a seam. Moving a mostly-finished feature to make a taxonomy tidy is
   not obviously worth it, and this plan does not need it: after FG1 the two
   share `lib/raster`'s outline primitives and nothing else. Recorded because
   the question will be asked, not because an answer is pending.
4. **Quests and dungeon interiors are named but carried by no item.** §6 pays
   quest rewards and §8 stores quest state; decision 3 conceals a dungeon's
   interior and WS2 places its entrance. Without an item neither is built.
   WS31's caves are not dungeons: they are natural terrain from the public
   seed, and they give a dungeon item the level model to build on. Offering or advancing a quest is conversation's most common effect, so WS21
   has no quest verb until the item that builds quests adds one, as decision 5
   adds any effect.
