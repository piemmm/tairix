# NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md — the graphical login screen and session switching

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This is the normative specification for how a
TAIRiX machine reaches a *logged-in* state: the boot-time choice between a
text and a graphical login, the first-class **graphical login screen**
(the *greeter*), the **session authority** that owns authentication and
session lifetime, and macOS-style **fast user switching** between several
concurrently live desktop sessions on one seat.

Read first, in order: `AGENTS.md` (all of it, especially §2, §4, §5, §10,
§16, §17.3, §19, §23, §26, §27), `plans/DISPLAY.md` (the seat/display
ownership model this builds on), `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` (the
Reactive Alloy `lib/controls` vocabulary every surface here composes — **no
second control implementation**), `plans/APPS.md`
(the bundle model), `plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` (CU5 elevation, capability
sizing), `plans/USERS.md` (service accounts and id ranges),
`plans/NEW-SUPERVISOR.md` (the pre-boot REPL), `plans/ICONS.md` (asset
tiers), and `plans/FONT-SERVICE.md` (`fontd`). Every rule in all of them
applies here without exception.

**Note:** `abi-v1` is *not* frozen before the first release, so the
`lib/abi` additions below are in-place evolution (`AGENTS.md` §2.13, §9).
Every `lib/abi` change regenerates the C header
(`cargo xtask c-header --write`); the drift guard enforces it.

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT** and **MAY**
are implementation requirements.

- **Seat** — one display with its keyboard and pointer (`plans/DISPLAY.md`).
  `SEAT_PRIMARY` is the boot seat. Exactly one task holds a seat's lease.
- **Greeter** — the graphical login screen: the program that owns the seat
  whenever no user session is in the foreground.
- **Session authority** — `login` (`/System/Services/login.app`): the only
  component that reads the user database, verifies a credential, and starts
  a session under another account. It is the trust anchor.
- **Desktop session** — one running `desktop.app` process, owned by one
  authenticated account.
- **Foreground session** — the one desktop session (or the greeter) that
  currently holds the seat lease.
- **Background session** — a live desktop session that does not hold the
  lease. Its processes keep running; it presents nothing.

## G0. Why the greeter is a separate process

The greeter links the whole `lib/controls`/`lib/raster`/`lib/font` drawing
stack and animates a full-screen scene. The session authority holds
`CAP_USERS_READ` and `CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER` — the two most dangerous grants on
the machine.

Folding the drawing stack into the authority would put a large rendering
surface inside the one process that can mint any user's identity. That is a
security regression (§2.7, §19.5) and is forbidden here. The two are
therefore separate processes with a narrow, versioned channel between them:

- the **greeter** knows how to draw and how to collect a name and a secret;
  it holds no capability that can read the user database, read a file, or
  start a process of any kind;
- the **authority** knows how to verify and how to start a session; it draws
  nothing and never links a graphics crate.

The greeter decodes no untrusted image: its backdrop, the ribbon of light, is
drawn rather than loaded (G9), which is what lets it hold neither filesystem
authority nor the parser-sandbox spawn.

This also keeps §17.3 clean: `userland/session/*` gains no edge to
`userland/gui/*`. The greeter composes `lib/*` crates only, exactly as the
text view composes `lib/curses`.

## G1. The boot session decision

Three inputs decide whether a boot ends at a text login or a graphical one.
They are evaluated in this order, highest first:

1. **The operator's supervisor choice**, if one was made this boot
   (`continue text` / `continue gui`). One boot only; never persisted.
2. **The administrator's stored default**, `os.loginType` in the
   `lib/sysconfig` store (`graphical` or `text`).
3. **The compiled default**, `graphical`.

A machine that can run a graphical login gets one without being configured
for it: the default is `graphical`, and there is exactly one definition of
it — `SystemConfig::default().login_type`. A *reachable* store that teaches
nothing (no document, an unreadable one, non-UTF-8 bytes, a parse error)
resolves through that same definition rather than spelling a fallback of
its own, so the default cannot be flipped in one place and silently ignored
in another.

**An unreachable store is a different fact and MUST NOT be collapsed into
the absent one.** A round that runs before the root unlock mounts
`/System/Settings` can read nothing at all, and assuming the compiled
default there would silently boot graphical over an administrator who had
configured the text prompt — a defect that stayed invisible only while the
compiled default happened to equal what losing the race produced. An
unreachable store therefore withholds a *default*: this round runs the text
prompt, which is always available and contradicts no stored choice, the next
round re-reads once the volume is up, and the operator's one-boot choice
still wins on the very first round.

**The two are told apart by the refusal, never by probing for a
directory.** One read of the document answers both questions, classified
once in `ConfigStore::from_read`. A mount whose backing volume is not
registered fails closed with `NotImplemented` and never falls back to
another volume, so that refusal — and only that one — means "ask again
later"; every other refusal came from a live volume that simply teaches
nothing. Inferring absence from the store's *directory* is forbidden and
was the original defect here: `configure` creates that directory on its
first write, so a machine nobody has configured has none, and the probe
read every fresh installation as an offline volume — pinning the
`Reachable(None) ⇒ graphical` rule above out of reach and silently
delivering a text prompt on every machine that had never been configured,
however capable of a graphical login it was.

A graphical choice is *offered* only when a graphical login is actually
possible this round (G4's availability probe). When it is not, the boot
degrades to the text login — never an error, never a blank screen (§2.24,
§5.4). That degradation is what makes a graphical default safe on a headless
or driverless machine, so it is load-bearing and its tests are not to be
relaxed.

A test image that needs the text prompt on hardware that *could* draw asks
for it outright — the autoload QEMU disk plants an `os.loginType text`
document rendered by the configuration engine itself — rather than leaning
on whatever the default happens to be.

### G1.1 `continue [text|gui]`

`lib/supervisor`'s `continue` command (aliases `boot`) takes an optional
single operand:

| Spelling | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `continue` | resume the boot with no override; the stored default decides |
| `continue text` | resume the boot and force a text login this boot |
| `continue gui` | resume the boot and force a graphical login this boot |

`graphical` and `desktop` are accepted as spellings of `gui`; `console` as a
spelling of `text`. Any other operand, or more than one, is refused with the
usage line and the REPL stays open (fail closed — an ambiguous instruction
never resumes the boot). Matching is case-insensitive, as for every other
supervisor command.

The command's outcome is `SupervisorExit::ContinueBoot(BootSession)`, where
`BootSession` is the `lib/abi` enum `Unset` / `Text` / `Graphical`.

### G1.2 Carrying the choice into userland

The supervisor runs in-kernel, before any volume is mounted, so the choice
cannot be written to the configuration store (it is not persistent policy in
any case). The kernel records it once and serves it through a new ungated
syscall, the `boot_facts_get` shape (`AGENTS.md` §16.6 — boot-static, public,
never live state):

- `tairix_abi::BootSession` — `Unset = 0`, `Text = 1`, `Graphical = 2`. An
  unrecognised wire value fails closed to `Unset`.
- `boot_session_get()` — no arguments, returns the recorded `BootSession`
  discriminant in the return register. No capability: the operator's boot
  choice is public machine state, carries no authority, and reveals no
  secret. Not audited (a read of a boot-static public value is not a
  security decision).
- The record is installed **once**, by the root-unlock boot path, from the
  supervisor's exit. A kernel that never entered the supervisor reports
  `Unset`. A second install is refused, so a later userland process cannot
  rewrite the operator's boot choice.
- Wrappers: `tairix_rt::boot_session()`, `tairix_sys_boot_session_get`.

### G1.3 Precedence in `login`

`login` re-reads both inputs each round (as it already does for
`os.loginType`), so the rule is one function with no cached state:

```
effective = match boot_session_get() {
    Text       => Text,
    Graphical  => Graphical,
    Unset      => configured os.loginType,
}
```

and the result is degraded to `Text` when a graphical login is not available
this round.

## G2. `lib/greeter` — the authentication-surface engine

One `lib/*` crate owns *everything* about what a screen-authentication
surface is and does; an embedder owns only the syscalls, the window, and the
way it actually verifies. `no_std + alloc`, host-tested, no dependency on
`lib/abi`, IPC, a compositor, or a seat.

It is a `lib/*` crate rather than private to one program because there are
two charter-legal consumers: the desktop's screen lock (G6) and the greeter
service (G3). There MUST NOT be two implementations of "prove who you are,
at the screen".

### G2.1 As built

```rust
pub struct AuthSurface;      // new(account) | with_accounts(tiles); on_event, render,
                             //   notice, field_rect, column_rect,
                             //   selected_account, set_chrome, set_cooldown
pub struct AccountTile;      // new(display, login), with_live_session, monogram
pub struct Chrome;           // identity, clock
pub struct Outcome;          // redraw(), verified(), damage()
pub struct EventContext<'a>; // screen, scale, theme, verifier
pub trait  Verifier { fn verify(&mut self, account: &str, secret: &str) -> Verdict; }
pub enum   Verdict { Verified, Refused, Unreachable }
pub enum   Backdrop { Desktop, Scene { ground: Color } }
pub fn panel_rect(screen: Rect, scale: Scale) -> Rect;
pub const MAX_CHROME: usize = 64;
pub const UNNAMED_ACCOUNT: &str = "Locked";
```

`new(account)` is the screen lock's constructor — one account, straight to
the field, no chooser, and `Escape` does nothing. `with_accounts` is the
login screen's — it opens on the chooser.

- **The secret** is a `lib/controls` `SecretField`, so masking, the console's
  `[input active...]` marker (which leaks neither the characters nor their
  count), and the volatile wipe on discard are the one shared
  implementation. The marker's dots are stepped by the surface's own
  `motion_due`/`advance` schedule. The surface erases the field on
  every terminal transition — verified, refused, unreachable, and drop.
  The field holds at most `tairix_abi::account::MAX_PASSWORD_LEN` bytes, the
  one bound every prompt, wire and the verifier share: the buffer is reserved
  once and never grown, so no copy of a secret is left in a freed block, and
  an entry longer than the bound is refused whole rather than offered as its
  prefix.
- **The verdict seam** keeps authentication with the embedder. Three
  answers, never two: `Unreachable` (nothing listening, a transport fault, a
  reply that is not the protocol) is never mistaken for `Refused` and never
  for a pass. Only `Verified` concludes the surface.
- **The geometry** is one column centred on the screen, defined once in
  `layout.rs` and read by both the paint and the pointer hit test, so the two
  cannot drift apart; a test asserts every pixel a keystroke changes falls
  inside the hit-tested field, and another presses the centre of every tile
  the grid drew and gets exactly that account.

  | Band | Logical size | Where |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | chrome | full width × 18 | 16 from the top; identity from the left inset, clock to the right one, 16 in (`Caption`, muted ink) |
  | disc | 88 × 88 | body top, centred |
  | name | full width × 26 | 14 under the disc (`Heading`) |
  | block (`panel_rect`) | 420 × 96 | 18 under the name |
  | field (`field_rect`) | 320 × `control_height` | block top; a pill, edged `rim_active` or `danger` |
  | notice | block width × 20 | 10 under the field |
  | step-back | block width × 18 | 6 under the notice, only when a chooser exists |
  | chooser grid | tiles 132 × 154, gap 12 | as many columns as fit; wraps only when it must |

  Every one of those is a *logical* length converted through `Scale` exactly
  once, so the screen is correct at any density and a second conversion
  cannot creep in. Each body is centred on the screen and pushed down only as
  far as a short screen needs to keep 28 clear of the chrome row, so it can
  never ride up over the clock. Where the row is too narrow for both lines
  the clock keeps its room and the identity is cut to what is left.

  **The chrome's presence is a function of the screen and the density
  alone** (`chrome_band`), never of which body is up: a screen that shows a
  clock while choosing an account still shows it while typing, so the
  surface cannot appear to gain or lose its chrome mid-login. It stands down
  only when the screen cannot hold both it and a whole prompt, and a 640×480
  screen still gets a usable, painted one.

  The secret field is drawn as a **pill** by masking the shared `SecretField`
  to a stadium and laying it over an edge of the same shape — the control's
  own square rim and focus ring are *removed*, not covered, so there is no
  second field implementation and no double border. The submit mark is drawn
  at rest only, because the field owns its own text region and an always-on
  trailing mark would sit under the marker.
- **Modal and total.** No key, click, or state dismisses the surface
  without a `Verified` verdict — no guest path, no timeout, no error state
  that falls through. A zero-extent screen yields no frame at all rather
  than a "lock" that covers nothing.
- **No rate limit here.** The budget belongs to the authority that can see
  attempts from every surface at once; a second one in the client would be
  both duplicated and trivially bypassed.
- **The chooser.** Account tiles — a monogram disc, the display name, and a
  badge on any account that already has a live session (the switch-user
  affordance) — plus an `Other…` tile, always last and always present, that
  accepts a typed login name so an unlisted account stays reachable.
  `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` and the arrow keys move focus with wrap-around, `Return`
  activates, `Escape` returns to the chooser and wipes the typed secret; the
  surface is fully operable with no pointer, because a machine without one
  must still log in. Tiles are `lib/controls` `IconTile`s, so the login
  screen is not a second visual vocabulary: the chosen account **frosts
  whatever the surface painted behind it** — the shared region frost the
  compositor blurs a window's backdrop with, at the theme's
  `selection_backdrop_blur` — and the shared accent, at three tenths opacity,
  is laid over that with a **crisp**, rounded edge. The fill is that light
  because the frost is what marks the tile; the accent only tints it.
  The blur belongs behind the mark, never on it: softening the fill itself
  leaves a smear with no shape of its own. It is also **short**: a box blur of
  radius `r` averages `2r + 1` samples, so a radius any appreciable fraction
  of a 132 × 154 tile averages the ground behind it to a single colour. A
  selected tile draws no
  outline
  of any kind on top — neither the focus ring nor the pointer wash, both
  suppressed by the selection rather than by the mark's strength, so nothing
  flickers while the mark arrives. A long
  display name **wraps** rather than being cut — `System Administrator` reads
  as itself, not as `System Admini`. The mark **cross-fades** as focus moves —
  the tile being left decays while the tile arrived at grows, frost and colour
  together, so a backdrop never snaps into focus ahead of the accent leaving
  it. The tile's height is derived from the
  control's own `label_lines`, not guessed: 154 logical pixels is the first
  height that holds three whole label lines at the reference density *and* at
  a doubled one, so a face wider than the test face still has somewhere for a
  long single word to fall.
  An `AccountTile` carries only what is drawn — display name, login name,
  live flag — never credential material, a uid, a capability set, or a home
  path. A tile draws a **monogram**, not an avatar: the system has no
  per-user avatar store, and an identifier nothing can resolve would be
  speculative surface.
- **The screen's motion.** Four animations, every duration read from the
  theme's `MotionInteraction` table and every one of them driven by the shared
  `Timeline` — one definition of how a duration becomes frames, so no surface
  keeps its own clock arithmetic and no two animations can ease differently by
  accident. A *travelling* element takes the eased (smoothstep) progress; a
  pure strength fade takes the linear one, through the shared
  `tairix_theme::Fade` (a `Timeline` plus a `from`/`to` strength pair).
  - The chooser's selection **cross-fade** (`SelectionChange`), above.
  - The **stage transition** (`StageTransition`) between the chooser and the
    chosen account's prompt, in **both** directions: the picked account's
    monogram disc travels and scales from its tile to the prompt's disc, the
    other tiles fade out, and the prompt's name, field and notice fade in. It
    interpolates the *layout* — the disc's centre and radius, and a strength
    per element — and draws one pass into the surface it already owns; a
    cross-fade of two full renders would cost a second screen's worth of
    memory for a quarter of a second and buy nothing.
  - The **rejection shake** (`AttemptRejected`): a refused secret displaces the
    prompt horizontally on a decaying oscillation that ends at exactly zero,
    so the refusal is legible before the notice is read. It is *additional* to
    the notice and the cooldown, never a replacement for either.
  - The **veil** (`SessionFade`), which is one animation run in **both**
    directions rather than two: `AuthSurface::begin_entry_fade` opens it off
    full black as the screen arrives, and `begin_session_fade` closes it to
    opaque as the screen leaves. There is deliberately no second fade type.
    - *Arriving.* The service calls `begin_entry_fade` before its opening
      present, so the very first frame the display ever receives is full
      black and the chooser appears out of it. That is what makes the whole
      cycle symmetric (chooser in → login → chooser to black → desktop from
      black → log out → desktop to black → chooser in again), and at first
      boot it covers the kernel text console's pixels in one step instead of
      replacing them with a chooser. Only the *leaving* direction is modal:
      `session_fade_begun` is direction-aware, so neither input handling nor
      the pointer stops for an arriving screen and a user may pick an account
      and type while it is still appearing. The arriving veil is **dropped**
      the frame it uncovers, so no fully-transparent fill is blended
      thereafter.
    - *Leaving.* On a verified secret, before the process exits. The
      authority starts the session on that exit, so a screen that has already
      gone black is what lets the desktop reveal from black over it without a
      seam — and it is why the fade must complete first. A secret accepted
      mid-arrival leaves from the strength the veil had reached, so the
      screen never brightens before it darkens. The leaving veil is *held*
      after it finishes, because its owner keeps the screen black until it
      exits. It is total: a lost display or a failed present still exits `0`
      promptly, because a cosmetic fade may never strand a successful login.
      Input is ignored once it begins; the decision is already made.

  Each rides the screen's existing park deadline — one one-shot wake per frame
  while something runs, none once everything settles — so a settled surface
  asks its embedder for no timer at all. A reduced-motion theme reports every
  duration as zero, which the timeline reads as *settled*: each change lands
  at once, with no second code path and no frame asked for.
- **The scene backdrop.** `Backdrop::Scene { ground }` leaves the surface
  transparent behind the column for an embedder that composites it over a
  scene of its own — the greeter's ribbon of light (G9) — and the engine
  gains nothing that paints one. Legibility comes from the text instead:
  every line is drawn with `lib/font`'s one soft shadow (`TextShadow`, laid
  through `tairix_controls::paint_run`, so a cut line ends in the shared
  elision mark) in the scene's `ground`, the chrome, the
  account name, the notice and step-back lines, and each account tile's own
  label (`IconTile`'s opt-in `with_label_shadow`, since a resting tile paints
  no plate) alike. Over that ground the shadow composes to exactly what is
  already there; wherever the scene's light passes behind a line, it holds
  the line off it. Every line of the column is set in the full on-surface
  ink, never the muted one; only the chrome, which a scene is not kept away
  from and which matters least, takes the muted one. A line fading with its
  stage fades its shadow with it. The decision is made **once**, in `render`, from the `Backdrop` it
  was handed: a scene asks for a shadow, the flat desktop colour does not —
  over that ground the shadow *is* the ground, so the screen lock pays for one
  glyph pass rather than two. The veil is dithered where it is applied — per
  pixel as the frame is composed, through `Pixel::dimmed_biased` over a
  `DitherRow` tiled from the surface's own coordinates — since a flat field
  over a gradient is the shape that bands when every pixel rounds alike.
  `AuthSurface::column_rect` is the rectangle the column stands in, from the
  top of the taller body to the foot of the lower one, as wide as the wider
  one, with room for the lines' shadows. It depends on the screen, the density
  and the accounts offered alone — never on the stage, the chrome, or anything
  typed — so a scene kept clear of it never moves as the screen changes, and a
  test asserts every pixel any stage draws falls inside it. The chrome's row
  is no part of it: a scene may pass behind the row, which stands on its
  shadow.
- **A per-account attempt budget** displayed as a cooldown. Per account, so
  a wrong password for one cannot lock another out, and monotonic-clock
  driven with `Duration64` — never wall clock, which the user may be able to
  move. It presents the authority's budget; it does not invent one, and it
  reads no clock: `set_cooldown` takes the remaining time from the
  authority's own answer. A submit during a cooldown re-states the wait,
  erases the typed secret, and never reaches the verifier.
- **Chrome and damage.** `set_chrome` supplies the two corner lines — what
  the machine is, and the date and time — bounded display text, either of
  which may be empty rather than guessed. The greeter spells them
  `TAIRiX 0.0.0 (lovelace)` from the unprivileged System Information identity
  and `Wednesday 30 September 2026 14:05` in UTC through `lib/fsmeta`'s
  calendar; the network address is not shown, since reading it takes
  authority the greeter does not hold. Every `Outcome` reports the rectangle
  the next paint changes (the field for a keystroke, the panel for a verdict,
  the grid for a focus move, the chrome's row and its lines' shadows for a
  clock tick, nothing for one on a screen with no room for the row, the whole
  screen for a mode change), so the service presents a damage rect rather
  than a full-screen blit. Tests assert pixel-by-pixel that the reported
  rectangle is a superset of what actually changes. The surface produces a
  frame only in response to an event; left alone it presents nothing.

### G2.2 Failure is visible, never fatal

A scene its embedder cannot draw degrades to `Backdrop::Desktop`, the
theme's flat desktop colour. An unreachable font service degrades to the
compiled-in console atlas (`lib/font`). An empty account list still shows `Other…`. A cursor
that will not rasterise leaves a working screen with no pointer drawn. None
of these ends the greeter or blocks a login (§2.24).

But a degradation is only honest when the good path is actually reachable.
The freestanding `Run` build MUST enable every crate feature its render and
IPC paths need at run time — `tairix-font`'s `rt` above all, without which
there is no glyph transport installed at all and *every* string silently
draws nothing. A program that links a client crate with its transport
feature off has not degraded gracefully; it has failed silently, which is
the opposite. The greeter's `Cargo.toml` carries a per-crate justification
for each feature it enables, and its README tabulates them, so the next
reader can tell a deliberate omission from a forgotten one.

## G3. `greeter.app` — the service

`userland/session/greeter`, planted at `/System/Services/greeter.app`,
`kind = "service"`. It runs as its own **`greeter` service account** (a
dedicated uid from the service range, `plans/USERS.md`) — never as the
system user, and never as the account being logged in.

Manifest request (the smallest set that draws and reads one seat):

| Capability | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `CAP_DISPLAY` | acquire the seat lease while the login screen is up, and switch the display off while it sleeps (G9) |
| `CAP_INPUT_READ` | drain the owned seat's keyboard and pointer |
| `CAP_SHM` | the zero-copy frame region the display service maps |
| `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` | fail-loud termination reasons on stderr (§2.24) |
| `CAP_LOG_EMIT` | its own audit records |

It requests **no** `CAP_USERS_READ`, **no** `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, **no**
`CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER`, `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` or `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`, and **no**
`CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`. It cannot read a credential store or any file,
cannot start a process of any kind — the session it authenticates for
included — and cannot bind a reserved rendezvous. Compromising it yields a
screen, not an account.

The same five are the `greeter` account's ceiling (`GREETER_CEILING`), so
the manifest ∩ ceiling intersection loses nothing and neither list can drift
from the other unnoticed — both are pinned by tests, together with the six
capabilities that must stay off it.

Lifecycle:

1. Started by the authority when a graphical login is wanted.
2. Acquires `SEAT_PRIMARY`, configures the display service, drains input.
3. Calls the authority's `session-v1` endpoint for the account list.
4. On submit, calls `Authenticate`; the reply is `Accepted` or `Refused`.
5. On `Accepted` it releases the seat and **exits**. The kernel reclaims
   the lease on exit in any case (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D8), so the seat can
   never be left stranded by a greeter that dies at the wrong moment.
6. The authority then brings the target session to the foreground and,
   when that session ends, starts a fresh greeter.

Exiting rather than lingering is deliberate: the seat hand-off then has one
mechanism (the kernel's own reclaim-on-exit), no lease transfer is needed,
and a greeter cannot hold the screen behind a running desktop.

**The pointer is drawn by the service, not the engine.** A seat with a mouse
must show one — an invisible-but-working pointer is a defect, not a
minimalism — so the greeter rasterises the built-in arrow once at start-up
for the active `Scale`. The placement (origin = pointer − hotspot, and
sampling the artwork under a screen row) is `lib/cursor`'s `PlacedCursor`,
shared with the compositor: there is one definition of where a cursor sits,
and it lives in `lib/*` precisely because `userland/session/*` may not reach
into the window manager for it. Motion presents the **union of the cursor's
old and new rectangles** clipped to the screen — never the whole screen for
a mouse move, and never a stale pointer left behind — and motion that moves
nothing presents nothing, so a pointer at rest arms no timer.

**Moving the mouse costs no render and no round trip.** Pointer motion
streams: a hand movement is tens of reports a second, and the screen has to
stay ahead of it.

- The service keeps the **clean** rendered surface — the one
  `AuthSurface::render` produced, with no cursor in it — and re-renders only
  when the surface's own state changed. The set of things a render reads is
  closed (the surface's state, the screen, the scale, the backdrop) and each
  of them changes only through a call that returns an `Outcome` or raises the
  ribbon, which is why the cache provably cannot go stale. A `Repaint` is
  therefore three cases, not two: nothing, cursor-only, or painted — and a
  cursor-only round keeps the surface.
- The cursor is composited **at scan-out**, sampled over the cached surface
  while the damaged rows are copied, so it is always on top and never dirties
  the thing being reused.
- A drain applies every queued report and presents **once**, merging the
  damage (`Nothing` is the identity, whole-screen dominates, two regions
  become the region containing both, re-classified through the shared
  `sub_screen_damage` so a union that has grown to cover the screen is
  presented as the whole screen rather than an over-large region).

A bare move is then a hit test, two rectangle unions and a copy of the
cursor-sized union — no allocation, no glyph, no paint of the ribbon, and
one display call per burst instead of one per report.

## G4. The session authority

Lives in `userland/session/login`.

`login` keeps its present role and gains the graphical path. It binds one
new reserved endpoint and serves it for the machine's lifetime.

### G4.1 `session-v1` (`lib/abi/src/session_ipc.rs`)

Reserved `SESSION_ENDPOINT`, bound by the authority (which holds
`CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`). Three requests:

| Request | Sent by | Reply | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Accounts { offset }` | the greeter | `AccountPage` | display name, login name, `live` flag — never a hash, uid, ceiling, or home path |
| `Authenticate { username, password }` | the greeter | `SessionVerdict` | the whole point; the secret never leaves this call |
| `Background` | the foreground desktop session | `SessionVerdict` | step aside so the login screen comes back up (G5.1) |

**One question, one answer.** "Which accounts exist" and "which have a live
session" are the same question about the same records, so they are one
request with a `live` flag per record — two requests returning the same fact
would be duplication and could disagree.

**The list is paged**, not sent whole: a machine may have far more accounts
than one reply could hold, and a fixed ceiling a larger machine outgrows is
a defect. A page carries the whole list's `total`, so a client walks pages
until it has them all.

**A tile draws a monogram, not an avatar.** There is no per-user avatar
store on the system, so an avatar id would name nothing. The disc itself is
the shared `tairix_icon::monogram_disc`, so the desktop's own account capsule
on the icon bar (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T9) draws the same picture for the
same account, and a per-user avatar — when there is one to name — lands in
that one generator rather than two.

**One string behind every mark.** A tile's mark comes from the account's
*shown* name — `UserRecord::shown_name`, the record's human-readable name or
its login name when it carries none — which is the one definition the account
list here, the screen lock's prompt, and the desktop's capsule all read. Login
carries it to a session beside `USER` as `tairix_abi::ENV_SHOWN_NAME`, because
a desktop cannot re-derive it (it holds no account database, and must not) and
deriving a mark from the login name instead marked `root` as `R` on the
desktop where this screen had shown "System Administrator". The name a person
is *shown* and the name offered to an authority are separate throughout —
`AuthSurface::new(login, shown)` — so a display placeholder can never be
offered as a credential.

The two greeter requests are refused unless the caller's **kernel-attested**
uid is the `greeter` service account and its attested console matches the
authority's own — the `handle_elevate_request` placement check. `Background`
carries its own, different rule (G5.1). Every refusal is one answer: unknown
account, wrong password, locked account, no database, and an unattested
caller are byte-identical, so a reply can never be used to probe for
accounts; the reason lives in the audit trail. A refusal carries only
`retry_after`, the remaining per-account cooldown, because a screen that
could not say "wait 30 seconds" would leave the user pressing a key that
silently does nothing. The verify path is timing-equalised in `lib/users`,
exactly as the text prompt and the elevation broker already are, and every
decision is audited with a stable event id.

An unauthorised or undecodable request is answered with a well-formed
**empty page**, never an errno — so a client bug reaches the greeter as a
protocol fault (which it is) rather than being shown to the user as a wrong
password.

The request buffer holds a secret, so it is wiped on every path out of the
handler, and the secret is never logged, never placed in an `stdinfo`
record, and never carried in a reply.

`Authenticate` does **not** itself start anything: it returns a verdict. The
authority starts the session on its own loop, so the greeter can never
choose *which* program runs as the authenticated user.

That ordering is also what makes the hand-over seamless, and it is seamless
in **both** directions. The greeter fades its screen to black and only then
exits; the authority starts the desktop on that exit; the desktop **reveals
from black** over the same `SessionFade` duration, applied by the compositor
at the one point composed pixels become the scan-out frame. Going the other
way, the desktop **dissolves back into that black** before it releases the
seat — on log out, and on the fast-user-switch step-aside — and the greeter
the authority brings back appears out of it. The two halves never negotiate:
each simply animates its own second of the same continuous transition, which
is why neither needs to know about the other. The reveal is why the
compositor's hardware-layer path declines while it runs: a layer the display
scans out directly never passes through the dimming, so an accelerated frame
would appear at full brightness and lose the fade.

The desktop side is `ScreenFade` (`userland/gui/session/src/fade.rs`), one
`tairix_theme::Fade` over the compositor's screen reveal, turned around by
`arrive`/`depart` from whatever strength is on screen. Its arrival rides the
serve loop's existing park like any other animation. Its **departure cannot**:
it has to finish before the seat is given up, and parking on the session
wait-set would spin a core, because the sources the loop is no longer serving
report ready on every re-park. `run.rs`'s `fade_to_black` drives it instead —
present, sleep to the next frame on `tairix_rt::park_ns`, step — bounded by
the fade's own span, and a refused present simply stops the dim (the seat is
handed on cleared regardless). `SeatPresentation` fixes where the two sit in
a switch: `fade_out` runs only after the authority *accepted* the step-aside
and before `suspend`, while the seat and frame ring are still up; `fade_in`
runs after `reconfigure` and before `repaint_all`, so a **resumed** session
appears out of black exactly as a fresh one does rather than snapping back on
a cleared screen.

**The gap between them is the kernel's, and it is black.** Neither half owns
the seat while the greeter is exiting and the desktop is loading, so the
screen in that window belongs to the seat registry. The greeter's clean exit
releases with `ReleaseSurface::Handover`, which clears the scan-out and holds
it cleared rather than repainting the text console's retained screen over it
(`docs/src/desktop/seat.md`). That is what the fade fades *to*: without it a
minutes-old boot/text screen flashes between the two animations, and the
outgoing session's own pixels would linger for the next account. The desktop's
own clean exit and its fast-user-switch step-aside say the same thing, because
the login screen is what comes back. Every failure path releases with
`ReleaseSurface::Text` instead, so the reason lands somewhere a person can read
it — and the blank is self-healing regardless: the console takes the screen
back the moment a *program* writes to it.

A kernel diagnostic is the one thing that does not reclaim it, and that is
load-bearing here. On a shippable image the kernel's diagnostic sink renders
onto the same framebuffer, and the authority audits `SESSION_ENDED` in
exactly this gap; taking the screen for that one routine record replayed the
whole retained boot log between the desktop and the returning chooser. A
diagnostic now advances the retained grid and its log without painting a
cleared surface, while program output — a text login, a shell, a stated
failure — still takes it back whole (`lib/fbcon`, `docs/src/desktop/seat.md`).

The desktop announces itself visible once the reveal settles — one diagnostic
record, emitted after a present that reached the display, and the witness a
test keys on to photograph a screen that is actually showing something. The
first presented frame can no longer serve as that witness: it is deliberately
black, and black is indistinguishable from a blank screen. Emitting it needed
`CAP_LOG_EMIT` in `SESSION_BASELINE`, since no interactive ceiling carried it
and the kernel discarded every record a session wrote — which had also been
losing the session's own cache ledgers, silently, since long before this. The
widening is real and deliberate: any program a logged-in user runs may now
write to the machine-wide **diagnostic** log. The audit log is a separate
capability, stays kernel-only, and is attributed by the kernel rather than the
caller, so none of this reaches it.

### G4.2 The round

The authority's per-console loop becomes:

```
loop {
    reload the user database                     (existing)
    kind = effective login type                  (G1.3)
    if kind == Graphical && graphical available:
        run one graphical round
    else:
        run one text round                       (existing)
}
```

A graphical round: start the greeter → serve `session-v1` until it reports
`Accepted` and exits → bring the target session to the foreground → wait →
loop. A greeter that dies without accepting is restarted; three consecutive
failures degrade the round to the text login with the reason on stderr and
in the log (§2.24), so a broken greeter can never leave the machine
unusable.

### G4.3 Availability

A graphical login is available this round when the greeter bundle is
installed **and** the desktop bundle is installed **and** a display service
answers `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` — the existing probe, extended by one path. All
three are re-checked per round and every failure degrades to text.

## G5. Fast user switching

Lives in `userland/session/login` and `userland/gui/session`.

The authority keeps the **session table**: one entry per account with a live
desktop session, holding the account's uid, the session process id, and its
state (`Foreground` / `Background`). At most one entry is `Foreground`, and
the invariant is asserted after every mutation. The wake mailbox is
*derived* from the process id (`session_wake_endpoint`), never stored, so
the two cannot disagree.

### G5.1 Switching away

`Switch User…` in the desktop's session menu sends `SessionRequest::Background`:

1. The authority honours it **only** from the session it records as the
   foreground one, identified by the caller's kernel-attested uid on its own
   console. The greeter's uid, a background session, and any other local
   process are all refused — nothing else can take the screen away from the
   person using it.
2. Only on `Accepted` does the session tear down presentation and release
   the seat. Releasing first would black the screen with nobody drawing.
3. It keeps running: its apps keep running, its window server keeps
   answering, it simply presents nothing and parks on its wake mailbox with
   no timeout.
4. The authority's round returns to the login screen, leaving the entry in
   the table. Before each round it reaps any background session that has
   exited and forgets its entry, so one that dies while switched away
   neither lingers as a zombie nor reads as live.

**Logging out** is different and unchanged in meaning: the session exits,
its entry leaves the table, and the greeter comes up. The round tells the
two apart explicitly — a child that exited is removed and audited as ended;
a session that backgrounded itself is kept and stays resumable. A leaving
desktop asks every window to close and keeps serving for at most
`SESSION_CLOSE_GRACE` before it exits; the kernel ends whatever its
applications left running (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`).

**If the authority itself exits** (a dead console; PID 1 relaunches it) it
first drains the table newest-first and sends each entry `SessionWake::End`,
then waits on their exits for at most `SESSION_END_GRACE`. Every session it
started is nested in the one anchored at it, so the kernel ends what is still
running when it exits, and nothing is left unreachable behind a relaunched
authority.

### G5.2 Switching back

When the greeter reports `Accepted` for an account that already has a live
session, the authority does **not** start a second one. It:

1. waits for the greeter to exit (which frees the seat);
2. wakes the background session through its **wake mailbox** —
   `session_wake_endpoint(pid)`: the session's own never-reused task id under
   a fixed high tag, so every session binds a distinct, collision-free,
   unreserved id and no new kernel namespace is invented. The session holds
   it as a member of its existing wait-set, so it is woken by an event and
   never polls;
3. the session re-acquires `SEAT_PRIMARY`, re-configures the display
   service (the mode may have changed), repaints in full, and resumes.

A wake that cannot be delivered means the session may already be gone, so
the authority reaps it non-blockingly to find out: a reaped session leaves
the table and a fresh desktop starts, while one still running keeps its
entry and the round returns to the login screen rather than starting a
second desktop for one account.

The wake message carries no authority: it says "you are foreground", and the
kernel's own seat exclusivity is what actually decides who may present. A
session that finds the seat busy fails closed and reports rather than
spinning.

### G5.3 Guarantees

- A background session's memory is **not** exposed to the foreground user:
  isolation is the kernel's page tables, unchanged (§4).
- A background session's screen contents are never composited while another
  user holds the seat, and the seat's undrained keystrokes are purged on
  every lease change (the kernel already does this, `plans/DISPLAY.md` D8),
  so a switch cannot leak a partially typed secret into the next owner.
- The account that owns a background session must re-authenticate to return
  to it. There is no path from the greeter to a live session without a
  successful `Authenticate` for that account.
- The authority never leaves a session it can no longer reach: if it exits,
  it tells every entry to end, and the kernel ends what does not.

## G6. One surface, two uses

The desktop's `ScreenLock` (`userland/gui/session/src/lock.rs`) is the same
surface as the greeter with the account fixed to the session's own and the
chooser and session actions suppressed. It composes `lib/greeter` and keeps
only its embedder duties: the compositor window, `keep_topmost`,
`LockedDrain`, the window-space mapping, and a `Verifier` over the
per-console elevation broker — which verifies against the caller's
kernel-attested uid, never a supplied name. No panel, field, layout, or
wording remains duplicated in the session crate.

The greeter service is the second embedder of the same engine — a different
`Verifier` (the `session-v1` client) and a different `Backdrop`, not a
second surface.

## G7. Documentation and verticals

The docs: `docs/src/userland/login.md` (the session authority, the
`session-v1` surface and its gates, the attempt budget, the session table),
`docs/src/userland/greeter.md` (the service), `docs/src/lib/greeter.md` (the
surface engine), and the `README.md` feature and attack-vector matrices.

### G7.1 QEMU verticals

**"Host-green" is not "works".** A host test renders into a `Surface` with
a test transport already installed; it cannot see a freestanding binary
built without its glyph transport, a capability gate that refuses only at
run time, a cursor hit-tested but never drawn, or a policy fed a refusal it
misreads — each of which a real boot to this screen has shown with every
crate green. Only a vertical that boots the real graph can.

The verticals owed are

1. a graphical boot reaching the greeter and presenting a first frame,
   `tests/integration/greeter_default_qemu_aarch64`;
2. an authentication landing on the desktop;
3. a logout returning to the greeter;
4. a switch between two accounts and back.

**1.** `tairix-test-greeter-default-qemu-aarch64` boots the aarch64
`virt` board with a display and the signed input/display driver bundles on
`FsDisk::GreeterRootDisk` — the autoload driver store with the **standard**
application store, so no `os.loginType` is planted and the machine is in the
state a fresh installation boots in. The host script types the unlock
passphrase and nothing else: no account, no `desktop` command. It passes only
on two **kernel-attested** witnesses — an `APP_LOADED` naming the greeter's
bundle in the system service store, then a reply the display service serves
on `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` after it — because a userland record reaches the
diagnostic sink alone and could be forged or truncated by user space. So the
login screen is provably login's own choice, reached after the encrypted root
mounted and its settings store answered "no configuration" rather than "not
here". The sibling autoload verticals plant `os.loginType text` precisely
because their scripts drive a shell.

**2–4.** These need what 1 deliberately does not: a scripted
authentication at the login screen (a pointer script selecting a tile and
typed credentials reaching the greeter's own field, not the console
type-ahead the unlock prompt drains), and then screendump assertions over
the desktop that follows. Vertical 2 MUST assert on *content*, not merely
that a frame arrived: readable text present, the ribbon drawn rather than a
flat colour, and a pointer visible — the three things a green host suite has
let through. The harness for all of it now exists (`ramfb`, virtio
keyboard/mouse, `ScreendumpPlan`, `pointer_script`), so what remains is the
verticals themselves, not infrastructure.

## G8. The terminal a text session leaves behind

A text console is shared, so the end of a session is a boundary: nothing
the session left on the terminal is the next user's to see. `login` takes
the terminal back at every session boundary — a clean exit, a load refusal,
a session that never started — through the `LoginView::session_ended` seam
(the counterpart of `session_handoff`), which the production view drives
with `tairix_rt::purge_terminal`. A merely rejected credential is not a
boundary: nothing ran, so nothing is discarded.

The discarding is the kernel's, not an escape sequence the login hopes a
terminal honours (`terminal_purge`, syscall 108,
`docs/src/architecture/syscalls.md`):

- `ConsoleWrite::purge` — a retained framebuffer console (`lib/fbcon`
  `TextConsole::purge`) blanks **both** cell grids, so the alternate screen
  a full-screen program left behind cannot be revealed by whoever comes
  next; rewrites every pixel including the margins and stride slack; and
  resets the parser so a held escape prefix cannot be completed by the next
  session's first bytes. A byte-stream console owns no display, so the
  default asks the remote emulator instead, with the one shared
  `tairix_vt::control::SESSION_RESET` sequence (leave alt screen, erase
  display, erase saved scrollback, home, plain pen).
- `ConsoleRead::purge` — the type-ahead ring is re-initialised (every slot
  zeroed, not merely unqueued), so keystrokes typed ahead of the reader,
  including a mistyped credential, are neither delivered nor left in kernel
  memory. A device with no queue of its own is drained under a fixed read
  bound; the blocking adapter delegates to its backing rather than parking
  on the keystrokes the purge exists to refuse.
- `ConsoleDevice::purge_session` / `Pty::purge_session` — input first,
  then the discipline back to cooked (which also clears the secret-entry
  marker), then the display, so nothing repaints over the blank screen.

Both halves' authority is required (`CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` at the dispatcher,
`CAP_CONSOLE_READ` in the handler before any state is touched) and only the
terminal's controlling owner is admitted. The controlling ownership itself
is deliberately untouched: releasing it here would let a task that never
held the terminal take its control.

## G9. The ribbon behind the column, and the screen's sleep

### G9.1 The ribbon of light

The login screen stands over the minimal-clock screensaver's ribbon of
light, not a wallpaper. The scene is `lib/ribbon` — the one definition the
screensaver (`userland/gui/session/src/saver/ribbon.rs`) and the greeter
share, since neither may depend on the other — and the greeter adds only
where its pixels go:

- **Its own layer.** `scene::Scene` holds the ribbon's pixels at the screen's
  size, repainted only in the strips a frame moved. The painted surface is
  `Backdrop::Scene { ground: SKY }` — transparent behind the column — and
  `frame::Scanout` lays it over the ribbon one scanline at a time through
  `lib/raster`'s one span composite, then applies the veil and samples the
  pointer. So a frame of the ribbon re-composes the pixels it moved and
  never paints the column, and a keystroke never paints the ribbon.
- **Kept clear of the column.** The ribbon's clear space is
  `AuthSurface::column_rect` (G2.1), stable across every stage, so the
  ribbon runs beneath the login column as it runs beneath the screensaver's
  time, and no stage change or clock tick ever moves it. What is kept clear
  is the light that shows, not the whole tail its glow is drawn to: the
  ribbon rises until that light meets the column, and `lib/ribbon` paints
  the column's clear space `SKY`, so the glow is drawn unchanged and nothing
  shows behind the text. The lines' shadow in `SKY` keeps a long account name
  legible where it reaches past the column, and the chrome, which the ribbon
  is not kept away from.
- **A night sky, so the dark theme.** The greeter takes the built-in theme
  of `Appearance::Dark` whatever the default appearance, because dark ink on
  the ribbon's black would be unreadable.
- **Paced by the ribbon's own clock.** `tairix_ribbon::Motion` draws a frame
  every `FRAME_NS` (every other display frame) and bounds how far a late one
  moves it; the frame is one more deadline in the park. Under reduced motion
  the ribbon holds still: painted once, no frame asked for.
- **Cost.** A frame repaints under half the screen's rows and re-composes
  only those strips. The chrome is rebuilt only when the wall-clock minute
  turns (`chrome::Teller`), not on every frame the ribbon wakes the loop for.
  The spend is bounded by the sleep below and is nothing under reduced
  motion.
- **Degradation.** A ribbon the heap will not give leaves the flat desktop
  colour (`Backdrop::Desktop`), audited `RIBBON_UNAVAILABLE`.

With nothing loaded from disk and nothing decoded, the greeter's
`CAP_FS_ACCESS` and `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` are gone (G0, G3).

### G9.2 Energy saving

A login screen left untouched for `ENERGY_SAVING_AFTER_NS` — thirty minutes
of no seat input of any kind — puts its display to sleep. It is the
greeter's own fixed policy: the desktop's screensaver and display-off waits
are one user's settings, and nobody is logged in.

1. **The screen goes to rest.** A fresh `AuthSurface` replaces the one up —
   the chooser as it first came up, whatever was typed erased by the old
   surface as it drops, no lockout shown — so a half-typed secret does not
   outlive the person who walked away from it.
2. **It goes black, then the display off.** The whole frame is presented
   black, then the display is asked to switch off through
   `lib/display`'s `DisplaySleep`, the state machine the desktop's
   screensaver sleeps its display through too. A display with no power
   control, or one that refuses, is left showing that black
   (`DISPLAY_KEPT_BLACK`, once a process for no power control, each time for
   a refusal); one that switches off is audited `DISPLAY_ASLEEP`, and wakes
   on black rather than on the screen it went dark over.
3. **Asleep, it costs nothing.** No frame is presented, the ribbon does not
   move, the chrome is not kept, and the park has no timeout at all.
4. **Input wakes it and reaches nothing else.** Every record the drain reads
   while asleep is swallowed — pointer motion still carries the pointer, so it
   comes back where the hand put it — and the display is switched back on and
   the screen arrives out of black through the entry veil, exactly as it
   first did. A display that will not switch back on stays asleep
   (`DISPLAY_WAKE_REFUSED`) and the next input asks again. A display service
   whose presenter leaves while its display is off lights it for the seat's
   next owner (`plans/DISPLAY.md`).

### G9.3 The lockout is the account's

The authority meters each login name on its own (G4), so the greeter's
countdown (`wait::Cooldown`) belongs to the account it was reported for: it
is shown, ticked and enforced only while the surface asks about that
account. Stepping back and picking another account never finds the first
one's wait on its prompt or holding back its secret, and returning to the
first finds it still counting.

## Security review notes

- **The greeter is untrusted by the authority.** Every field of every
  request is bounds- and shape-checked; the caller's identity is the
  kernel-attested origin, never a claim in the message; the reply set
  cannot be widened by the caller.
- **No ambient authority.** The greeter cannot start a process of any kind
  or read a file. The authority chooses the program (§16.5's desktop bundle
  path, one spelling) from its own constant, never from the request.
- **Secrets.** The secret exists in exactly two buffers — the greeter's
  field and the authority's request buffer — both volatile-wiped on every
  exit path, and a half-typed one is dropped with its surface when the
  screen goes to sleep (G9.2). It never reaches swap unencrypted (§4), a
  log, or `stdinfo`.
- **Enumeration.** The account list is disclosed only to the attested
  greeter account. A machine that would rather not disclose it uses the
  `Other…` tile only; that is a store setting, not a second code path.
- **Denial of service.** A greeter that cannot start, cannot acquire the
  seat, or repeatedly dies degrades the round to the text login. The
  machine is always loggable-into.

## Testing

Covered in host unit tests:

- the `continue` operand grammar, including both rejection shapes (an
  unknown word and more than one operand) and the REPL staying open;
- the `BootSession` wire round-trip and its fail-closed decode, the
  `lib/rt` wrapper's fail-closed mapping, the `abi-sys` stub marshalling;
- the set-once kernel cell (empty reads `Unset`, first install wins, a
  second does not overwrite) and the kernel install path from a supervisor
  `continue gui`;
- the `effective_session_kind` precedence over every
  (override × stored default) pair;
- the surface state machine: editing, submit-once, the secret erased after
  a verified, a refused *and* an unreachable verdict, refusal and
  unreachable reading differently, and no event concluding the surface
  without a verified verdict;
- the surface render: the column centred both ways and non-overlapping at
  100 % and 200 %, every band actually painting inside the rectangle the
  layout claims for it, the chrome in the top corners in the muted ink with
  the clock keeping its room on a narrow screen, a cut line ending in the
  shared mark, the chrome identical whichever body is up, a usable prompt on a
  640×480 screen, the block never exceeding the screen, scaling from 25 % to
  800 %, `None` rather than a panic on a zero-extent screen, and every pixel
  a keystroke paints falling inside the hit-tested field;
- legibility on both themes: the clock (in the muted ink), name, notice and
  field reach at least half the separation the theme itself promises between
  that ink and the desktop colour — a bar derived from the palette, so it
  cannot be quietly lowered, and one that fails outright if no glyphs are
  drawn;
- the pointer: the placed origin is the pointer minus the hotspot, the drawn
  pixels fall only inside the cursor's rectangle, a move presents exactly
  the clipped union of the old and new rectangles and leaves nothing behind,
  a move that moves nothing presents nothing, and a cursor that will not
  rasterise leaves a working screen;
- the chooser: focus movement in both directions with wrap-around, the
  `Other…` tile with no accounts and with many, `Escape` returning to the
  chooser and wiping the secret, the live badge, and the paint rectangle
  equalling the hit-test rectangle;
- the cooldown: a submit refused without the verifier being called, the
  secret still erased, clearing, and being dropped when stepping between
  accounts;
- the backdrop: a scene showing through behind the column untouched; over
  its own ground the scene frame byte for byte the flat one; a line of text
  over a bright scene inking ground the plain draw leaves showing, tile
  labels included; only a scene asking for a shadow at all; and every pixel
  any stage draws inside `column_rect`, which no stage, keystroke or step
  back moves;
- damage: every pixel a keystroke, a verdict, a focus move, and a clock
  tick change lying inside the reported rectangle;
- `session-v1` encode/decode round-trips and a fail-closed refusal for
  every malformation, plus an arm in the `lib/abi` wire-decoder fuzz
  harness;
- the broker: the placement and per-request identity gates, byte-identical
  refusals across every failure mode, the empty page for an unauthorised or
  undecodable request, paging past the end, the request buffer wiped, and
  no secret in any audit field;
- the attempt budget: free attempts, the doubling cap, per-account
  isolation, success reset, table-full eviction, and the all-cooling-down
  fallback;
- the session table: the single-foreground invariant after every mutation,
  switch-away, switch-back, logout, a session that dies while background,
  two accounts alternating, and the newest-first exit drain;
- the greeter service: bounded multi-page account loading (including a
  lying `total`), each verdict mapping, the request buffer wiped after
  every outcome, an unreachable authority keeping the surface alive, zero
  accounts still logging in by typed name, the park deadline being the
  nearest of the clock tick, the cooldown, the ribbon's frame and the
  display's sleep, and damage-only presentation;
- the ribbon: its layer lit and the column's clear space dark, a frame
  presenting only what it moved and painting nothing of the column, no
  stale pixel however many frames have gone out, one frame a frame on, none
  under reduced motion, and none while asleep;
- the sleep: nothing before thirty idle minutes and any input putting it off,
  black presented before the switch, nothing presented and nothing armed
  while asleep, the waking input reaching nothing, a half-typed secret
  erased, a display with no power control kept black, a refused switch
  named, a refused wake staying dark until the next input, and the pointer
  following the hand;
- the lockout held back only on the account it was reported for, and still
  counting when that account is picked again;
- **the two halves against each other**: `tests/session_v1.rs` wires the
  greeter's transport straight to the authority's handler, so the client
  and server are proven to agree rather than each agreeing with a mock;
- the desktop side: the seat released only *after* an accepted
  step-aside, a refusal leaving the session drawing, a background park with
  no deadline, a foreground wake re-acquiring and re-moding a **changed**
  display mode, an `End` wake exiting cleanly, and an unattested or
  undecodable wake ignored.
