# FIGURE.md — parametric figures: shared primitives, the game rig, and provable art quality

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This plan owns **how a character exists**: the
parametric shapes a figure is drawn from, the skeleton that places them, the
pose parameters and clips that move them, and — the part that matters most —
the harness that makes "the art is good" a **measured, gated property** instead
of an opinion.

It is deliberately split across two homes, because exactly one part of it is
general and the rest is a game's:

| Half | Home | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| The parametric **outline primitives** — a superellipse, a taper, a wedge, a scalloped panel, a bevelled panel, a splat — and their tracer | `lib/raster::shape` | Two independent consumers (`cinder` and the game) and no game semantics: they are 2D vector primitives feeding the scan converter `lib/raster` already owns, sitting beside `fill_round_rect`. |
| **Everything with character semantics** — rigs, joint limits, equipment sockets, draw order, the body frame, pose parameters, clips, blending, the transition machine, motion layers, character parameter spaces, the designer, the art harness's measurements | `userland/games/wintersun/figure` | A rig is game content, not OS infrastructure. `lib/*` is the OS's shared-library namespace and a figure engine has no business in it. |

That line is the whole organisational decision, and it is drawn at "does this
carry meaning about a *creature*?". A taper is geometry; a *limb* is anatomy.
The primitive is shared under its geometric name and the anatomy stays with the
consumer that means it — which is also why the shared names are `Taper` and
`Splat` rather than `Limb` and `Fur`.

A figure's own body is **not** drawn from those primitives — §2 says why, and
the short version is that a flat outline cannot be placed correctly under a
three-axis rotation. `lib/raster::shape` stays shared for what it is good at:
`cinder`'s whole cat, and the ground ellipse a figure's contact shadow is.

`cinder` therefore migrates only its **shape** code (FG1) and keeps its own
skeleton, gait, pose model and mind exactly where they are. It never depends on
the game: `userland/games/*` is a leaf subtree nothing outside may depend on
(§17.4), so that dependency could not exist even if someone tried.

Read first (§15.18): `plans/CINDER.md` §B2 (the proven shape vocabulary and
skeleton this generalises), `AGENTS.md` §10 (asset tiers and DPI), §27
(foundational primitives are complete, not minimal), `plans/WINTERSUN.md` §1
(the games subtree) and §4, `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` (the designer's
controls), `lib/raster` and `lib/util::mathf` rustdoc.

## Ledger

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FG0 | This plan, the jump-sheet row, the §3 map entry, the `PLAN.md` section | done |
| FG1 | `lib/raster::shape`: the six outline primitives, the tracer, the build-time vertex bounds, and `cinder` migrated onto them with its existing tests as the acceptance gate | done |
| FG2 | `wintersun/figure`: the rig — skeleton, joint hierarchy with limits, named equipment sockets, draw order, the one body frame that serves every heading, and the skinned meshes a part is drawn as | done |
| FG3 | Pose parameters, clips (keyframed parameter curves with easing), clip blending, and the transition state machine | done |
| FG4 | Procedural layers over a clip: gait phase from distance travelled, look-at, recoil, cloth and hair sway, breathing, per-foot terrain planting, the clip-authored root height, root motion and the figure's root placement, contact shadow | done |
| FG5 | `cargo xtask artsheet`: the shipped motion set, the painter, the contact-sheet renderer, the committed ledger, and the automated quality checks | done |
| FG6 | The parameter space: species and build parameters, the palette model, validated bounds, and the compact serialised form a character record stores | done |
| FG7 | The designer engine: the parameter model, live preview, picking a preset, and randomised-but-plausible generation | done |
| FG8 | The run's mid-stance dip: a foot path that compresses at midstance and extends at toe-off, the run's leg keys re-solved through it, and its root height dipping to match | done |

Items are built in ledger order; each is complete — tests, docs, green gate —
before the next begins.

## 0. The problem this plan actually solves

Hand-drawn sprite sheets are how this kind of game is normally made, and they
are the wrong answer here for reasons that are structural rather than a matter
of taste:

- **Eight headings × N clips × M frames × every equipment combination** is a
  combinatorial explosion of artwork that no one can author or keep consistent,
  and equipment then cannot be mixed at all without redrawing it.
- **A sprite sheet is unreviewable by a test.** A regression in it is invisible
  until a human looks, so it rots silently.
- **It does not scale with DPI.** §10 requires every desktop length to resolve
  through one scale factor; a fixed-resolution sprite either blurs or aliases.
- **It cannot be generated honestly by an AI contributor**, which is the
  practical point. Asked for a 16-frame run cycle as pixels, a language model
  produces something that looks approximately right and is wrong in exactly the
  ways that matter — sliding feet, popping joints, inconsistent silhouettes,
  drifting palettes. Committing that and calling it art is the failure mode
  this plan is written to make impossible.

The alternative already works in this tree. `cinder.app` draws a cat from
**sixty-four parametric parts on a skeleton**, with pose parameters as data, one
body frame so a single rig serves every heading, worst-case vertex counts
asserted at build time, and host tests over the shapes, the gait, and the
painter. It is legible, it is scalable, it is reviewable, and every property
that can be stated as a number is stated as one.

So: generalise it, and then make quality measurable.

## 1. FG1 — the shared primitives, and `cinder`'s migration

`lib/raster::shape` owns the primitives. The set generalises
`cinder/src/shape.rs` without acquiring any game meaning:

| Primitive | The geometry | What a consumer uses it for |
|---|---|---|
| `Superellipse { rx, ry, square }` | an ellipse pulled `square` of the way to its bounding box — corners round while flats stay flat | trunks, skulls, haunches, eyes |
| `Taper { length, top, foot }` | a taper from an origin to a rounded end, rotated about that origin | arms, legs, tails, weapon shafts |
| `Wedge { half_width, height, lean }` | a leaning wedge with a tucked base | ears, horns, blade tips, spurs |
| `ScallopedPanel { rx, ry, folds }` | a panel with a scalloped hem | cloaks, skirts, banners, tabards |
| `BevelledPanel { rx, ry, bevel }` | a hard-edged panel with a bevelled rim | armour, shields, buckles, metal |
| `Splat { radius }` | a radial blob with a deterministic angular ripple | fur, hair, foliage, smoke |

Every name states the *geometry*; the third column is the consumer's business
and is documentation, not API. That is the rule that keeps this from being
disguised game content in `lib/*`: `cinder`'s cat calls a `Taper` a leg in its
own rig table, and `lib/raster` never learns that legs exist.

`Wedge` is `cinder`'s `Ear` renamed to state what it is rather than where it
was first used. `BevelledPanel` is the one genuinely new primitive, because
armour drawn as a superellipse reads as flesh. Anything a primitive cannot
state is a *composition* of primitives, never a seventh variant added for one
asset (§2.3).

`Splat` is the judgement call in the set, and worth naming as one: it was
written for cat fur. It is kept because a radial blob with deterministic edge
irregularity is equally foliage, smoke, a blot or a starburst — general
geometry that happens to have had a creature as its first caller. If a reviewer
disagrees, the alternative is for both consumers to carry it privately, which
is the duplication §2.2 forbids; it is not to keep it in `lib/*` under a
creature's name.

Every outline is filled through `lib/raster`'s single anti-aliased scan
converter — no second rasteriser (§2.2) — into `lib/inline` fixed arrays, so
the outline path touches no allocator. Each shape's worst-case vertex count is
asserted against the buffer at **build** time, so a generator given more detail
fails the build rather than silently truncating a ring into a shape nobody
authored. That rule is `cinder`'s and it is kept.

**`cinder` migrated in the same change**, so no private copy survives beside
the shared one. Only its `shape.rs` moved: its skeleton, gait, roam and mind
stayed where they are, because those are one creature's content. Its shape
tests moved with the code and now cover the module in `lib/raster`; its
remaining 146 tests and the desktop-companion QEMU vertical passed unchanged,
which is what says the pixels are unchanged. `cinder` uses five of the six —
`BevelledPanel` has no consumer there — and `Splat` still carries no outline,
because the soft composite that draws it is `cinder`'s `fur`, not a shared
primitive.

What the module now guarantees: outlines in shape-local pixels with `y` up,
every one symmetric about its local vertical axis bar the leaning `Wedge`,
traced into `lib/inline` fixed arrays whose worst case is asserted against
`MAX_VERTICES` at build time, and filled through the one anti-aliased scan
converter. A caller that asks for more detail than the buffer holds fails the
build rather than drawing a truncated ring.

## 2. FG2 — the rig (game-side)

A `Rig` in `wintersun/figure` is a skeleton: joints in a parent-relative hierarchy, each with a rest
transform and **documented rotation limits**; parts bound to joints with a
body-local offset; a draw order that is the skeleton's own, so a piece of
piping stays behind the flap it edges; and named **sockets** where equipment
attaches (hand, off-hand, head, back, shoulder, hip, foot).

Two rules carry most of the visual quality:

- **A joint that bears a limb also carries its mass.** Each limb's joint is
  also where the trunk carries a shoulder or haunch, from one table, so a
  swinging shank can never open a gap at the shoulder. Legs that floated below
  the body were the defect this closes in `cinder`, and it generalises exactly.
- **One body frame serves every heading.** A figure is not drawn from
  per-direction sprite sets. Its parts are placed in a body frame that is
  rotated by the heading and whose depth axis is foreshortened by the figure's
  own drawing elevation, and they paint far-first by projected depth — so
  eight or sixteen headings need no new artwork and no `cfg`. This is
  `cinder`'s insight and it is the single largest saving in the whole design.
  A figure's **size does not vary with depth**: the world projection is
  orthographic (`wintersun/app`'s `Camera`), so a figure whose scale tracked
  its ground row would grow and shrink as the camera scrolled. The
  foreshortening applies to the figure's own frame, not to its size.
  `plans/WINTERSUN.md` WS32 turns the world to a perspective view, and this
  rule changes with it.

Equipment is parts on sockets with their own palette, so gear is visible,
mixable, and costs no new art path. A helm is a `Plate` and a `Wedge`, not a
redrawn head.

### A part is a skinned mesh, not a billboard

The rig first drew each part as one of the §1 outlines, placed from an
origin, a screen angle and the bone's own length. That cannot work, and FG5's
harness measured how badly: against the shipped walk a thigh's drawn end
missed the knee it hangs from **by up to a third of the figure's height**.

```
facing east:  thigh drawn end (-12.07,-37.72)   knee at (+12.07,-37.72)
facing south: thigh drawn end (  9.00,-28.00)   knee at (  9.00,-22.97)
```

Two independent defects, and neither is a bug to be fixed in place. The
screen angle was a projection of a three-axis rotation vector onto the one
axis a billboard can turn about, and its *sense* was inverted — every swung
limb was drawn swinging the wrong way at every heading but the degenerate
ones. And the outline was drawn at the bone's authored length while the
projection shortens a limb pointing into the scene by twenty to thirty per
cent. A flat outline placed from three numbers has no way to end where its
child joint is.

So a part is a **mesh**: a run of cross-section rings along a spine, each
ring carried by the joint chain in three dimensions and then projected
vertex by vertex. There is no placement left to get wrong — a limb's far end
*is* its child joint, at whatever length and angle the heading leaves it,
exactly, everywhere.

- **Skinned, so a joint bends rather than creases.** A ring states how far
  it is carried by the part's *end* joint rather than its own. The last ring
  of a spanning part is carried wholly by the far joint, which is what puts
  the surface's end exactly where that joint is; the rings before it take
  the blend, which is what makes the bend smooth. A gated test holds every
  seam rigid across eight headings and six poses.
- **Drawn as shaded strips, so a limb reads as round.** The visible half of
  each ring is split into four arcs and each becomes one closed strip down
  the part, filled at the tone its own surface normal takes from the light.
  The tone is rounded to a fixed ladder, so the whole figure stays drawable
  in a small, exactly-known set of colours — which is what lets the harness
  check the palette by equality and count separable regions at all.
- **No new rasteriser and no depth buffer.** A strip is a closed contour
  filled through `lib/raster`'s existing scan converter, and parts are
  depth-sorted exactly as before. The shipped figure traces 688 outline
  points against the billboard's 468, so it is not the dearer design.
- **Still no allocator.** A part holds its rings in a fixed array and a
  placement holds its strips in another; nothing on the path allocates.
- **Placing is a fifth of what a figure costs.** Posing, planting and
  carrying every ring to the screen costs about 21 µs a figure on one core of
  the development host (`wintersun/app`'s `tests/budget.rs` prints it), and
  the heading's cosine and sine are worked out once per figure
  (`frame::Heading`) rather than per projected point.
- **Every free end is closed.** An open tube shows its own near rim as a
  crescent where the surface should have ended — at the crown of a head that
  reads as a notch cut out of it, and at a shoulder as a wing. Capping is
  data, not code: the first and last rings of an exposed end taper to a
  point.

What the built rig guarantees: the hierarchy is a parents-first forest, so no
cycle can be spelled and a posture resolves in one forward pass; a joint that
bears a child carries a part of its own, and no child's origin lies beyond
everything its parent draws (one-sided — a part's reach is an outer bound, so
exceeding it proves a gap while clearing it does not prove a seam, which the
mesh now makes structural rather than measured); a part that spans a bend
names a far joint that is genuinely its own joint's child, so the rest
transform between them exists; and a `Posture` refuses a rotation outside its
joint's limits, so an out-of-limit pose fails where it is authored rather than
on the frame. Rotations are right-handed about the body axes with no sign
flipped, so a part hanging below its joint turns opposite to the joint's own
`forward` — which makes an outward splay a different sign on each side, and
the humanoid's shoulder and hip roll limits handed. The shipped humanoid is 17
joints and 21 skinned parts authored in percentages of its standing height,
with both sides mirrored from one pass. Nothing in the crate allocates.

## 3. FG3/FG4 — animation

**Pose parameters are data, not code paths.** A `Pose` is a closed set of
named scalars — spine bend, twist and tilt, head turn, nod and tilt, and per
side the shoulder swing and splay, elbow bend, wrist angle, hip swing and
splay, knee bend and ankle angle — and a figure is drawn from one pose. A
`Clip` is a keyframed curve per parameter with an easing per segment, a
duration, and a loop mode. Blending is a weighted sum of poses with per-clip
masks, so a cast animation can play on the upper body while the legs keep
walking.

**A parameter is a fraction of the joint's own travel, which is what makes a
clip rig-independent and an illegal pose unspellable.** The rig's `Drive`
table says which joint axis a parameter turns and which way its `+1` points,
so the angle is scaled into that axis's documented interval. A clip names no
joint and no angle and therefore plays on any rig declaring the same
parameters; the handedness of an outward splay is stated once in that table
rather than in every clip that lifts an arm; and a bent-backwards elbow is
not a pose that gets rejected but one that cannot be written down, because
the elbow's parameter runs from straight to fully folded and has no other
end. Three rules keep that structural rather than checked: `Rigging::new`
refuses two drives on one joint axis so no two parameters can sum past it, no
easing overshoots so an interpolated value stays between its keys, and a
blend is a weighted mean so it stays between its inputs. The only clamping
anywhere absorbs floating-point rounding on a value already mathematically
inside. Overshoot is not an omission: the snap of a recoil and the settle of
a follow-through are damped layers below, where they can be bounded on their
own terms rather than smuggled into a keyframe.

**A pose is articulation only; everything that moves the root is FG4.** A
jump's lift, the pelvis drop of a crouch and a dodge's displacement are
translations of the figure's root, and none can be decided without the ground
the feet are standing on. They therefore sit with the foot-planting and
root-motion layers below rather than being split across both items, and a
crouch is authored as hip, knee and ankle bend whose ground contact FG4
resolves. The pelvis is left undriven by any parameter for the same reason:
it is the root, and turning it tilts the whole figure, which is the slope
response FG4 owns.

**The root transform is the placement's, not the pelvis joint's.** FG4 carries
the figure's root as a rigid transform of the whole body — a `Body` offset in
figure-local units and a `Rotation` — held on the `Stance` that `Posture::place`
takes, and seeded into the resolve as the frame the parentless joints hang in.
Two measurements decide it against the alternative of rolling the pelvis joint.
The pelvis's roll limit is +/-0.20 rad, which across the humanoid's 18-unit
stance absorbs 3.58 units of height difference, a slope of 11.2 degrees; the
planting reach the tilt exists to back up is the leg's own span travel, 29.9
units, a slope of 59.0 degrees. A fallback that saturates five times earlier
than the thing it backs up is no fallback. Independently, a pelvis roll pivots
about the pelvis and swings the feet sideways through the ground, where a
whole-figure tilt must pivot about the ground contact — which is the body
frame's origin and so the placement's, not any joint's. Offsetting the surface
ground point instead was rejected for a third reason: it is a second, unscaled
convention beside the figure-local units every other authored length uses, and
it drops the depth component a root displacement has.

**Blending weighs each parameter, not each pose.** A parameter is weighed
only against the clips that had an opinion about it, which is what makes a
mask mean anything, and a parameter nothing wrote resolves to rest. That
fixes how partial animations compose: an overlay covering part of the body is
layered *over* a base covering the rest — added to the same blend — rather
than cross-faded against it, since cross-fading a full-body clip out from
under a partial one would leave the uncovered half at rest as the base's
weight reached zero.

A `Transitions` state machine selects clips from the simulation's state
(grounded, speed, action, stagger) with per-edge blend durations. The machine
is data and is validated at load: every state reachable, every clip referenced
present, every blend duration positive. A cross-fade carries the root height
as well as the pose — `Animator::root` weighs each live clip's own height as
`Animator::blend` weighs its curves — so the body neither drops nor jumps when
one clip gives way to another.

**A clip also carries named events at phases** — `footstep`, `hit_frame`,
`loose`, `cast_release` — which is the seam the game's combat timing is built
on (`plans/WINTERSUN.md` §5, "Game feel"): a hitbox opens and a sound plays on
the frame the art shows it, rather than on a timer that drifts from the
animation. The events are part of the clip because that is the only place the
phase is known; what a consumer *does* with `hit_frame` is the consumer's
business, and the engine never learns what a hitbox is. An event at a phase
outside `0..=1`, or a clip declaring an event name twice, is refused at load.

Over the clip sit **procedural layers**, which is where animation stops looking
keyframed:

- **Gait phase is driven by distance travelled, not by a timer.** Feet are
  planted as a function of position, so a walk cannot slide, cannot skate when
  the speed changes, and cannot walk on the spot. `cinder`'s `roam` already
  proves this is the difference between motion and the appearance of it.
- **Look-at** rotates head and eyes toward a target within the joint limits.
- **Recoil and follow-through** displace the rig briefly on an impact or a
  loose, and settle on a damped curve — the thing whose absence makes an
  attack feel weightless.
- **Cloth, hair, and tail** are damped springs driven by acceleration and the
  wind vector, so a cloak trails the turn instead of rotating with it.
- **Breathing** is a small always-on cycle, which is what stops an idle figure
  reading as a paused one.
- **Feet are planted on the ground, not on the ground's average.** The world
  generator produces real slopes, so a figure standing across a gradient has
  one foot higher than the other; without correction both feet sit at the
  root's height and visibly float on the uphill side and sink on the
  downhill. Each foot is therefore solved to its own terrain height within a
  stated reach, and the excess is absorbed up the chain — the pelvis drops
  toward the lower foot and the supporting knee takes the bend, within the
  joint limits FG2 declares. A slope steeper than the reach allows tilts the
  whole figure rather than tearing the rig. **This is a correctness
  requirement, not polish**: a camera looks straight at the ground-contact
  line, which is exactly where the error is most visible. The ground a foot
  is planted on is the ground the view *draws*: WinterSun draws its world
  from directly above with height shown by shading alone, so its feet meet a
  level plane everywhere and its actor plants on the level, wading figures
  standing on the bed below the drawn water; the per-foot solve is for a view
  that draws relief as geometry.
- **Root motion where a clip needs it.** A dodge, a lunge and a stagger
  displace the figure by an amount the *clip* owns, so the animation and the
  movement cannot disagree. The authoritative displacement stays the
  simulation's (a client cannot move itself by playing an animation); the clip
  supplies the curve the simulation's own move follows.
- **A contact shadow** at the ground point, squashed by the light direction and
  fading with height — the trick that makes a jump readable.

**The height a foot is asked for is the clip's own, not the ground.** Two
defects the art harness surfaced, both in how the planting solve read a pose.
Putting *both* feet on the terrain flattened a walk's swing arc into a
shuffle; and because the pelvis sits at the rig's own fixed height, a foot
cannot travel fore and aft along level ground without the whole figure
sinking — so a walk authored with folded legs was left hovering over the floor
by exactly that fold. Each foot is therefore asked for the height the clip put
it at, raised by the terrain beneath it: a planted foot lands and a swing foot
keeps its arc, with neither picked out from the other, and on flat ground the
articulation comes back untouched for *any* pose.

**The height the body is at is authored, because the articulation cannot be
asked.** Both legs folded is a deep crouch and a run's flight phase at once.
Inferring the height from the *lesser* fold — the rule FG4 originally shipped
— gets a stance right and a flight exactly wrong: on the shipped run it sank
the figure 1.05 units of its hundred at the moment it should have been
highest, over the quarter of the cycle with neither foot down. A clip
therefore carries a root-height curve (`clip::Lift`), dimensionless like every
other authored animation value — a fraction of a straight leg, so one curve
holds on a taller rig — with zero at a straight leg's sole on the ground,
negative standing into the legs, and positive off the ground. Past a whole leg
either way it is a move the simulation authorised, and refused.

This is the clip-authored root height the plan previously recorded as
crossing the FG3 line. It does not: a `Lift` is a clip-carried curve the FG4
root layer consumes, exactly as `Travel` already is, and no part of it is a
pose parameter — "a pose is articulation only" stands unchanged. What it does
retire is the weaker claim that the root is always *derived* from the ground.

**Agreement between the two halves is measured, not assumed.** Nothing in the
solve makes a clip's stated height match its own leg keys, so a clip claiming
to stand upright while folding its legs would put its feet through the floor.
Instead: over a whole cycle the lowest either foot ever reaches must be the
floor exactly — below it the foot sinks in, above it the figure never lands.
One quantity's two signs, so `quality::grounding` answers both with one
number, and it needs no notion of which foot is "down": a contact band widens
near a foot's lowest point, where its height is flat, and reports a foot
planted well into its own toe-off. What it measures on the shipped set is the
sag between keys: a leg's angles are interpolated linearly, so the foot they
put down arcs slightly below the line its path holds it to, deepest halfway
between keys — the bound is that key spacing's sag rather than a judgement
about art, and six-place rounding adds under a hundred-thousandth of a unit
to it. The run's is the worst: 0.061 units on the reference human, scaling
with the leg to 0.067 on the long-legged elf and 0.073 on the tallest,
longest-legged build a record describes.

The run's body sinks into each stance and rises out of it, and follows a
parabola across each flight (§8).

Every layer is a pure function of (pose, state, time) and is host-tested
against its stated property, not against a screenshot.

## 4. FG5 — making quality provable

This is the heart of the plan. Three mechanisms, and none of them is
optional.

### The golden is a committed ledger; the sheets are on-demand output

`cargo xtask artsheet` walks the shared reference grid — every shipped motion,
at eight phases, facing four ways, at the three pixel sides the desktop draws
a figure at — renders each cell, measures it, and holds every number against a
bound. `--write` regenerates, the bare form verifies and fails closed, and it
runs in `ci` beside `font-atlas`.

**The committed golden is text, not a picture.** A committed PNG reproduces
§0's own objection one layer up: a reviewer cannot read a binary diff, so a
regression stays invisible until somebody opens the file, and git carries the
churn on every rig, clip, shape or palette change.
`userland/games/wintersun/figure/artsheet.ledger` is one row per cell —
identity, a pixel digest, and every measured number — so a change reads as
`skate 0.002718 -> 0.014803` in the diff. `--sheets` renders the pictures on
demand into the gitignored `images/artsheet/`, which is what makes the thing a
human judges always current rather than as-of-last-regeneration.

The bare form does **both** halves: it regenerates the ledger and compares it
byte for byte, *and* it checks the freshly measured numbers against their
bounds. Drift alone would admit a regression somebody had regenerated; bounds
alone would admit a change nobody noticed.

**A cell holds the whole figure.** The depth axis draws what is nearer the
viewer lower on the screen, so the near foot of a stride lands below the
ground point the figure stands on — a fifth of its reach below it for the
longest-legged build. A cell is framed by the figure's rest reach with two
measured allowances per motion (`reference::allowance`), above the ground
point and below it, between margins of a fiftieth of the side — 1.02 and
0.20 of the reach for locomotion, and never tighter for any other motion, so
no motion's cells draw a figure larger than a stride's: every ring of every
build corner of every species, in each shipped motion at every sixteenth of a
turn, stays inside its motion's allowances, and every cell of the grid inside
its square. A frame that left room only for the figure's height cut the feet
off over half the cells, and the checks below measured what was left.
Coverage is restated at locomotion's framing, so a motion framed looser is not
read as its figure drawn thinner.

### Automated quality checks, per cell

Each measurement has a bound beside it — the pose-side ones in
`figure::quality`, the pixel-side ones in the harness — and a bound is never
widened to admit a change.

- **Joint limits.** Every sampled pose is turned into a `Posture`, which
  refuses an out-of-limit rotation, and the excursion is read back off the
  rotations the posture actually holds. The bound is below one on purpose: a
  clip pinned at a limit reads as a rig fighting itself and leaves the overlay
  layers nowhere to go. Shipped worst: 0.86, the draw.
- **Foot slide.** Consumed from `Gait::fitted`/`Gait::slide` and divided by the
  stride, so the bound is dimensionless. The contact window is read over the
  ground, at the height the clip holds the body. Shipped worst: 0.0027 of a
  stride, the walk's, about a sixth of a pixel over a whole cycle at the
  largest drawn size.
- **Motion continuity.** The largest second difference of any parameter, or of
  the root height, across a cycle, per unit of the range it is authored in,
  taken cyclically for a clip that joins. It separates a pop from a keyed
  curve's own faceting rather than measuring how finely the curve was keyed.
  Shipped worst: 0.041.
- **Loop closure.** How far a looping clip's last pose sits from its first. The
  shipped tables are authored to join exactly, so the bound is rounding.
- **Grounding.** Over a cycle, how far the lowest point either foot reaches
  sits from the floor — penetration and hover being one quantity's two signs.
  Worst: 0.070 units, a preset elf's run.
- **Penetration**, for a figure the ground does not hold up — falling,
  swimming, climbing: no foot may pass below the floor, though every foot may
  leave it. Shipped worst: none.
- Which of these a motion is held to is read off what it is
  (`quality::Measured`): closure only for a looping clip, skate only for a
  stride, grounding for a figure on its feet and penetration otherwise.
- **Silhouette readability**, three measured numbers per cell: the
  alpha-weighted **coverage ratio** inside a band; the count of **connected
  tonal regions**; and the **contrast ratio** against both themes' desktops.
  A palette is the player's to choose, so beyond the grid the harness draws
  every dye on each species' palest and darkest build at the floor and holds
  each cell to the same bounds, bounds only, with no ledger rows. The bound is
  three regions; the ledger's worst row resolves into four.
- **Budget.** Outline points per figure and fill area per cell, so a rig
  cannot quietly become the frame's cost centre.

### What the grid does not sample

The grid's eight phases are eighths, and the run's flight windows run from
`RUN_STANCE` to a half and from a half plus `RUN_STANCE` to one — so the
samples land on their *boundaries*, where the root arc meets the stance
height and contributes nothing. The sheets therefore do not show a figure
mid-flight, and this is why the inverted flight dip (§3) survived FG5's gate:
the harness never rendered a phase at which it was visible. Within a stance
the eighths fall a third and two thirds of the way through, where the run's
body is three quarters of its dip down; midstance, where it is lowest, falls
between them.

The curve is gated regardless — the digest folds it on its own sixteenths,
which cross both flight windows and both stances at their middle, and the
crate's own tests hold the dip's depth, the arc's rise, their ends and their
signs. What is still missing is a *picture* of either extreme a reviewer can
look at. Closing that means sixteen phases rather than eight, which doubles
the grid, the ledger and the four determinism verticals' work; it is recorded
here as a deliberate gap rather than taken silently.

### The honest limit

The readability check has a second consumer: `plans/WINTERSUN.md` §3 fixes the
renderer's degradation floor as the last detail level whose frames still clear
these bounds. The bounds are proven at the smallest drawn side,
`reference::SIDES[0]`, so the floor is the scale that still draws the smallest
figure a record describes (`humanoid::LEAST_REACH`) at that side:
`actor::readable` answers it for a view's scale and `app::quality::Ladder`
stops the render scale there. No frame measures readability. So a change that
loosens these numbers does not merely admit a worse contact sheet; it lets the
running game shed detail past the point a player can read it.

### What FG5 settled, and where it diverges from this plan as written

- **A contact sheet is output, not a golden** (above). Recorded because the
  original text said "PNG contact sheets committed to the tree".
- **Palette conformance is checked source-side.** Every strip's colour is held
  against the rig's own declared tones at the painter's own shading steps —
  exact, cheap, and stronger than a pixel check, which would need an
  antialiasing tolerance that could hide real drift. The *pixel* side classifies
  each pixel by its nearest declared shade, which is what makes the region count
  a count of separable masses rather than a colour search.
- **The gaits carry no `clip::Travel`.** The original text said walk and run
  would. They must not: a walk's displacement is the simulation's own and the
  *gait* paces it, so a travel curve would be a second pacing of one thing, and
  for a constant-speed cycle it is the identity ramp. `Travel` is for a move the
  animation paces, and the one shipped is the dodge's.
- **The shipped motion set is the seventeen clips WinterSun plays** (WS6):
  locomotion, the actions, and the states, each with its layer and its support.
  Their leg curves are not authored by eye: each states a **foot path** —
  strike distance, stance fraction, swing clearance, and how much of the leg's
  turn the ankle levels the foot by, with the foot on the floor wherever the
  clip holds the body while it is down — put through the planting layer's own
  two-bone solve (`plant::solve`), and an action's or a state's root height is
  computed from the same depth profile its legs are solved to. A test states each path whole
  and holds every key of every shipped leg table to it exactly; the only keys
  with no stated path are the dodge's in flight, where no foot is on anything.
  Another measures each gait's stride back out of its keys against the number
  its path was authored to give.
- **An action is timed from outside.** Its clip is authored across windup,
  active and recovery in phase, with the phases they meet at stated
  (`clip::Segments`); `clip::Timing` stretches each segment to the seconds the
  action's owner asks for, and the shipped seconds are each action's reference
  timing, which the game's action documents replace. Only a held clip can be
  an action, since a looping one has no end to recover to.
- **The figure gained a fourth cross-target digest.** `figure::digest` folds the
  complete placed-strip stream, the planting roots and misses, the gait's own
  phases and the quality numbers, over raw `f64::to_bits` with no quantisation.
  One vertical per Tier-1 target, matching `world_determinism` and
  `rules_determinism`. It and the ledger's pixel digests are taken over
  `lib/util::mathf`'s correctly rounded square root and fdlibm kernels and over
  headings exact along each axis (`plans/WINTERSUN.md` WS22), so a last-bit
  change there moves the digest and shows in the ledger as a few edge pixels.
- **The accessor audit ran, and kept three the letter of it would have cut.**
  Deleted for having no caller at all: `Clip::events`, `Travel::keys`,
  `Spring::damping`, `Recoil::spring`, `Contact::radius`, `Light::elevation`,
  and all four `Stance` readers — plus `frame::screen_turn`, which the mesh
  left with nothing to do. Kept where the only caller is a test that
  genuinely needs it: `Curve::keys` (the motion tests check the authored
  tables are evenly spaced, which is what the half-turn mirror depends on,
  and the alternative is enumerating the tables by name), `Breath::depth` and
  `Spring::rate` (both bound an assertion against the value the object was
  built with, rather than restating it). An accessor whose only caller is a
  *tautology* test went; one whose caller is a real assertion stayed.
- **The harness found two structural defects in FG2's placement and two in
  FG4's planting**, all fixed: the billboard could not place a limb (§2); the
  planting solve both flattened a walk's swing foot and left a crouching
  figure hovering over the ground; and it read the body's height off the
  lesser leg fold, which inverted a run's flight phase (§3). The last of those
  is what made a clip's root height authored rather than derived, and added
  `grounding` to the gated numbers below.

## 5. FG6/FG7 — the parameter space and the designer

**FG6.** A figure's identity is `figure::identity::Identity`, a
validated nineteen-byte record: a version byte, a species (human, elf, dwarf,
beastkin, dragonkin — chosen by the user), five build settings, a face shape,
an eye shape, an ear form, optional horns, tail and hair, a hair volume, and
five palette swatch indices (skin/fur/scale, hair, eyes, markings, cloth
accent). What each species may be is `figure::species` data: the interval
every build setting spans (height, girth, taper, limbs, head — girth and
taper together are the mass distribution), the ear, horn and tail forms it
admits, the eye colours it admits, and the swatch table its skin and markings
draw from. Every species stands on the one humanoid skeleton, so every clip
plays on all of them; a quadruped creature is a different rig and WS6
content, not a species of this record.

What the finished part guarantees:

- **Bounds are structural.** A build setting is a byte spanning its species'
  whole documented interval, exactly at both ends, so no setting can be out
  of range. What can be wrong is refused by name (`IdentityError` naming its
  `Field`): a byte naming no species, form or swatch; a form or eye colour
  the species does not carry; a second spelling (a bald figure's hair colour
  or volume, a human's markings, which must be zero). The decoder is total —
  every byte string answers a record or a refusal — and fails closed.
- **Every admitted record builds.** The fuzz harness (`tests/fuzz_identity`,
  registered with `cargo xtask fuzz`) holds that every record the decoder
  admits re-encodes to its own bytes and builds and places a figure, so a
  server's check and a renderer cannot disagree about what is drawable; a
  regression corpus pins the accept/reject verdicts at every field's edge.
- **The `&'static` ring borrow survives.** The record reaches geometry
  through joint offsets (values) and a five-factor `mesh::Stretch` applied to
  each surface's borrowed template at carry time; species and features choose
  between templates. No owned-rings tier exists: it would more than double a
  `Rig`, whose size, with the `Placement`'s, a test holds (about eight and
  fourteen kibibytes) because the QEMU verticals run the digest on a boot
  stack.
- **Height is height.** The builder scales the whole skeleton so the crown
  stands exactly at the height setting with the sole on the ground; limb and
  head proportion change shape, never stature. Every build keeps the
  thigh-to-shank proportion the foot paths were solved through, so every
  shipped clip stays inside its grounding and skate bounds at every build
  corner of every species — measured, not argued.
- **A palette edit is a re-tint.** A surface names a `tint::Tint` role; the
  rig holds the resolved colours and `Rig::retint` swaps them without touching
  geometry. Swatches are first-party tables, and the fixed trouser tone sits
  in the luminance band that clears both desktop themes on its own, so every
  palette is readable; the art harness checks that tone before any cell.
- **Layered surfaces sort by a shared point.** Hair is a cap over the crown,
  plus a mass behind where it reaches down the back; the cap and the skull
  share one sort point (`Part::sorted_at`) so the authored order decides at
  every heading and nod, where two means broke the tie with the tilt.
- **A tail moves.** The skeleton has a tail root on every figure, driven by
  `TailLift`/`TailSwing` like any joint; `Sway::overlay` turns it as an
  overlay, so the tail is the damped spring §3 says it is.
- **Gear fits every build.** A `Mount` carries the scale of the body at its
  socket, and fitted gear is scaled by it.
- **The grid covers the space.** The reference grid is each species'
  reference figure in every motion, plus each species' least, most and two
  plausible figures walking; between them they wear every form and each
  species' palest and darkest covering, and every cell clears every §4 bound.
  The digest folds all of it, each record's bytes included.

**FG7.** The designer engine is the parameter model, the preview it is
watched in, picking a preset, and plausible generation; the surfaces —
sliders, windows, the character library — and the preset set are the game's
(`plans/WINTERSUN.md` WS17, WS6). What the finished part guarantees:

- **An edit costs what it feeds, and nothing is written until it settles.**
  `design::Designer::edit` changes the record in memory and nothing else. What
  a repaint owes is `design::Change::between` the record last drawn and the one
  now live — `Nothing`, `Tints` (only the palette changed; `Rig::retint`, no
  point moves) or `Rig` (species, build or features changed; a rebuild) — so
  any burst of edits between two paints costs one catch-up, and the preview
  catching up by that diff is what makes it so. `Designer::settle` answers the
  record to write only when the store does not hold it already: a drag of any
  length is at most one write. Persisting it is the surface's, through
  `lib/util`'s `JobDesk`.
- **An answer lands on what the player is not doing.** One write is out at a
  time, and its answer can arrive during the next drag. `Designer::landed`
  takes the store's record, and `Designer::refused` the one it kept, in every
  field not edited since the write went out; the drag in hand stays the
  player's. A settle made while a write is out is owed, and the answer hands
  it out — one write for however many settles it covers. An answer with no
  write out changes nothing.
- **The record is always one.** The designer holds the player's choices field
  by field and the canonical record they come to for the species chosen. An
  edit the species cannot carry is refused with the field `Identity::new`
  names, and changes nothing. A species change or going bald re-derives the
  other fields instead: a swatch past the new table is clamped, a form the
  species lacks becomes its first, a form it must carry is given (a dragonkin
  always has horns and the scaled tail), an eye colour it does not admit
  becomes the admitted one nearest in colour, and a bald figure's hair colour
  and volume are zeroed. The choices survive beneath — an edit to a field the
  record holds at zero (`Spec::fixed`) can only ask for that zero and leaves
  the choice beneath alone — so a round trip through any species, or through
  going bald, gives back exactly the figure it left.
  This projects the player's own choices; a record from anywhere else is still
  decoded and refused, never repaired.
- **The preview plays, on the grid's own stage.** `preview::Preview` plays the
  shipped motions through the FG3 animator — choosing a clip cross-fades into
  it, root height included — over a caller-held `motion::Clips` table, breathes,
  and stands on `reference`'s one stage: the same ground, light, breath and
  pose-to-placement path the harness measures. It views the figure framed two
  ways at once: `Frame::Measured` fills the square as the harness frames a cell,
  so the view at the smallest side is the readability floor, and
  `Frame::Shared` draws every figure at the one scale `humanoid::MOST_REACH`
  gives the largest figure a record describes — height is a scale of the whole
  skeleton, so a figure filling its own square is the same size at every
  height. Every view of one moment draws one pose. No edit reaches the clock,
  the clips playing, the breath or the heading.
- **A preset is a record.** Picking one is `Designer::apply` and a settle. The
  preset set is `WinterSun` bundle content in `Resources/` (WS6), not a table in
  this crate.
- **Randomised means plausible, not uniform.** `plausible::figure` draws from a
  bell about each setting's middle, with a heavy build leaning broad-shouldered
  and a tall one long-limbed and small-headed; hair and markings lean toward
  the lightness of the covering, the tunic away from it; optional forms are
  carried as often as the species' own `species::Forms` states, one number
  that also says whether it may go without and whether it carries one at
  all, so no species' odds can contradict its forms. It is
  integer-only and takes an injected `RandU64`: the predictable
  `NonCryptoRng` is the tier to use, because a figure a player could have built
  by hand protects nothing by being unpredictable, and a seed that names a
  figure is what the grid and the tests need. Two seeded draws per species are
  figures of the grid, so every generated figure is held to the bounds an
  authored one is.

## 6. Refused by name

- **A figure engine in `lib/*`.** Rigs, clips and character parameters are game
  content; `lib/*` is the OS's shared-library namespace. Only the geometric
  primitives are shared, and only under geometric names (§1).
- **Hand-drawn per-direction sprite sheets**, for the reasons in §0.
- **A seventh shape variant added for one asset.** Compose from the six.
- **A second rasteriser, blend, or outline path.** `lib/raster` owns them.
- **Runtime-loaded figure geometry from an untrusted source.** Parameters are
  validated data; geometry is first-party code.
- **Owned rings per figure.** A build is a stretch over a borrowed template;
  per-figure ring storage would more than double a rig for nothing.
- **Free colours in a record.** A palette is swatch indices into first-party
  tables, so no record can paint a figure the desktop cannot draw legibly.
- **Repairing a record.** A field outside what its species admits is refused
  with its name, never clamped or defaulted into something drawable. The
  designer's projection is of the player's own choices, not of a record.
- **A designer that writes per sample, or rebuilds for a colour.** An edit is
  live and in memory; the write waits for the settle, and a palette edit is a
  re-tint.
- **A random figure drawn uniformly**, or from an unpredictable generator: the
  first produces monsters and the second protects nothing.
- **Presets as engine tables.** A preset is a record and the set is bundle
  content (WS6).
- **Screenshot-diff tests as the only animation check.** They catch that
  something changed, never that it is wrong. The measurements in §4 are what
  state correctness; the sheets are for the human judgement that remains.
- **An `#[allow]` or a widened bound to make a quality check pass.** A failing
  readability, slide, or limit check is a real finding (§15.3, §2.18).

## 7. Verification

- The six shapes' outlines are traced within their asserted vertex bounds, and
  a generator exceeding one fails the build.
- `cinder`'s existing shape, paint, gait, roam, and vertical tests pass after
  the FG1 migration, with unchanged pixels where the shape is unchanged.
- Rig: joint limits enforced at the posture, so an out-of-limit rotation is
  refused where it is authored; a bearing joint without a part of its own, and
  a child beyond its parent's reach, are both refused at assembly; a limb's
  joint always carries its mass, measured by placing a posed figure and
  finding the cap and the limb at one point; draw order is the skeleton's, and
  reverses on the turnaround rather than needing a second set of parts; every
  socket resolves, and gear naming an unoffered one is refused rather than
  dropped. The projection's properties are numbers — the foreshortening is the
  elevation its doc claims, height is unforeshortened, depth is not the screen
  row, and the camera direction moves nothing on screen — not screenshots.
  Meshes: a carried ring sits where its joint puts it with its cross-section
  square to the surface; a ring bound to the far joint lands exactly where
  that joint does and one bound partway moves partway; the near arc is the
  half facing the camera and no point of it faces away; a flattened ring's
  normals come out of its flat side; the shading ladder is a closed, climbing
  set that a step past its end lands on rather than past. And the property the
  whole mesh exists for: two surfaces meeting at a joint are **rigidly**
  joined, over eight headings and six poses, to within rounding. `no_std` with
  no allocator, built on all four Tier-1 targets.
- Clips: curve evaluation at known keys and midpoints; loop closure, so a
  wrapping clip reads the same value either side of the join; no easing
  leaves the unit interval or goes backwards; a sampled value never leaves
  its parameter's range under any loop mode. A cross-fade's two weights sum
  to one, and a blend of values inside their ranges stays inside them — the
  general guarantee, since weight is normalised per parameter rather than
  required to sum to one. Malformed clips and machines are refused at load:
  an empty or non-ascending curve, a key or event outside `0..=1`, a keyed
  value outside its parameter's range, two curves on one parameter, a
  duplicated event name, a non-positive duration or cross-fade, a repeated or
  out-of-order edge, a state naming an absent clip, and a state nothing leads
  to. Events fire exactly once as the phase passes them, report a lap's tail
  before the next head in the order they happen, and survive a blended
  transition without duplicating or being dropped. A cross-fade carries the
  root height from the outgoing clip's to the incoming one's, starting where
  the one held it, landing where the other does, and never jumping between.
- Rigging: two drives on one joint axis are refused, so every parameter at
  either extreme — singly and all at once — leaves every joint of the shipped
  humanoid inside its limits; an elbow cannot be driven past straight at any
  value; an outward splay is outward on both sides and equal in magnitude;
  each half of a lopsided limit is scaled on its own, so rest stays rest.
  `no_std` with no allocator, built on all four Tier-1 targets.
- Layers: the gait phase follows distance rather than frames, so the same
  ground covered gives the same phase however it was divided and a figure
  held still does not walk on the spot; a known distance completes a known
  number of cycles, forward and backward, and the phase never leaves the
  half-open cycle. The stride is *measured* — fitted from the clip and rig,
  it recovers the one the test's walk was authored with to within a
  twentieth, and the planted foot then slides under a hundredth of a stride;
  a stride that is not the clip's own slides at least ten times further,
  which is what makes the fitting earn its answer. A clip whose foot never
  lifts has no stride and is refused rather than given an invented one, and
  a walk authored from mid-stance measures the same as one from the head of
  the cycle. A stance that sinks the body while its leg folds into it is
  fitted over the ground: its window spans the stance, so a stride a tenth
  off slides by a tenth of the ground the stance covers, where a window read
  through the body frame holds only the step's ends.
- Planting: on flat ground the solve is an **identity** — every parameter
  unchanged, at *any* authored root height, and the figure left at exactly the
  height its clip asked for — so a figure on the level is drawn precisely as
  its clip authored it; off it, each foot lands on its own terrain height to
  within a ten-thousandth, verified by resolving the solved pose rather than
  by trusting the solver's own arithmetic. The terrain correction drops to the
  lowest ground and never lifts; a slope inside the reach leaves the figure
  square and one past it leans, handed by which foot is higher; ground no leg
  can reach is reported as a miss rather than fudged. The height a clip states
  is what lands its planted foot, and a pose tucked into both legs rises with
  its clip rather than sinking by its fold — the flight-phase defect, as its
  own reproducer. A root beyond a whole leg either way is refused. Every
  solved pose stays inside its parameter ranges and is posturable, across a
  rest and a striding pose, five authored heights and the whole span of
  slopes. Reach, stance, sole and leg length come from the rig's own joint
  table, and a leg whose joints are not a chain is refused.
- Root height: a curve that does not span the cycle, one carrying a value past
  a whole leg either way, one whose keys do not ascend, and a *looping* clip
  whose height does not close on itself are each refused — the last at the
  clip, since the loop mode is the clip's to know, and the same curve is
  admitted on a clip that plays once and holds. A clip authoring no height
  reads as standing straight. The shipped idle and walk hold one height at
  every phase. The run sinks from each strike to midstance by exactly the dip
  it authored and rises again to toe-off, never turning back between, both
  steps alike; its arc clears the toe-off height by exactly the rise it
  authored, meets that height at both ends of both flight windows, and never
  dips below it across either. Every shipped height is inside a leg's own
  travel, and the rig's leg is the length the curves were authored against.
- Foot paths: every key of every shipped leg table — the idle's, the walk's
  and the run's hip, knee and ankle — is its clip's stated foot path put
  through `plant::solve`, to the six places it is written to. The solve
  itself puts a chain's end where it was aimed, across the reach from nearly
  straight to folded near the knee's limit, ahead, behind, above, below and a
  little to either side.
- Grounding: the shipped set's lowest foot sits on the floor to within the
  bound, and the measurement catches both of its failure directions — a crouch
  with no root height hovers and is rejected, and a root driven past the fold
  sinks by exactly as much again.
- Root placement: a lift moves every part by exactly itself and a tilt turns
  the figure about its ground contact rather than flinging a part outward;
  an unreal scale, anchor, offset or tilt is refused where the stance is
  built rather than where it is drawn.
- Springs: no step of any length, over six damping ratios from undamped to
  heavily overdamped, gains amplitude or leaves the numbers — the closed
  form is path-independent, so splitting a step in two gives the same answer
  as taking it whole. Every regime settles on its target; only an
  underdamped one overshoots, which is the follow-through. A recoil moves
  nothing until time passes, touches only what it struck, overshoots on the
  way back, and settles onto the clip. A sway hangs straight under steady
  motion, leans against an acceleration and with a wind, cannot be driven
  past its limit by any input, and comes back to rest after a thirty-second
  frame.
- Look-at: a target straight ahead moves nothing and one on the head itself
  is left alone; a reachable target is looked straight at; every target
  leaves the head nearer to it than it started; one out of reach stops at
  the limit with the pose still posturable; and the spine share moves work
  between spine and neck without changing the total turn.
- Root motion: the curve runs from none of the move to all of it or is
  refused, values outside that are refused, and the distance is the
  simulation's — so a move delivers exactly what was authorised however the
  clip paced it, including an anticipation that draws back first.
- Contact shadow: an overhead light lays the footprint flat and
  foreshortened; the solved screen ellipse matches the ground ellipse swept
  and projected the long way round, at every bearing; a lower light rakes it
  out along its own bearing only, and one near the horizon stops raking
  rather than running away; a rising figure's shadow slides away along the
  light and thins, and a figure below its ground point casts as if on it.
- Breathing is non-zero at idle, never exceeds its depth, moves chest and
  shoulders together, and leaves an already-extreme pose inside its ranges.
- `artsheet` verify mode fails on any drift *and* on any breached bound, and
  is part of `ci`'s static-gate group; every §4 check runs over every cell of
  the grid, at every drawn size, and over every dye on each species' palest
  and darkest build at the floor. Its PNG encoder is proven by round-tripping
  what it writes through `lib/image`'s own decoder rather than by eye.
- Continuity sees the root height: a body that steps by a fifth of a leg reads
  as the pop it is, and one that holds still reads as nothing.
- The figure digest is asserted by the host suite and by one vertical per
  Tier-1 target (`tests/integration/figure_determinism_*`), so a backend that
  lowered the same arithmetic differently would fail rather than diverge
  quietly.
- Parameter records: every grid figure round-trips exactly; every other
  length, every other version, every byte naming nothing, every form or eye
  colour a species does not carry, every swatch past its table and every
  second spelling is refused with its field; every single-byte change to
  every grid record is a different record or a refusal; both ends of every
  interval are exact. The fuzz harness holds that the decoder is total and
  that every admitted record re-encodes to itself and builds and places; the
  regression corpus pins the edge verdicts. Every admissible feature
  combination of every species builds at both build extremes, and the
  richest is exactly the part bound. Stature is measured off the carried
  rings at all 32 build corners of every species and equals the height
  setting with the sole on the ground; every shipped clip clears its
  grounding and skate bounds at every one of those corners.
- Layering: without a shared sort point a cap over a skull is hidden at some
  heading and nod, and with one it never is. A re-tint moves no point of any
  surface. Gear on a mount twice the size is drawn twice the size. A sway
  turns a tail joint by exactly its lean, through the tail's parameters, and
  nothing else.
- Designer: a simulated drag produces exactly one durable write and one
  catch-up per drained input burst — a rebuild for a build drag, a re-tint and
  never a rebuild for a palette drag — and no edit reaches the clock, the clips
  playing, the breath or the heading (§28.10, §28.11). A drag ending where it
  began writes nothing; a palette edit moves no joint or surface; every edit
  from every grid record either shows exactly the value it set or is refused by
  the field `Identity::new` names and changes nothing; a round trip through any
  species gives back the figure; a required form is given, a swatch clamped and
  given back, an eye colour replaced by the nearest admitted one; an edit of
  the zero a field is held at leaves the choice beneath it; and the
  projection turns any choices at all into a record and a record into itself.
  An answer or a refusal landing during the next drag leaves the drag in hand
  and puts every other field where the store's record has it; a store
  answering another record wins where the player is not editing; a settle
  made meanwhile is owed and handed out by the answer, and an answer with no
  write out changes nothing. Every field reads back as the edit that sets it,
  and that edit writes it and no other. The fuzz harness (`tests/fuzz_design`)
  holds all of it over any edit sequence from any corpus record: the field an
  edit sets and every field it cannot reshape, the record each write carries,
  answers landing mid-drag, and round trips through every species and through
  going bald with every field held at zero written on the way.
- Preview: unmoved and framed as a cell, it is the harness's first idle cell
  strip for strip at every heading and side; in the shared frame height and
  species read, in the measured one they do not, and the largest figure fits;
  a clip choice cross-fades and then plays the clip alone; every view of one
  moment is one figure at its own size.
- Plausible figures: every draw is a record that builds and places; a seed
  draws one figure; everything a species admits is drawn; a setting is
  likeliest at its middle and seldom at an end; girth leans taper, height
  leans limbs and head, and height and girth do not move together; hair and
  markings follow the covering's lightness and the tunic leans away from it;
  optional forms are carried at their stated odds, and each species' odds are
  what its forms admit — never for none to carry, always where it cannot go
  without, a real chance only where both are admitted. All from fixed seeds,
  so every statistic is one number.
- Framing: every cell of the grid lies inside its square at every side, and
  every build corner stays within the allowances, to within a hundredth.
- `miri`: the figure crate forbids `unsafe` outright and the harness carries
  none, so the UB oracle has nothing to interpret in either; re-test if either
  ever gains any. `loom` is not applicable to either half — neither holds
  shared mutable state, an atomic, or an ordering pairing — stated so the
  absence is an answer rather than silence (§19.11).

## 8. FG8 — the run's mid-stance dip

What the finished part guarantees:

- **The run's legs take the landing and give it back.** Its body sinks from
  each strike to midstance by `motion::RUN_STANCE_DIP` and rises again to
  toe-off, then follows the flight's parabola. The dip is as deep as the
  flight rises, so the bob is centred on the height the body lands at and
  spans a twentieth of the figure. Its shape is `swell`, a polynomial flat at
  both ends, so the root keys are exact at compile time.
- **The stance meets the flight flat — a recorded decision.** Joined at the
  flight's own slope, the leg would be shortening at the landing's full speed
  as it strikes, and between keys a thirty-second of a cycle apart the
  planted foot sags past the grounding bound: measured, even a fifth of the
  shipped rise fails on the longest-legged build a record describes. Taking
  that join needs leg keys finer than a thirty-second and a measurement grid
  finer still to see between them. The flat join keeps the velocity break at
  each strike and toe-off the flight already had, and adds none.
- **The height is keyed where the legs are.** `RUN_LIFT` is generated at
  `RUN_HIP_LEFT`'s own phases, so between two keys the body and a planted
  foot are interpolated along one line and the foot stays on the floor; keyed
  finer, the height would follow its curve while the legs faceted, and the
  difference sinks the foot.
- **Every leg key is its path solved.** The two-bone solve is one free
  function, `plant::solve`, that the planter and the authoring check both
  call. A test states every shipped path whole — the idle's, the walk's and
  the run's — and holds every key of every leg table to it. Only the run's
  eleven interior stance keys moved; strike, toe-off and the swing are as
  they were.
- **The gait reads the stance over the ground.** A contact window taken in the
  body frame sees a planted foot the stance dip raises through the body, and
  held only the step's ends — on the shipped run it straddled the swing and
  fitted a stride of 84 against the authored 96. `Gait::fitted` and
  `Gait::slide` take the foot at the clip's own height through
  `Legs::standing`, the one definition the planter and grounding read too.
  The walk measures exactly as before; the run's window no longer admits
  swing samples, and its skate is 0.0002.
- **Continuity sees the root height**, so a body that pops is caught like a
  joint that does.
- **Grounding's residue is the key spacing's sag**, not rounding: unrounded
  keys ground within a hundred-thousandth of a unit of the six-place ones.
  The run's is 0.061 on the reference human, 0.067 on the elf and 0.073 on
  the tallest, longest-legged build; `MAX_GROUNDING` is unchanged (§6).
- **The digest is re-pinned** and asserted on the host and on all four Tier-1
  targets.
