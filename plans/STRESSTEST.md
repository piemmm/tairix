# STRESSTEST.md — System stress testing and live kernel monitoring

Status: ST1–ST5 done; ST6 planned
Target: TAIRiX
Primary code areas: `lib/abi`, `kernel/mem`, `kernel/core`, `userland/system/sysinfod`, `lib/procinfo`, `userland/apps/`
Secondary code areas: `lib/rt`, `lib/curses`, `userland/shell/sysinfo`, `kernel/sched`, `docs/src/`

This is the staged build plan for TAIRiX's stress-testing and
system-monitoring tier:

- **`sysmon`** — a fullscreen curses monitor application that marks its own
  memory unswappable and observes every aspect of the kernel's memory:
  physical memory, kernel heap, per-process residency, the reclaimable
  caches, the `ramzip` compressed tier, memory-pressure bands, reserves,
  and per-CPU load — usable while the system is under deliberate stress
  (its primary function) and at idle.
- **`stress`** — a comprehensive load-generation command app in the spirit
  of the established `stress`/`stress-ng` command surface: an unswappable
  controlling process spawning swappable workers that load the CPU, memory,
  disk, I/O, and the kernel caches — separately or combined, with a
  configurable overcommit level, signal/Ctrl-C handling, quiet and
  background modes, a run timeout, and an option to run `sysmon` alongside.
- The **observability plumbing** both need: new capability-gated System
  Information API queries (memory detail, pressure, reclaim ledger,
  `ramzip`, caches, per-CPU load) with matching `info:` / `stats:`
  resource-reference selectors (`info:cpu/...`, `stats:mem/pressure`, …)
  served by `sysinfod` and resolved by `lib/procinfo`.
- The two **kernel mechanisms** neither program can be built without: a
  capability-gated, resource-limited memory-pinning surface (the real API
  behind `plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` §5's "pinned" eligibility class), and a
  fail-closed signal-observation opt-in so the stress controller can catch
  `Interrupt`/`Terminate` and tear its workers down before exiting.

`AGENTS.md` is binding — read it and `PLAN.md` first. Every rule in this
file is binding too. This is a design, invariant, staging, and acceptance
document, not a changelog and not a merge-ready implementation. If this
document conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md` wins. If it conflicts with
the repository's actual state, the implementing agent must surface the
mismatch before implementing a guess.

Related plans: `plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` (the `ramzip` tier this observes and
whose pinned-page class ST2 realises), `plans/SMARTRAM.md` (the pressure
gauge and reclaimable caches this observes), `plans/SPAWN.md` (spawn,
`wait`, the `Signal` set, foreground delivery), `plans/APPS.md` (command-app
packaging, options, help), `plans/CURSES.md` (the TUI stack `sysmon` draws
through), `plans/ALIAS.md` (the `info:`/`stats:` reference grammar),
`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` (capability lifecycle), `plans/SYSLOG.md` (audit
events).

## 0. Starting point (what already exists)

Facts the stages below build on, so no stage re-derives them:

- **The System Information API is live and extensible.**
  `lib/abi/src/sysinfo.rs` defines the frozen-on-release `SYSINFO_QUERIES`
  registry (13 queries today, ids 0–12) with per-query capability + audit
  flags; `userland/system/sysinfod` is the sole dispatcher (decode → spec
  lookup → capability check before state → audit → answer through the
  injected `SysinfoSource` seam). `KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS`
  (`CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`, audited) is deliberately coarse: total/free/
  kernel-heap/user-resident/page-size only. `CPU_TIME_STATS`,
  `LOAD_AVERAGE`, `UPTIME`, and the process lists exist.
- **The `info:`/`stats:` resolver is live.** `lib/resref` owns the closed
  16-namespace registry (`info`, `stats`, `state`, …);
  `lib/procinfo::resolve` maps parsed references onto sysinfo queries and
  serves today: `info:hostname|kernel/version|machine-id|boot-time|
  process/*|mem/physical|mem/page-size|limits/*` and `stats:uptime|
  mem/{used,available,kernel-heap,user-resident}|limits/*`. There is no
  `info:cpu`, no `stats:cpu/*`, no `stats:mem/pressure`, and nothing for
  reclaim, caches, or `ramzip`.
- **The kernel already keeps the numbers; it just does not export them.**
  `kernel/mem::pressure` is the shared five-band gauge with hysteresis and
  per-band transition counters; `tairix_reclaim` is the classified
  ledger (per-class payload/metadata bytes, shrink/teardown/failure
  counters); `kernel/mem::ramzip` accounts caps, stored/logical bytes,
  compression attempts/acceptances/rejections, fault-ins, authentication
  failures, and thrash escalations (`plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` §10); the
  SMARTRAM caches (`CachedFs`, the ARXFS `TransformClusterCache`, the
  `LaunchCache`, the `BlockCache`) are budgeted and counted. All of it is
  internal-only today (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` SMART9 — "no public ABI"), and
  `plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` §16 already rules that a public query belongs in
  the System Information API with full ABI discipline. One caveat carries
  through this whole plan: enabling `ramzip` for arbitrary *running* tasks
  awaits the restartable-user-page-fault prerequisite staged in `PLAN.md`
  (every port's user fault hook is terminal today) — the queries report
  whatever the tier really does, and the assertions that stress makes its
  counters *move* bind only once that prerequisite has landed.
- **Signals exist; catching them does not.** `tairix_abi::Signal` is the
  closed set `Continue`/`Terminate`/`Kill`/`Interrupt`/`Stop`
  (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP9, landed): the console line discipline delivers
  `^C`/`^Z` to the marked foreground child, `wait` reports stops, elsh has
  `jobs`/`fg`/`bg`, and the `signal` syscall lets a parent signal its own
  live children (unprivileged for one's own child, audited per call).
  Every terminating signal's disposition is fixed: `Interrupt` terminates
  with status 130. No process can observe or handle a signal today.
- **Pinning is a named hole.** `plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` §5 makes "pinned"
  pages ineligible for `ramzip` and names the marker "a future approved
  API"; no `mem_pin`/`mlock`-equivalent syscall, capability, or resource
  limit exists anywhere in the tree yet.
- **The TUI template is `top`.** `userland/apps/top` is the model: a full
  command-app bundle (AppInfo, `Help/` locales, a `Run` binary linked with
  the shared `lib/rt/Run.ld`) drawing through
  `lib/curses` with an I/O-free `model` + `app` split, event-driven loop,
  alternate screen, and capability refusals rendered as refusals while the
  session continues (fail closed, degrade gracefully).
- **Timed waiting exists.** `waitset_wait` takes a relative nanosecond
  timeout (`u64::MAX` = none) over owner-checked members; `clock_get`
  provides the monotonic clock. Nothing needs to spin to wait
  (`AGENTS.md` §2.23).
- **Resource limits exist.** `rlimit_get`/`rlimit_set` and the `ulimit`
  builtin implement the §24.3 facility with typed `LimitKind`s,
  soft/hard bounds, and the capability gate on raising a hard bound.

---

## 1. Goal

Make TAIRiX's behaviour under load *observable* and *provokable* with
first-party tools: an operator (or CI vertical) starts `stress` to drive
the machine into any chosen combination of CPU, memory, disk, I/O, and
cache pressure, watches the kernel respond in `sysmon` — pressure bands
moving, caches shrinking, `ramzip` filling, reserves holding — and gets
both programs back cleanly on Ctrl-C, a signal, or the timeout. Both
programs survive the very pressure they are built for: their controlling
state is pinned so the monitor never stalls on its own page-fault-in and
the stress controller can always tear its workers down.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Not a benchmark suite.** `stress` loads the system; it does not score
  it. Scored micro-benchmarks stay in the per-crate benches (§7).
- **No network stress.** The userland network stack is a single ICMP
  responder today; network load generation is staged with the future
  network work, not invented here.
- **No thermal/battery/frequency observation.** No such kernel signals
  exist; fabricating them is speculative surface (§2.3/§2.4).
- **No `/proc`, no text-scrape files, no new ad-hoc syscall diagnostics**
  (§16.6 — the System Information API is the only window).
- **No GUI panels.** `sysmon` is a text app; a graphical monitor is a
  future desktop app over the same queries.
- **No per-region pinning ABI.** ST2 pins a whole process's anonymous
  memory; a byte-range `mlock` analogue waits for a real consumer
  (§2.3/§2.4).

---

## 3. Design — observability (ST1)

### 3.1 New sysinfo queries

Four new typed queries join `SYSINFO_QUERIES`, all under the **existing**
`CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` (they expose kernel-wide operational statistics — the
same security boundary `KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS` already guards; §5.2 forbids a
new capability where an existing one expresses the authority), all audited
like their sibling:

- **`MEMORY_PRESSURE`** — the live pressure band (the shared
  `kernel/mem::pressure` five-band gauge), the band thresholds actually in
  force (derived values, reported not promised), the reserve floor, free
  frames, and the per-band transition counters since boot.
- **`RECLAIM_STATS`** — the `tairix_reclaim` ledger paged per class:
  class id, payload bytes, metadata bytes, entry count, shrink/teardown
  counters, refusal counters, and the self-reported share of the
  resident total.
- **`CACHE_LEDGERS`** — the same ledger paged per *cache*: the row
  behind each class total, carrying the cache's label, owner, class,
  reporting pid, and whether the figures were measured by the kernel or
  reported by the process holding them. The SMARTRAM caches (filesystem,
  transform, launch, block) are kernel rows; a desktop process's glyph
  atlases and decoded artwork are reported rows, because nothing outside
  that process can measure its heap. Both fold into the class totals
  above through one shared fold, so the two views can never disagree.
- **`RAMZIP_STATS`** — the SWAPSWAPSWAP §10 accounting dimensions: stored
  encrypted bytes, logical bytes represented, metadata bytes, min/soft/hard
  cap usage, compression attempts/acceptances/rejections, fault-ins,
  authentication failures, decompression failures, warm-up counters,
  thrash escalations, and per-boot pinned-exemption counts (ST2). Never
  page contents, never key material — counters only
  (`plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` §16).
- **`CPU_LOAD`** — per-CPU figures paged per CPU: cpu id, busy/idle
  cumulative time (`Duration64`), the run-queue depth sample, and the
  context-switch and preemption counters the scheduler already keeps.
  The implementing agent first reconciles against `CPU_TIME_STATS`: if
  that query already carries a needed figure, `CPU_LOAD` carries only the
  remainder — the same number is never served twice (§2.2).

Rules carried over unchanged: typed request/response with `WIRE_LEN`
encode/decode and fail-closed `from_bytes` (reserved fields must be zero),
whole-record paging like `MOUNT_LIST`/`SEAT_LIST`, `Time64`/`Duration64`
for every time, `u64` for every byte count (§21, §26.6), fuzz targets for
every new decoder (§19.6), and the `sysinfod` dispatcher changes nothing
structurally — new rows in the registry, new arms in the `SysinfoSource`
seam.

### 3.2 New `info:` / `stats:` selectors

`lib/procinfo::resolve` gains, over the new queries (namespaces are the
existing closed `info`/`stats` set — nothing widens `lib/resref`):

- `info:cpu/count` — the number of online CPUs (gated like
  `info:mem/physical`, a kernel-tier fact).
- `stats:cpu/load` — the all-CPU busy share over the sampling window the
  resolver computes from two `CPU_LOAD` reads; `stats:cpu/<n>/load` the
  per-CPU form. `stats:cpu/switches` — cumulative context switches.
- `stats:mem/pressure` — the current band as a small integer gauge with
  the band name in the envelope; `stats:mem/pressure/transitions` — the
  transition counter.
- `stats:mem/reclaim/total`, `stats:mem/reclaim/<class>` — reclaimable
  bytes held, total and per class (class names are the reclaim ledger's
  own stable names).
- `stats:mem/ramzip/{stored,logical,saved}` — stored encrypted bytes,
  logical bytes represented, and their difference.
- `stats:mem/pinned` — pinned bytes system-wide (ST2).

Unknown leaves keep failing closed (`UnknownSelector`); capability denials
keep mapping to `CapabilityDenied`; decorations stay unserviceable. The
`sysinfo` CLI (`userland/shell/sysinfo`) gains matching subcommands so the
terminal surface and the resolver stay one vocabulary. The `state:`
namespace remains owned by `plans/ALIAS.md`'s own staging and is not
colonised here.

---

## 4. Design — memory pinning (ST2)

The "marks itself as unswappable" requirement, and the real API behind the
`ramzip` eligibility class that already treats pinned pages as ineligible
(`plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` §5).

- **Surface.** Two new syscalls, `mem_pin` / `mem_unpin`, taking no
  arguments beyond the implicit kernel-attested caller: they mark/unmark
  the **calling process's entire anonymous memory** — current and future —
  as pinned. Pinned pages are ineligible for the `ramzip` tier and any
  future lower swap tier; the flag is process-scoped state in `kernel/mem`
  consulted by the one eligibility classifier (never a second check).
  Pinning is not inherited across `spawn` (a stress worker starts
  unpinned) and is cleared on exit.
- **Capability.** New `CAP_MEM_PIN`, introduced in the same change as its
  enforcement point (the syscall dispatcher gate) and its live holders
  (`sysmon` and `stress` manifests) — §5.2's three-part test holds: it
  guards a class of operations (exempting memory from reclaim/compression
  system-wide is a denial-of-service lever against every other tenant),
  it lands with holder and enforcement together, and no existing
  capability expresses "may exempt memory from pressure management".
  Both syscalls are audited (a pin is a security-relevant resource
  decision, §19.4).
- **Bounded.** A new `LimitKind::PinnedMemory` joins the §24.3 resource
  limits: the effective limit caps the bytes a process may hold pinned;
  crossing it fails the *allocation or pin* closed with a typed error,
  never a panic. Default policy is a function of discovered RAM (§24.1),
  sized so a monitor-scale process always fits and an abusive pin cannot
  starve the machine; limits intersect across spawn as ever.
- **Fail-closed, degrade-gracefully consumers.** A refused pin
  (capability or limit) is an *answer*: `sysmon` and the `stress`
  controller report the refusal on their UI/stderr and continue unpinned
  (§2.24) — pinning is incidental to their purpose, not fatal.
- **What pinning is not.** It does not lock pages against being paged in
  lazily, does not change zero-on-free or encryption guarantees, does not
  make the process unkillable, and grants no residency promise beyond
  "never enters a swap tier". `stats:mem/pinned` and `RAMZIP_STATS`
  expose the aggregate so an operator can see pinning pressure.

---

## 5. Design — signal observation (ST3)

The stress controller must catch `^C` (`Signal::Interrupt`) and
`Terminate`, tear its workers down, restore the terminal line, and exit
130/143 — today those signals terminate it before it can act.

- **Surface.** One new syscall, `signal_intake`, by which a process opts
  its **own** termination-request signals (`Interrupt` and `Terminate`
  only) out of default-terminate and into delivery as an observable
  event. No handler trampoline, no asynchronous user-mode re-entry (that
  machinery has no other consumer and huge attack surface): the pending
  signal becomes a waitable **signal source** the process adds to a
  waitset (`waitset_ctl` gains the `Signal` source kind beside
  `Endpoint`/`Irq`) or drains explicitly — the event-driven shape every
  other waiter already has (§2.23).
- **What is never observable.** `Kill` remains unconditionally fatal and
  unmaskable. `Stop`/`Continue` remain scheduler-side. A process that has
  opted in and then never drains its intake does not become immortal:
  a second `Interrupt` arriving while one is already pending undelivered
  escalates to the default terminate path — an unresponsive program stays
  killable with plain `^C ^C`, no new capability, no privileged override
  needed.
- **Scope.** Own-process disposition needs no capability (the same tier
  as `stream_input_mode`); the opt-in and each observed delivery are
  audited like `signal` itself. `lib/rt` gains the safe wrappers; the
  C ABI stubs follow automatically from the generated table.
- The elsh side needs no change: the console line discipline and
  foreground marking (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP9) already deliver the signal;
  only the *target's disposition* changes.

---

## 6. Design — `sysmon` (ST4)

A system app-store command app (`userland/apps/sysmon`), packaged and
built exactly like `top` (full self-contained bundle, `Help/` tree,
model/app split over `lib/curses`, alternate screen so the shell's screen
is restored on exit).

- **Startup.** Parses options, pins itself (`mem_pin`; a refusal is
  rendered, not fatal), enters the alternate screen, and starts the
  event-driven loop: one waitset over stdin input and the refresh
  deadline (`waitset_wait` with the interval timeout — never a poll
  loop).
- **Panels** (all figures from the sysinfo queries, never a private
  kernel channel):
  - *Memory overview* — total/free/kernel-heap/user-resident
    (`KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS`), pinned bytes, page size.
  - *Pressure* — the current band, rendered as name + gauge, with a
    scrolling band history strip and the transition counters
    (`MEMORY_PRESSURE`).
  - *Reclaimable caches* — the per-class ledger table with payload/
    metadata bytes, shrink/refusal counters, and the self-reported share
    of each class (`RECLAIM_STATS`), above the per-cache breakdown that
    says which caches hold it and which of them are reporting their own
    figures (`CACHE_LEDGERS`).
  - *Compressed tier* — `ramzip` stored/logical/saved bytes, cap usage
    against min/soft/hard, compression/fault-in/thrash counters
    (`RAMZIP_STATS`).
  - *CPU* — per-CPU busy% over the refresh interval, run-queue depth,
    context switches (`CPU_LOAD`), and the 1/5/15 load averages
    (`LOAD_AVERAGE`).
  - *Processes (summary)* — the census by state and the top consumers by
    `%CPU` and by resident bytes (the existing process-list queries; the
    full interactive list remains `top`'s job — no duplication).
- **Keys.** `q` quit, `r` refresh now, `+`/`-` change the refresh
  interval within a bounded range, `p` cycle panel focus/scroll, `?`
  help overlay — the `top` conventions.
- **Degradation.** Each gated query that is refused renders as the
  refusal it is in its panel while the rest of the session continues
  (§5.4, §2.24); at idle the app is quiescent between deadlines (no
  busy redraw). It works identically over serial, the video console,
  or a future WM terminal — fd 0/1/2/3 only (§20).
- **Capabilities requested** (manifest): `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`,
  `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` (all-process summary; optional, degrades to
  own-process), `CAP_MEM_PIN`.

---

## 7. Design — `stress` (ST5)

A system app-store command app (`userland/apps/stress`) following the
established `stress`/`stress-ng` option surface (§16.7 familiarity —
divergences only where TAIRiX genuinely differs, documented in `Help/`).

### 7.1 Process model

One **controller** process (pins itself via `mem_pin`, opts into
`signal_intake`) spawning N **worker** children (unpinned — deliberately
swappable, so memory workers exercise `ramzip`), one per requested load
unit, wired through the existing `spawn` startup-strings block (each
worker is the same binary re-entered in worker mode via argv — no second
executable). The controller's loop is one waitset: child exits (`wait`),
the signal intake, and the timeout deadline. On `Interrupt`/`Terminate`/
timeout it signals every live worker `Terminate` (then `Kill` after a
bounded grace deadline), reaps them all, prints the summary (unless
`--quiet`), and exits with the §16.7-familiar status (0 on clean
completion, 130/143 on signals).

### 7.2 Load subsystems

Each is a worker kind with a bounded, restartable unit of work; a worker
that hits a typed refusal (rlimit, ENOSPC, capability) reports it once on
stderr and exits — the controller counts and reports refusals, never
retry-until-it-works (§2.1):

- **cpu** — tight arithmetic loops (integer/float mix) that never issue a
  syscall: exercises preemption (§17.1 — the conformance suite's
  CPU-bound-task property, now provokable on demand).
- **vm** — allocate/touch/re-touch anonymous memory in a rotating
  pattern sized by `--vm-bytes`, driving allocation, fault, and — once the
  restartable-user-page-fault prerequisite has enabled the tier for
  running tasks (§0) — `ramzip` compress-out and fault-in.
- **io** — stream-write/read/rewrite through the filesystem layer with
  small buffers and frequent `fs_sync`: exercises the write path and the
  block cache.
- **hdd** — large sequential file write/verify/delete cycles sized by
  `--hdd-bytes`: exercises throughput and free-space accounting.
- **cache** — repeated cold directory walks and file re-reads over the
  scratch tree: churns the filesystem/block caches so their ledgers move.

Disk-touching workers write **only** beneath a scratch directory the
invoking user can write: default the app-scoped per-user cache directory
(`Library/stress/` under the invoking user, per §16.5's app-write rule),
overridable with `--temp-path <dir>`; every scratch file is removed on
teardown, including the signal paths.

### 7.3 Options (the closed v1 set)

```
--cpu N          N CPU workers
--vm N           N memory workers        --vm-bytes B   (default sized from discovered RAM)
--io N           N I/O workers
--hdd N          N disk workers          --hdd-bytes B
--cache N        N cache-churn workers
--all N          N workers of every kind
--overcommit P   scale the vm/hdd byte targets to P percent of the
                 discovered resource (RAM for vm, free space for hdd);
                 P may exceed 100 — the workers push into pressure and
                 treat the resulting typed refusals as expected outcomes
--timeout T      stop after T (s/m/h suffixes, e.g. 5m); no default
--monitor        run sysmon in the foreground for the duration; the
                 stress run is reported when the monitor exits
--quiet, -q      suppress the summary and progress lines (errors still
                 reach stderr)
--background     print the controller PID and detach from the terminal
                 discipline so the shell prompt returns (the elsh `&`
                 job form works too; this flag is for scripts) — implies
                 --quiet
--help, --version   per §16.7
```

`--monitor` spawns the installed `sysmon` bundle as a foreground child
with the terminal (never an embedded copy — one monitor implementation,
§2.2); with `--background` it is refused as contradictory (typed usage
error). Everything it can see is what the user's own capabilities allow —
`stress` requests only `CAP_MEM_PIN` beyond the baseline; loading a
machine needs no privilege beyond what the caller's own resource limits
permit, and the limits are the defence (§24.3): `stress` respects them
and reports refusals rather than asking for more.

---

## 8. Staged implementation plan

Each stage lands as a complete, tested, documented, fully-gated change
(fmt, `cargo xtask ci` once, `fuzz --secs 5`, the capped developer soak),
with rustdoc, the mdBook pages, and `PLAN.md` updated in the same change.
No stubs, no `todo!()`, no deferred tests.

### ST1 — Observability queries and selectors — **done**

What now holds (the deliverables of §3, with the reconciliations the
implementation fixed):

- The four queries ship as `SysinfoQueryId` 13–16 (`MEMORY_PRESSURE`,
  `RECLAIM_STATS`, `RAMZIP_STATS`, `CPU_LOAD`), all under the existing
  `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`, audited, with `IntrospectDomain` 10–13, typed
  `WIRE_LEN` payloads, fail-closed decoders, unit tests, and
  `fuzz_decode` arms. `RECLAIM_CLASS_NAMES` /
  `reclaim_class_from_name` in `lib/abi` are the one class vocabulary
  the kernel encoder and the resolver share; `PRESSURE_BAND_NAMES` is
  the band vocabulary.
- `CACHE_LEDGERS` sits beside `RECLAIM_STATS` under the same capability
  and the same audit, and `IntrospectDomain::CacheLedgers` is what the
  kernel now exports — per cache, since the per-class fold belongs in
  the one place that also holds the reported rows. The self-reported
  half of that fold is `plans/SMARTRAM.md` SMART9.
- Reconciliation against `CPU_TIME_STATS` (§3.1): `CpuLoadRecord`
  carries only the remainder — run-queue depth sample, context-switch
  and preemption counters; the busy/idle split stays in
  `CPU_TIME_STATS`. The scheduler did **not** yet keep per-CPU
  switch/depth figures, so `SchedulerPolicy` gained the read-only
  `cpu_switches(cpu)` (counted on the same dispatch bracket as
  `cpu_busy_ticks`) and `queue_depth(cpu)` observations, implemented by
  both policies and pinned by the shared conformance suite
  (`load_observations_track_dispatch`).
- `ReclaimClassRecord` carries exactly this plan's field list (class,
  payload/metadata bytes, entries, refusal/shrink/teardown/failure
  counters). `tairix_reclaim::CacheAccounting` was made
  interior-atomic and class-attributed for those figures (entries as a
  live per-class gauge; refusals/shrinks/teardowns/failures per class,
  whole-cache accessors now sum), so a shared `Arc<CacheAccounting>` is
  readable lock-free by the export while the owning cache mutates it
  (single-writer discipline, documented).
- The export rendezvous is `kernel/core::memstats::MEM_STATS`: the boot
  path fetches the **one** system pressure gauge from it
  (`system_pressure`, install-or-get — the aarch64 root-unlock no longer
  leaks its own), every production cache (volume `CachedFs`, block,
  transform, launch) registers its ledger at construction, and a future
  live `ramzip` tier installs its stats feed there. Until that tier is
  driven (the §0 restartable-user-fault caveat), `RAMZIP_STATS`
  truthfully reports an idle tier — zeros, never `NotImplemented`.
- The §3.2 selectors resolve in `lib/procinfo`: `info:cpu/count`,
  `stats:cpu/switches`, `stats:mem/pressure` (band depth gauge with the
  band name carried in the metric name),
  `stats:mem/pressure/transitions`, `stats:mem/reclaim/{total,<class>}`,
  `stats:mem/ramzip/{stored,logical,saved}`. **Reconciliation:**
  `stats:cpu/load` and `stats:cpu/<n>/load` report the cumulative busy
  share since boot (`Unit::Percent`, from the ungated `CPU_TIME_STATS`
  accounting) — a one-shot resolver has no caller-controlled sampling
  window to honestly measure, so the windowed view is `sysmon`'s ST4
  job (two timed reads over its own refresh interval). Unknown leaves
  and unknown class/CPU names fail closed; denials map to
  `CapabilityDenied`; `fuzz_resinfo` covers the new selectors and
  broker replies. `stats:mem/pinned` remains ST2's.
- The `sysinfo` CLI gained `pressure`, `reclaim`, `ramzip`, and `cpu`
  subcommands (fail-closed parsing, aligned renders, Help documents
  updated in all 13 locales); docs pages
  (`abi/sysinfo.md`, `userland/sysinfod.md`, `userland/utilities.md`,
  `lib/resref.md`, `architecture/memory.md` §7k,
  `architecture/scheduler.md`) describe the new surface.
- Tests land per §10's observability rows: round-trips + malformed
  rejection per type, dispatcher denial/audit/paging against the
  fixture source, resolver selector tests, `memstats` host tests that
  the aggregated figures move when a registered ledger moves, and the
  conformance rows for the scheduler observations.

### ST2 — Memory pinning — **done**

What now holds (the deliverables of §4, with the reconciliations the
implementation fixed):

- `mem_pin` (92, `CAP_MEM_PIN` = id 34, audited) and `mem_unpin` (93,
  ungated — releasing one's own exemption grants nothing, the `mem_unmap`
  posture — but audited so the trail carries both pin edges) ship in the
  abi table with dispatcher-enforced gate/audit, `lib/rt` wrappers,
  `tairix_sys_*` stubs, and regenerated C headers. Both are idempotent:
  already in the requested state is success.
- **Reconciliation — the pin state's home.** The plan said "process-scoped
  state in `kernel/mem`"; `kernel/mem` has no task vocabulary, so the mark
  lives in the per-task `AddressSpaceRegistry` (kernel/core) beside every
  other per-task memory fact — `is_pinned` is the one pin decision, the
  declared source of the classifier's `PageCandidate::pinned` attribute
  when the tier's candidate walk lands, and `withdraw` clears it on exit
  (never inherited: a fresh task id is never in the set).
- **Reconciliation — naming and measure.** The limit is
  `LimitKind::PinnedMemoryBytes` ("pinned-memory-bytes", sibling-consistent
  with `stack-bytes`), enforced over the pinned footprint = mapped address
  space + committed stack — the same single accounting the
  `AddressSpaceBytes` ceiling reads (file maps counted: that only tightens
  the cap). Enforced at `mem_pin` (over-budget refused `OutOfRange`,
  nothing stored) and, while pinned, at the shared `check_map_growth`
  (`mem_map` + `file_map`) and the stack-growth resolver.
- The discovered-RAM default is `default_pinned_limit_bytes` (installed
  RAM / 8, soft = hard) installed at boot as the registry-held per-boot
  default limit set (`set_default_limits`; `LimitSet::inherit` now
  intersects against it), so every task inherits it, `ulimit`/`rlimit_get`
  report it, and raising past it takes `CAP_RLIMIT_RAISE`. An unknown
  installed total keeps the compile-time floor. `CAP_MEM_PIN` joined the
  administrative ceiling (`tairix_users::ADMINISTRATIVE_SET`), the intended
  grant path for the ST4/ST5 tool manifests.
- **Reconciliation — the aggregate's carrier.** `RamzipStats.reserved`
  became `pinned_bytes` (reserved-field evolution, wire length unchanged):
  the live system-wide pinned footprint the introspect export composes
  from the registry — observable whether or not a tier runs — resolved by
  `stats:mem/pinned` and rendered by `sysinfo ramzip`; the per-task
  `RESOURCE_LIMITS` usage reports the footprint while pinned, zero
  otherwise.
- Tests land per §10's pinning rows: registry/handler host tests (pin
  idempotence + withdraw, over-budget pin refused and nothing stored,
  growth-while-pinned bounded before the producer, stack growth bounded by
  the remaining budget, aggregate walks only pinned tasks), dispatcher
  gate/audit table tests, resolver + CLI fixtures, and the
  `mem_pin_qemu_aarch64` vertical — the production `KernelDispatchHook` on
  real traps driving `deny` (refused `PermissionDenied`, ungated unpin
  still succeeds), `pin` (the full bound/pin/map/unpin dance), and `child`
  (spawned by the pinned parent, its over-budget map succeeds: the mark is
  never inherited even though the limit is). "Pinned pages never selected
  under simulated pressure" binds through the classifier's existing
  `Ineligible::Pinned` refusal tests plus the registry-sourced attribute;
  the tier-driving pressure assertion stays with the §0
  restartable-user-fault prerequisite.

### ST3 — Signal observation — **done**

What now holds (the deliverables of §5, with the reconciliations the
implementation fixed):

- `signal_intake` (94, ungated — own-process disposition, the
  `stream_input_mode` tier — and audited per call) ships in the abi table
  with a closed op argument, `SignalIntakeOp` (`Enable` = 0, `Disable` =
  1, `Take` = 2), and the value-or-negative-errno `U64` return (`Take`
  yields the drained signal's wire discriminant). `lib/rt::signal_intake`
  and the `tairix_sys_signal_intake` stub follow; the C header additionally
  gained `TAIRIX_SIGNAL_INTAKE_OP_*` **and** the previously-unemitted
  `TAIRIX_WAITSET_OP_*` / `TAIRIX_WAIT_SOURCE_*` vocabulary (a `waitset_ctl`
  caller had no symbolic constants — a pre-existing C-surface gap fixed
  in the same change).
- The intake state is a per-task entry in `kernel/core::procsignal`
  (present = opted in; value = the **one** pending observed signal).
  `KernelProcessSignal` intercepts `Interrupt`/`Terminate` in both
  delivery paths (a parent's `signal`, the console line discipline's
  foreground `deliver`) before `terminate()`: a free slot records the
  signal and wakes the target; `Kill` is never offered.
  **Reconciliation — the escalation is any second termination request**,
  not only a second `Interrupt`: an occupied slot declines the intercept
  and the default terminate runs, which is strictly stronger killability
  than the plan's minimum (`^C ^C` still kills).
- **Reconciliation — `Disable` with a pending undrained observation
  refuses `WouldBlock`** (drain it and act on it): a recorded termination
  request is never silently discarded. `Take` with nothing pending is
  `WouldBlock` (park on the wait-set, retry); `Take` without the opt-in
  is `NotFound`. Enable/Disable are idempotent; a re-`Enable` never drops
  a pending observation. The opt-in is never inherited across spawn and
  is cleared by the one shared task reclaim on every death path.
- `WaitSourceKind::Signal` (= 6) joins the waitset vocabulary: `id` is
  always 0 (one intake per process, own-process only), the add is
  admitted only for an opted-in caller (oracle-free `NotFound`
  otherwise), readiness is the non-consuming pending peek, and the wake
  is the **targeted** `SIGNAL_INTAKE_WAITQ` (joined only by sets holding
  a `Signal` member; the intake-record path wakes exactly the opted-in
  task).
- Audit: every `signal_intake` call is dispatcher-audited (the opt-in,
  the opt-out, and each observed delivery's drain), and both delivery
  routes into the intake are audited at their source (the sender's
  audited `signal`; the console line discipline acting on the foreground
  owner's standing instruction) — parity with `signal` itself.
- Docs: `docs/src/architecture/syscalls.md` (table row, waitset member,
  the `signal_intake` disposition-model section, handler-table row) —
  TAIRiX deliberately ships no user-mode handler trampoline; observation
  is event-shaped.
- Tests per §10's signal-observation rows: procsignal host tests (intake
  lifecycle, disable-with-pending, escalation decline, opted-in
  `Interrupt` observed not fatal + `Kill` still kills, second-`Interrupt`
  escalation to the 130 reap, foreground path, un-opted tests unchanged),
  waitset add/ready/drain handler tests, dispatcher gate/audit +
  unknown-op tests, fuzz/proptest harness rows, `lib/rt` marshalling
  tests, and the **extended `signal_qemu_aarch64` vertical** (no second
  crate): a third fixture role opts in, a real `ConsoleDevice`
  cooked-mode `^C` is observed and drained, and two further undrained
  `^C`s escalate to the default terminate reaped as 130 under a synthetic
  supervisor.

### ST4 — `sysmon` — **done**

What now holds (the deliverables of §6, with the reconciliations the
implementation fixed):

- The `userland/apps/sysmon` bundle ships complete (AppInfo requesting
  `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE`/`CAP_CONSOLE_READ`/`CAP_FS_ACCESS`/
  `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`/`CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`/`CAP_MEM_PIN`, thirteen
  `Help/` locales pinned by the locale test, README,
  `docs/src/userland/sysmon.md`), registered on the x86_64/riscv64
  embedded boot floor (`SYSMON_PATH`/`SYSMON_MANIFEST`/`SPAWN_PROGRAMS`
  row) and discovered from the store on aarch64 like every sibling.
- **Reconciliation — nothing but the terminal is fatal.** The plan's
  per-panel degradation is total: `Model::refresh` is infallible — every
  query (gated and ungated alike) degrades independently through the
  typed `Gauge` (`Ready`/`Denied`/`Unavailable`), a denied global census
  falls back to the caller's own with a short `(own)` census marker and
  the full stated refusal leading the processes panel (the 80-column
  tasks line cannot carry it), and a service that refuses *everything*
  still leaves a running session of stated refusals. `SysmonError` is
  `Usage`/`Terminal` only.
- The §6 layout/keys hold: six summary lines (title with uptime/load/pin
  state; memory overview — used/total/heap and the overlapping
  ramzip/pinned aggregates in compact `format_size` units; pressure band
  name + depth gauge + free/reserve/entry counters; the band-history
  strip — one glyph per refresh, bounded at 120 samples; aggregate CPU
  busy share over the interval with summed switch/preemption counters;
  task census) above a `p`-cycled scrollable detail panel (reclaim
  ledger table, `ramzip` counter block, per-CPU table joining the
  CPU_TIME split with the CPU_LOAD remainder, top consumers by interval
  `%CPU` and by resident bytes — the full list stays `top`'s). `+`/`-`
  step the interval one second within 0.1–60 s and re-arm the very next
  bounded wait; `r` refreshes now; `?`/`h` overlay; `q` quits.
- 80×25 fit is an invariant, not incidental: the Mem and CPU summary
  lines draw through one adaptive `gauge_line` that sizes the bar from the
  columns the compact `format_size`/`format_count` figures leave — the bar
  shrinks toward a floor and is dropped entirely rather than clip a figure
  — and the Pressure entry counter and CPU switch/preemption counters use
  `format_count`, so every mandatory figure stays on the line at 80
  columns. A grid-reconstruction test (`compose` → cell readback) asserts
  it on the healthy snapshot and on a terabyte/million-counter worst case.
- Pin-on-start with graceful refusal: `mem_pin` before the first
  refresh; `0` → `[pinned]`, `-PermissionDenied` → "CAP_MEM_PIN not
  held", `-OutOfRange` → "pinned-memory limit exceeded" — a standing
  title-line state, never fatal, never silently blank.
- **Reconciliation — the shared hoists §2.2 forced.** sysmon is the
  second consumer of three things that previously lived inline, so each
  moved to its one home in the same change: the four kernel-statistics
  fetches into `tairix_procinfo::kstats` (`memory_pressure`,
  `ramzip_stats`, `for_each_reclaim_class`, `for_each_cpu_load`; the
  `info:`/`stats:` resolver retargeted onto them, its malformed-reply
  error now uniformly `Malformed`), the GNU `-d secs.tenths` grammar
  into `tairix_curses::delay` (`top` delegates), and the viewer figure
  formatters (`format_tenths`/`format_size`/`format_mib`/
  `format_uptime`/`format_load`) into `tairix_procinfo::human` (`top`
  imports them; only `TIME+` stays `top`-private).
- Tests land per §10's sysmon rows: exhaustive host model tests (keys,
  panel cycling + scroll clamp, interval bounds, degradation states,
  census fallback, band-history bound, per-CPU/per-process interval
  deltas, pin-state record), render tests over an in-memory tty (every
  panel's tokens, each refusal spelled out, the pin refusal, the help
  overlay, the refuse-everything survival case), loop tests (quit,
  auto-refresh on the elapsed bounded wait), and the
  `sysmon_qemu_aarch64` full-boot vertical: login → `sysmon` spawned
  from the store bundle → `Pressure:` figures on the transcript → `r`
  refresh → `reclaimable` ledger header → `q` → the shell prompt back on
  the restored screen, PASS keyed on sysmon's audited exit then the
  shell's (the arm-then-exit discipline).

### ST5 — `stress` — **done**

What now holds (the deliverables of §7, with the reconciliations the
implementation fixed):

- The `userland/apps/stress` bundle ships complete (AppInfo requesting
  `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE`/`CAP_FS_ACCESS`/`CAP_PROC_SPAWN`/`CAP_MEM_PIN` —
  no `CAP_CONSOLE_READ`: `^C` arrives through the signal intake, never
  fd 0 — thirteen `Help/` locales, README,
  `docs/src/userland/stress.md`), registered on the x86_64/riscv64
  embedded boot floor (`STRESS_PATH`/`STRESS_MANIFEST`/`SPAWN_PROGRAMS`
  row) and discovered from the store on aarch64 like every sibling.
- **Reconciliation — the `@self` token widened in place.** Workers
  re-enter the same binary via the reserved `SPAWN_SELF` token, which now
  serves **any** spawn of the caller's own binary (previously
  sandbox-only; still attested-path — never `argv[0]` — still the full
  resolution and load gate, still fail-closed for a caller with no
  spawnable path). The worker argv codec lives in `worker.rs`
  (`["stress","--worker",kind,bytes,index,scratch]`, decoded fail-closed).
- **Reconciliation — the secured VFS stamps creations.**
  `MetaPolicy::stamp_creation` rewrites a freshly created node's
  ownership to the creating caller's `(uid, gid)` under the `PerInode`
  policy (mode/ACL/gate untouched, `Uniform` no-op): ARXFS's raw create
  stamped the system user, which locked creators out of their own
  private-mode files — the scratch tree under `$HOME/Library/stress`
  depends on the fix.
- **Reconciliation — orphans strand no zombies, without lying about
  liveness.** The one shared task reclaim gained
  `ProcessWait::parent_exited`: a dead parent's unreaped zombie rows are
  dropped and its running children become orphans (`parent: None`) whose
  rows survive so `is_live` stays honest for the console-foreground
  gate; an orphan's own exit removes its row instead of minting an
  unreapable zombie. `--background` builds on this: the front process
  re-spawns `@self` (options minus `--background`, `--quiet` implied,
  `HOME` threaded), prints the controller PID, and exits — the detached
  run continues as a safe orphan until the login session it was started in
  ends, which ends it (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`).
- The five §7.2 subsystems are bounded, restartable units (`load.rs`)
  over the injected `Scratch` seam; a typed refusal (ENOSPC, a limit, a
  refused allocation) exits `REFUSED_EXIT` (3) and is counted as an
  expected outcome, any other worker failure fails the run exit 1 (GNU
  convention; signals end 130/143). Teardown-phase `Terminate`/`Kill`
  statuses (143/137) count clean — the requested outcome — while the
  same statuses mid-run mean an externally killed worker, reported as a
  failure.
- Sizing (`sizing.rs`) is policy over discovery: vm workers share half
  the `boot_facts` RAM, hdd workers half the scratch volume's free space
  (unprivileged `MOUNT_LIST`, longest-covering-mount match);
  `--overcommit P` rescales to `P`%; explicit bytes win; documented
  fallbacks (32 MiB vm / 16 MiB hdd per worker) when discovery is
  unavailable; u128 intermediates, 64 KiB floor.
- The controller (`ctrl.rs`) is a host-provable state machine
  (`Running → Draining → Killing`) driven off one wait-set
  (`WAITSET_CHILD_ANY` + the `Signal` intake member + the timeout/grace
  deadline as the bounded wait): a completed run's teardown targets
  workers only (`--monitor` reports when the user quits sysmon), signal
  ends tear the monitor down too, the 2 s grace escalates to `Kill`, and
  scratch cleanup (`run_scratch_paths` — exactly the run's own
  deterministic names, never other files in a `--temp-path` directory)
  runs on every exit path. The summary lines are GNU-shaped
  (`report.rs`) and the fd-3 `summary` record is best-effort advisory.
- Tests land per §10's stress rows: exhaustive host tests (parser
  valid/invalid/contradictory, worker-codec round-trip + fail-closed
  shapes, sizing scale/overcommit/fallback/no-wrap, each unit's load and
  refusal/corruption handling over an in-memory scratch, every teardown
  path — Interrupt 130, timeout 0, grace `Kill`, external kill reported,
  all-refused end, monitor policy, no phase regression), kernel host
  tests for the widened `@self` (plain spawn serves, no-path refusal),
  `stamp_creation` (creator-owned file + directory), and
  `parent_exited` (zombie drop, honest orphan liveness, no stranded
  zombie, sibling isolation, stop discard), and the
  `stress_qemu_aarch64` full-boot vertical reproduces the reported metal
  sequence exactly on four CPUs: login → wait one second at the first shell
  prompt → `stress --cpu 10 --timeout 120s --background` → returned prompt
  accepts `sysmon` → `Pressure:` frame renders → raw `r` refresh reaches the
  `reclaimable` panel → `q` restores the shell → `true` runs at the restored
  prompt. The shell is not exited, because a logout ends the login's session
  and the detached run with it. The sink requires both `comm=stress` exits
  (foreground detach launcher plus detached controller) *and* `true`'s exit,
  firing on whichever lands last, so the detached controller's full
  120-second run is still required however it interleaves with the command;
  workers terminate through controller teardown and do not invoke `exit`. No
  step is sequenced after the controller's exit: every scripted marker must be
  a line some process prints and leaves standing, and the controller's exit
  line is a transient one from a concurrent process that can pass the search
  cursor while the monitor dialogue runs (under D73 that dialogue could take
  the whole 120 s). The QEMU matrix retains
  emulator/I/O headroom for one-vCPU guests and admits an SMP TCG guest alone,
  so mutually synchronising guest CPUs cannot be starved by another emulator
  past a wall-clock deadline. Its stdout/stderr drains retry interrupted host
  reads, turn a hard read error or drain panic into an immediate named harness
  failure, and distinguish a serial channel that closes while QEMU remains
  live from a guest timeout; marker-gated login input can never silently stop
  and masquerade as a guest failure. The aarch64
  context switch preserves each suspended continuation's `DAIF` in its
  on-stack native frame; without that state, a blocking syscall could return
  to the dispatcher with IRQs masked and starve the same service-progress
  assertion under SMP. `kthread_switch_qemu_aarch64` pins the lower-level
  invariant with two continuations carrying opposite IRQ-mask states across
  repeated switches. `syscall_resume_qemu_aarch64` pins the higher-level
  completion sequence: a successful ordinary syscall suspends its EL0 parent,
  a second EL0 task parks in a blocking syscall, and the parent resumes with
  its result intact. The CFQ host suite drives the same parent-yield/child-park
  sequence through a cross-CPU steal. Aarch64 publishes each validated dense
  CPU id through `TPIDR_EL1` before IRQ/scheduler use, so sparse firmware MPIDR
  affinities can never index the discovered-sized continuation/preemption
  tables. The shared production-dispatch chassis additionally runs 64 private
  IPC call/reply cycles as a one-vCPU control and a four-vCPU migration proof;
  the latter starts real secondary dispatchers, observes the known caller on
  multiple CPUs, and checks reply, integer/FP, stack, PC, and address-space
  state after every wake. Scheduler park completion also preserves an early
  waker's already-enqueued `Ready` transition. Sleeping disk-lock release now
  hands ownership directly to the oldest FIFO waiter while the lock remains
  closed to barging, so newer bundle reads cannot repeatedly steal the lock
  before the woken driver-store continuation runs. The numeric
  counter-movement rows are the ST1 kernel/host tests;
  `RAMZIP_STATS` movement stays behind the §0 restartable-user-fault
  prerequisite.

### ST6 — Integration, benchmarks, docs sweep

Deliverables: the combined vertical (`stress` under `sysmon` under QEMU:
pressure bands move, the pinned monitor's memory never enters `ramzip`,
both exit clean); benchmark evidence for the pinning default policy and
the query hot paths (paging cost bounded); README support-matrix rows
where per-arch state varies; `docs/src/` pages current; `PLAN.md`
STRESSTEST section moved to done-state summaries.

Stage order is binding: ST4 depends on ST1+ST2; ST5 on ST1–ST4
(for `--monitor`); ST6 on all. The ST5/ST6 assertions that `RAMZIP_STATS`
counters move additionally depend on the restartable-user-page-fault
prerequisite (§0); until it lands those verticals assert the pressure and
reclaim movement only, and the plan is updated when the tier switches on.

---

## 9. Invariants (binding)

- **No second data channel.** Every figure both apps show travels through
  the System Information API; no kernel back-door, no debug syscall, no
  log scraping (§16.6).
- **Counters, never contents.** No query, selector, or panel ever exposes
  page contents, key material, capability tokens, or another user's data
  beyond what its capability gate already licenses (§19.4, §23.1).
- **Fail closed, degrade gracefully.** Every refusal (capability, limit,
  ENOSPC) is a typed answer rendered/reported while the session continues
  where the action was incidental, and a stated fatal reason where it was
  the purpose (§2.24, §5.4).
- **Event-driven always.** Neither app ever spins: refresh, timeout,
  child exit, and signal are all waitset members. The *only* intentional
  tight loops are the stress workers' load units — that is their entire
  purpose, they run only for the requested duration, and they are
  ordinary preemptible user tasks (§2.23's carve-out does not even need
  stretching: generating load is the work, not a wait).
- **Pinning is bounded and observable.** `CAP_MEM_PIN` + the pinned-bytes
  rlimit + the `stats:mem/pinned` gauge land together; an unbounded or
  invisible pin is a defect (§24.3, §24.1).
- **Signals stay honest.** `Kill` is never observable or maskable; an
  opted-in process that stops draining is still terminable; the un-opted
  default is byte-identical to SP9.
- **The apps are ordinary bundles.** Full self-contained `.app` bundles
  discovered from the store, help in `Help/` only, coreutils-style
  options where a counterpart exists (§16.5, §16.7), fd 0/1/2/3 only
  (§20).
- **64-bit everywhere.** Byte counts `u64`, times `Time64`/`Duration64`
  (§21, §26.6).

## 10. Required test matrix summary

```text
observability:
  each new payload round-trips and rejects malformed/reserved bytes
  fuzz targets for every new decoder
  capability denial fails closed and is audited
  counters move when the underlying gauge/ledger moves
  resolver: new selectors resolve, unknown leaves fail closed,
    denial maps to CapabilityDenied, decorations unserviceable

pinning:
  pinned pages never selected for ramzip under pressure
  unpin restores eligibility
  pinned-bytes limit crossing fails closed (typed, no panic)
  CAP_MEM_PIN denial fails closed; audit event emitted
  not inherited across spawn; cleared on exit
  stats:mem/pinned reflects the aggregate

signal observation:
  opted-in Interrupt observed, not fatal; exit 130 after teardown
  Kill unconditionally fatal regardless of opt-in
  second pending Interrupt escalates to terminate
  un-opted process behaviour unchanged from SP9
  console ^C reaches the intake end-to-end (QEMU)

sysmon:
  model: keys, panel focus, refresh interval bounds, degradation states
  gated-query refusal renders as refusal, session continues
  pin refusal continues unpinned with notice
  alternate screen restored on quit (shell screen intact)
  idle: no work between deadlines

stress:
  option parsing: valid, invalid, contradictory (--monitor + --background)
  each worker kind produces its load and honours its byte target
  overcommit >100% yields typed refusals counted, never a crash/spin
  timeout expiry: workers terminated, reaped, scratch removed, exit 0
  ^C / Terminate: same teardown, exit 130/143
  worker killed externally: controller reports and continues teardown
  --quiet silences stdout summary, never stderr errors
  --background returns the prompt; controller keeps running
  scratch hygiene on every exit path

integration:
  stress under sysmon: pressure band moves, ramzip counters move,
    pinned monitor memory never compressed, both exit clean
```

---

## 11. Acceptance checklist

This work is complete only when all items are true:

- `AGENTS.md` read and obeyed; this plan and `PLAN.md` kept current in
  the same changes (§13).
- Rust-only; no C/C++/new assembly; generated headers regenerated where
  the ABI changed and drift gates green (§9).
- Every new query/syscall/capability/limit landed with a live caller,
  its enforcement point, docs, fuzz coverage, and audit events in the
  same change (§5.2, §16.6, §19.6).
- No new capability beyond `CAP_MEM_PIN`; no widening of `lib/resref`'s
  namespace registry.
- Both apps are complete self-contained bundles with `Help/` trees; no
  embedded help, no compiled-in app lists (§16.5).
- All §9 invariants hold; all §10 matrix rows have passing tests; no
  production `unwrap()`/`expect()`/`panic!()`/`todo!()`, no ignored
  tests, no retry loops.
- The whole-project gate has been run in the foreground to completion
  for every stage: `cargo fmt --all` (+ `--check`), `cargo xtask ci`
  exactly once, `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5`, and the developer-capped
  soak (`tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20`); actual output quoted in the
  completion report with the §23.5 verdict.

## 12. Prompt for an implementation agent

```text
You are implementing the next approved stage of `plans/STRESSTEST.md` for
TAIRiX.

Before coding, read `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `plans/STRESSTEST.md`,
`plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md`, `plans/SMARTRAM.md`, `plans/SPAWN.md`,
`plans/APPS.md`, `plans/CURSES.md`, `plans/ALIAS.md`,
`lib/abi/src/sysinfo.rs`, `lib/procinfo`, `userland/system/sysinfod`,
`userland/apps/top`, `kernel/mem` (pressure, reclaim, ramzip), and the
signal/wait/waitset/rlimit syscall surface.

State the assumptions you verified from the repository: the current
sysinfo query set and dispatcher seam, the pressure/reclaim/ramzip
counter locations, the Signal set and delivery paths, the waitset
timeout semantics, the rlimit LimitKind set, and the command-app bundle
conventions. Where this plan and the tree disagree, surface the mismatch
and stop.

Implement only the approved stage, completely: ABI + kernel + userland +
rustdoc + mdBook + unit/fuzz/property tests + QEMU verticals where
staged, with no stubs, no deferred tests, no speculative surface, and no
security defence weakened. Counters only — never page contents or
secrets. Fail closed; degrade gracefully where the plan says an action
is incidental.

Finish by running the full workspace gate in the foreground and waiting
for it to exit: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo fmt --all --check`,
`cargo xtask ci` (exactly once), `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5`, and
`tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20` on a developer machine. Quote actual
command output and state the AGENTS.md §23.5 verdict.
```
