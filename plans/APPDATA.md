# APPDATA.md — Per-app settings, secrets, blobs and temporary files, gated by attested app identity

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. Read `AGENTS.md` and `PLAN.md` first; every rule in
both applies here without exception.

This plan replaces the current "every app invents its own file under
`Settings/`" arrangement with **one** OS-provided app-data service: a per-app
private configuration store keyed on the app's signed bundle identifier, an
opt-in public scope, a sealed secret scope, a descriptor-backed blob store for
bulk data, and per-app temporary files — all reachable only through an API
that gates on the **kernel-attested identity of the calling app**, not on
anything the caller says about itself.

It exists as a plan because it adds a new `lib/abi` service ABI, a new system
service, a new capability, a signed-manifest field, and an amendment to the
authoritative filesystem layout — each of which `AGENTS.md` §3/§5.2/§9/§16.4
requires be proposed and approved in a plan file **before** any of it is built.

## 1. The defect

### 1.1 There is no isolation between apps' settings

Every app today writes a file of its own choosing under the launching user's
home, under its own authority, with `CAP_FS_ACCESS`:

| Consumer | Path it invented | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `userland/apps/terminal` | `<home>/Settings/Terminal/terminal.conf` | **migrated** (AD5) — private scope |
| `userland/apps/fstree` | `<home>/Settings/fstree/config` (`settings.rs`) | **migrated** (AD10) — private scope |
| `userland/gui/session` (writes) / `userland/apps/wallpaper` (reads) | `<home>/Settings/Pinboard/pinboard.conf` — **two programs, one hand-rolled path** (§1.5) | **migrated** (AD10) — the session's published scope |
| `userland/apps/applib` (writes) / `userland/gui/session` (reads) | `<home>/Settings/ProgramLibrary/library.conf` | **migrated** (AD10) — `applib`'s published scope |
| `userland/system/init` | `<home>/Settings/Services/` | **out of scope, and structurally so.** It is the account's service *enrolment* (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md`), read by PID 1: a boot-floor program the kernel launches from the embedded registry, which carries no signed manifest and therefore has no attested app identity to key a store on (§3.2). It is also read before `confd` can be running. A store it could not reach with an identity it does not have would be a fabrication, so the path stays — under the user's own authority, as system configuration rather than app data. |

Every path in that column is **deleted**, not dual-read (§2). What remains
under a user's `Settings/` is the gated `Apps/` root and nothing an
application wrote itself.

Because the whole tree is owned by the user and every app runs as that user
with `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, **any** app the user launches can read and rewrite
**every** other app's settings. A malicious or merely buggy app can read the
terminal's profile, rewrite the service enrolment store, or corrupt the
pinboard. The filesystem permission model (§5.3) cannot fix this: it keys on
uid, and all of a user's apps share one uid. **App-from-app isolation within a
single user is not expressible with per-inode owner/mode/ACL at all** — which
is precisely why a gating service is required rather than a tighter mode bit.

### 1.2 The naming is ad-hoc and collides

The directory component is whatever the app picked — `Terminal`, `fstree`,
`Pinboard`, `ProgramLibrary` — inconsistently cased, unnamespaced, and
first-come-first-served. Two independent developers who both ship a `Notes`
app collide. The charter's own spelling (§16.5, "copied into the user's
`/Users/<u>/Settings/<Name>/`") keys on the bundle's display *name*, which is
neither unique nor stable.

Meanwhile the signed manifest **already** carries a globally unique,
developer-namespaced identifier — `id = "os.tairix.terminal"`,
`AppInfoHeader::id` (`lib/abi/src/appinfo.rs:658`) — and nothing uses it to
key storage.

### 1.3 The format engine is copied per app

Three separate hand-rolled `key=value` parsers exist (`lib/sysconfig`,
`userland/apps/fstree/src/settings.rs`, `lib/wallpaper`), each with its own
tolerance rules, its own bounds, and its own idea of what a malformed line
means. §2.2 (define shared data once) and §2.3 forbid the fourth copy.

None of them preserves comments or unrecognised lines on rewrite, so an app
that saves its settings silently destroys whatever the user hand-edited in.

**Closed (AD3, AD10).** `lib/appconf` is the one engine. `fstree`'s and
`lib/wallpaper`'s are **deleted**, and `lib/proglib`'s — a fourth the survey
missed, because its document is a *catalog* rather than a settings sheet —
went with them once its overlay had to live in the store (§3.17). Each of
those crates now defines a closed **registry** over the one format and no
grammar, comment rule, or length bound of its own. `lib/sysconfig` keeps its
own, deliberately and for the reason §3.3 records.

### 1.4 There is no attested app identity to gate on

The kernel-attested `Origin` (`lib/abi/src/origin.rs:262`) carries
`trust_domain, uid, gid, pid, proc_id, capabilities, console` — **no app
identity**. A service receiving a request over IPC can attest *which user* and
*which process instance* is calling, but not *which application*. So no
service can implement "only `os.tairix.terminal` may touch
`os.tairix.terminal`'s settings" today, however it is written.

The information exists and is already verified: the kernel runs the signed
load gate at spawn (`kernel/core/src/appspawn.rs`, `lib/appload`), which
checks the Ed25519 manifest signature and the bundle content hash, and it
already retains other attested facts about the admitted program on the
process's capability record (`spawn_path`, `credential`, `name` —
`kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs:10202`). The verified bundle identity is simply
dropped on the floor instead of being retained beside them.

### 1.5 Isolation with no sanctioned sharing channel re-creates §1.1

Two of a user's applications sometimes have to agree on a value — a terminal's
font and an app that embeds one, a chooser and the surface it configures. The
tree already has one: the desktop session owns and writes
`~/Settings/Pinboard/pinboard.conf`, and the settings surface that edited
it — a separate bundle — opened that path directly under `CAP_FS_ACCESS` to
show the user what is currently applied. (Its *write* already goes through the session's own endpoint,
so only the read is unmediated — which is exactly the half a published scope
replaces.)

A store that *only* isolates therefore does not remove §1.1; it relocates it.
An application that must publish a value to another would be left with the one
route it already has — an invented path written under `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, readable
and writable by every other app of that user — which is precisely the
arrangement this plan exists to delete. Isolation is only complete when the
store also provides the sanctioned channel, so that "reach another app's data"
has exactly one shape, that shape is opt-in by the *publishing* app, and it
cannot be widened into the private scope.

**Closed (AD6 built it, AD10 consumed it.)** Both in-tree instances of the
defect are gone: the Settings application reads the session's *published*
pinboard document, and the desktop session reads `applib`'s *published*
library overlay. Neither reader can write what it reads, and neither can name
the publisher's private scope, because a foreign read is a request shape with
no scope field.

### 1.6 There is nowhere to put secrets, bulk data, or temporary files

- **Secrets.** An email client has nowhere to keep a password. `lib/crypto`
  has the primitives (ChaCha20-Poly1305 `seal`/`open`, PBKDF2, and
  `derive_key` — single-block HKDF-Expand, RFC 5869) and ARXFS has a per-volume
  key hierarchy, but there is no per-app, per-user sealed store — **closed
  (AD7)**.
- **Bulk data.** A config file is the wrong shape for a mail index or a
  thumbnail cache, and the IPC payload ceiling is 1 MiB
  (`IPC_MESSAGE_MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN`), so no store that proxies bytes through
  messages can serve large data at all, let alone with random access —
  **closed (AD8)**.
- **Temporary files.** There is no `/tmp` and the OS never creates one (§16.1,
  correctly). Apps therefore have no sanctioned scratch space, so scratch
  files land in the user's real directories with no isolation and no reaping —
  **closed (AD9)**, and still with no `/tmp`.

---

## 2. Scope and decisions (binding for this plan)

- **Isolation is enforced by a service, not by file modes.** Per-inode
  owner/mode/ACL keys on uid and cannot separate two apps of the same user
  (§1.1). One system service (`confd`) owns the store tree and is the only
  principal that can reach it; every app reaches its own data only through
  the service's ABI. This is the justification for the service existing at
  all — it is not a convenience wrapper over the VFS.
- **The store is keyed on the signed bundle id, never on a display name.**
  `os.tairix.terminal`, `org.pty.widgets`. The id comes from the
  kernel-attested manifest, so it is unforgeable and unique; the display name
  is neither.
- **An app never names its own store.** The daemon derives it from the attested
  `Origin`. A request carries a bundle id **only** to name a *foreign* app's
  published scope, and that request is a **distinct operation with no scope
  field** — so a frame that names another app cannot ask for its private
  document at all. There is no request shape by which an app can claim to be
  another app.
- **The sealed scope is not a configuration scope, and its writes are not
  staged.** Secrets are reached by operations carrying no scope field and with
  no foreign counterpart, so "a configuration frame naming a secret" and "any
  frame naming another app's secrets" are unrepresentable rather than refused.
  A sealed write is applied before the reply — no staging, no commit — which
  keeps plaintext in the daemon for one request instead of a session's lifetime
  *and* makes the read-modify-seal-publish atomic, because the daemon serves one
  request at a time. A stage-then-commit pair would let two instances of one app
  lose each other's secrets. See §3.6, §3.7.
- **A vault that cannot be opened is never an empty vault.** A damaged record, a
  failed authentication, and absent key material are each a distinct audited
  refusal. An application deciding whether to prompt for a password must be able
  to tell "damaged" from "none saved"; conflating them is how a store silently
  loses a user's secrets.
- **The published scope is one document, with no layer beneath it.** Not a
  simplification: `confd` cannot name a bundle's own directory (§3.4), so a
  bundle-shipped published document could never be read on the foreign path, and
  a layer that worked only for the publishing app would mean two apps
  disagreeing about what a third publishes. A machine-wide layer is excluded for
  a second reason — a reader must be able to attribute a published value to the
  *application*, and an administrator must not be able to make an app appear to
  say something it never said. Layering is the private scope's alone.
- **A foreign read is never an oracle.** An app that publishes nothing, one that
  has never run for the account, and one whose store cannot be attested all
  answer the same empty document, audited. Only the caller's *own* refusals — no
  home, a root the service does not own, an unreachable volume — are reported as
  themselves, because only those are worth a retry. So a reader learns what an
  app chose to publish and nothing else.
- **Ownership is pinned to the developer, not to the build key.** The stable
  developer identity is a **publisher key** declared in the signed manifest; a
  per-build **signing key** is certified by it. An app update signed with a new
  signing key keeps its settings; a different developer claiming the same
  bundle id is refused. See §3.2.
- **Format is `key = value` lines, not JSON.** The requirement is that a human
  can edit the file and that bad formatting is survivable. JSON fails the
  second outright — one trailing comma loses the document — and the house
  already has three `key=value` parsers to consolidate (§1.3). Structure comes
  from dotted keys (`effects.blur`), not from nesting syntax. See §3.3.
- **A rewrite never destroys what a human wrote.** Comments, blank lines, key
  order, and lines the parser did not understand survive a `set` and a save;
  only the touched key's line changes. This is a hard requirement of the
  format engine, not a nicety.
- **The daemon is on the control path, never the bulk data path.** Blob and
  temp access is granted as a **descriptor** (`fd_grant`/`fd_redeem`), so the
  app then reads, writes, seeks, truncates, and `file_map`s directly against
  the kernel VFS at full speed. Proxying bytes through IPC is excluded by the
  1 MiB message ceiling and would be slow besides.
- **Exactly one new capability.** `CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN`, held only by `confd`.
  It is tested against §5.2's three conditions in §3.5.1. `confd`'s whole
  ceiling is that plus `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`, `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, and
  `CAP_LOG_EMIT`: no spawn, no network, no `CAP_FS_CHOWN`, and — deliberately —
  no `CAP_USERS_READ`, so a compromised store service cannot reach the
  credential database (§3.4).
- **Fail closed, degrade to defaults.** No `confd` (early boot, crashed
  service, a port with no storage) means reads answer from the bundle's
  shipped defaults and writes fail with a typed error — never a guess, never a
  silent partial write.
- **No compat shim (§2.13, §23.3).** Each migrated consumer's hand-rolled path
  is **deleted** in the stage that migrates it. There is no dual-read, no
  fallback to the old location, and no importer left behind. `abi-v1` is not
  frozen (§9), so the manifest and `Origin` changes are made in place.
- **Out of scope, deliberately.** Publisher-key *rotation* (as opposed to
  signing-key rotation) is an audited administrative re-pin, not a manifest
  lineage format (§3.2). Cross-user sharing, sync/replication, and a settings
  GUI are not in this plan. Sealed *bulk* data is not in this plan either: a
  secret crosses the wire as a setting's value and is bounded by it (§3.7).
  The `Cache/` scope an earlier draft of this layout named is **deleted**
  (§3.14): nothing in the system produces a storage-pressure signal, so a scope
  whose only difference from `Blobs/` is "the OS may drop this" would be a
  second name for one behaviour — interface built for a stage that has not
  landed, by the same rule §3.6 applied to `ConfigScope` and §3.12 to the key
  protector.

```

### 3.2 Attested app identity (the foundation)

**Manifest.** Two fields are added to `AppInfoHeader` (`lib/abi/src/appinfo.rs`):

- `publisher_pubkey: [u8; 32]` — the developer's stable Ed25519 identity.
- `publisher_cert: [u8; 64]` — proof that the publisher delegated to this
  build's signing key.

The rule, `AppInfoHeader::publisher_binding()`, enforced in `lib/appload`'s
authenticity step as a fourth check beside the existing signature and
content-hash checks:

- Self-published: `publisher_pubkey == signer_pubkey` and `publisher_cert` is
  all zero. No second signature is checked — the trust root that admitted the
  signer admitted the publisher, because they are one key.
- Delegated: `publisher_cert` must verify, against `publisher_pubkey`, as the
  publisher's signature over `AppInfoHeader::publisher_cert_message()`.
- Anything else — a claim with no certificate to justify it, a certificate
  with nothing to delegate — refuses the bundle.

The certificate's message is fixed-width and domain-labelled:
`"tairix-publisher-cert/v1" ‖ 0x00 ‖ id_len ‖ id[64] ‖ signer_pubkey`. Naming
the *identifier* as well as the key is what stops a certificate issued for one
of a publisher's bundles being lifted into another; the label stops a
signature the publisher key made for any other purpose being replayed as a
delegation. The one definition is shared by the signing tool and the load
gate, so the two can never sign and verify different messages.

Both fields are inside the region the existing manifest signature already
covers, so neither can be swapped behind a valid signature.

The **publisher id** (`PublisherId`) is
`SHA-256("tairix-publisher-id/v1" ‖ 0x00 ‖ publisher_pubkey)` — the stable,
32-byte developer identity the store keys ownership on. It is a digest rather
than the key itself for two reasons: it stays one fixed width whatever the
publisher key's algorithm (the on-disk pin and the vault KDF context are
formats, and should not be spelled in terms of one signature scheme), and it
is a value no consumer can mistake for something it may verify a signature
with. `PublisherId::NONE` (all zero) is the sentinel for a principal with no
attested publisher; no real identity can collide with it.

`lib/abi` has no dependencies and so no hash, which fixes where the pieces
live: `lib/abi` defines the two labelled preimages and the shape rule,
`lib/appload` completes the derivation and the certificate check. Neither goes
behind the loader's `Verifier` seam, because neither carries host policy —
that seam exists for the *trust root* of the manifest signer, which genuinely
differs between the kernel's embedded anchor and a user-space installer.
Putting a derivation that keys on-disk state behind a per-host trait would
invite two hosts to key the same developer's data differently.

Decoding a manifest deliberately judges **none** of this, exactly as it
verifies no signature: a surface that only draws a bundle's name and icon
(the file manager, the taskbar, the program library) must not need a trust
anchor to read a manifest. Authenticity is the gate's.

This is what makes "the signing may change for a new app version" work: the
per-build signing key is free to rotate on every release, because the store
pins the *publisher*, not the signer.

**The first-party build delegates.** `SYSTEM_APP_PUBLISHER_SEED` is a pinned
seed distinct from `SYSTEM_APP_SIGNING_SEED`, and every bundle the image build
composes is *delegated*, not self-published. This is deliberate on three
counts: the two keys answer different questions (may this run here? whose app
is this?) and only one of them is pinned by the kernel's embedded anchor, so
only one of them costs a reflash to rotate; a first-party signing-key rotation
must not silently re-key every user's store, and that property is only real if
it is exercised; and it puts the certificate path — the one a third-party
release uses — on the path every boot takes, rather than leaving it a form
only tests reach.

Nothing is added to `AppInfo.toml`. There is exactly one first-party
publisher, the composer derives it from the one pinned seed, and a key
repeated verbatim across seventy manifest sources is precisely the duplication
the charter forbids. A third-party bundle names its own publisher through its
own signing tooling; a manifest *source* key with one legal value would be
bloat.

**The identifier is a name in a directory, so its grammar is a security
rule.** `validate_bundle_id` is the one definition: dot-separated segments of
ASCII lowercase letters, digits, `-` and `_`, each non-empty and beginning
with a letter or a digit. It is applied when a manifest decodes and again
wherever an identifier crosses a trust boundary. Nothing that could be a
traversal (`.`, `..`, `/`), a hidden entry, a leading `-` an argument parser
would read as an option, a case-folding collision on a case-insensitive
volume, or a control character can be spelled at all — so "an app cannot reach
outside its own scope" holds by construction rather than by a check some
caller might forget. (The leading-character rule is AD10's: an identifier is
also a configuration key's leading segments where a registry keys on one, and
this is what makes the store-name grammar provably inside the key grammar
rather than merely similar to it — §3.15.)

**Retention.** `LoadedApp` carries a `BundleIdentity` (identifier, name,
version, publisher). The deferred-load path turns the verified identifier and
publisher into an `AppIdentity` and snapshots it onto the child's
kernel-attested capability record (`kernel/sec/src/captable.rs`, beside
`spawn_path`/`credential`/`name`) — from kernel-verified state at the call
site, never from caller-supplied bytes. It travels beside the manifest
capability request as one `VerifiedProgram`, because both come from the same
verified manifest and there must be no path that installs one without the
other.

**Exposure.** `Origin` (`lib/abi/src/origin.rs`) gains
`app: Option<AppIdentity>`, filled by `TaskCapabilities::attest_origin()`.
Every existing consumer of `call_peer_origin` and `self_origin` therefore gets
app identity for free, with no new syscall.

The two halves are **one value, whole or absent** — not two independently
empty fields. A half-filled identity (an identifier with no publisher, or the
reverse) is not representable in memory and is a refusal on the wire, so a
store can never be keyed on something nothing owns.

A principal with no bundle identity — a kernel thread, a boot principal, a
parser-sandbox child — carries no `AppIdentity` and gets **no** store: the
daemon refuses it. A sandbox child additionally has every capability stripped
structurally and cannot reach the endpoint at all; its *attribution* survives
the strip, because an audit consumer still has to be able to say what it did.

**Known consequence: a boot-floor program has no identity.** The embedded
program registry carries an `rxe` and a capability request, not a signed
manifest, so a program the kernel launches from it cannot be attributed to a
publisher and gets no store. That is honest rather than convenient: there is
nothing to attest. On the aarch64 port only PID 1 is embedded and every other
program is a store bundle, so the consequence is confined to the ports whose
storage floor has not landed yet (`plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md`); it is not worked
around here, because the fix is those ports' storage floors, not a fabricated
identity.

`confd` itself is on the embedded floor of those ports (a registry row beside
`fontd`'s), so the *service* runs identically everywhere and one boot sequence
covers every target. Its callers there are embedded programs with no signed
manifest, so it correctly serves them nothing — the consequence above, observed
rather than papered over. Leaving `confd` off that floor would instead have
made PID 1's startup config fail a spawn on those ports, which is a worse
answer: a service that is absent for a reason no log explains.

**Known consequence, stated plainly.** A shell script has no identity of its
own; it runs under the identity of the shell that interprets it, and shares
the shell's store. Scripts are not a security boundary here and this plan does
not pretend otherwise.

**Ownership pin (TOFU).** Each app's store root holds an `.owner` record —
readable only by `confd` — carrying the publisher id that created it. On every
open the attested publisher id is compared against the pin: equal proceeds,
different refuses with a typed error and an audited log record. A first write
creates the pin. Publisher-key rotation is an audited administrative re-pin
through the daemon's control surface, not a manifest field (§2).

### 3.3 The configuration format (`lib/appconf`)

One new `no_std` crate, no I/O, host-testable, fuzzed. Grammar:

```
# The user's own comment survives a save.
scheme      = dark
font.size   = 14
effects.blur = 0.5
recent.0    = /Users/ada/Documents/notes.txt
greeting    = "  leading space, a # sign, and \n an escape "
```

- One `key = value` per line. Whitespace around `=` and at line ends is
  ignored. `#` starts a comment to end of line; inside a quoted value it is
  literal.
- Keys are dot-separated lowercase segments (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`), bounded
  in length and depth. Dotted keys give structure without nesting syntax a
  hand-editor can get wrong.
- Values are bare (trimmed) or `"quoted"` with `\\ \" \n \t` escapes, for
  values that need leading/trailing space, a `#`, or a newline.
- **Tolerance.** A line that is not a valid `key = value` is *retained
  verbatim*, reported as unparsed, and never aborts the read. A duplicate key:
  last wins on read, collapsed on rewrite.
- **Preservation.** The engine models a document as an ordered line list, not
  a map, so `set` rewrites one line and leaves comments, ordering, and
  unparsed lines untouched (§2).
- Typed accessors (`bool`, `u32`, `i64`, permille) so each app validates once
  at the edge rather than re-parsing strings. A read distinguishes three
  answers — absent, valid, and *present but not that type* — so an app can
  report a broken value instead of silently substituting a default. An
  enumerated or bounded-string setting needs no accessor of its own: `get`
  hands back the already-bounded text and the app's own `from_key` closes the
  set, which is one function rather than a wrapper per shape.
- **Fractions are permille integers, not decimals.** A permille round-trips
  through text exactly, needs no float parser in a `no_std` build, and is
  already how the shipped effect strengths are expressed.
- **Every bound is a fixed security bound, not a derived capacity.** This
  corrects an error in an earlier draft of this plan, which cited §24.1: that
  section governs resource *capacities*, and §24.4 names "config length caps"
  explicitly as validation bounds on untrusted input that must stay fixed and
  fail closed. Deriving them from discovered RAM would mean a bigger machine
  accepts a bigger hostile document, which is a security regression, not
  flexibility. The document-level bounds (`MAX_DOCUMENT_LEN`, `MAX_LINES`,
  `MAX_SETTINGS`) refuse a document whole; the per-line bounds
  (`MAX_KEY_LEN`, `MAX_KEY_DEPTH`, `MAX_VALUE_LEN`) make an over-long line
  *unparsed* rather than a setting that means something else.

`lib/sysconfig`'s closed-registry system store keeps its own stricter
fail-the-whole-document semantics and is **not** folded in — that is a
deliberate difference, recorded here so the two are not later "unified" by
mistake. It also keeps its own comment tokenisation
(`tairix_util::conf::strip_comment`, which cuts at the first `#`
unconditionally): here a `#` inside a quoted value is a literal, so the
tokenisation has to know about quoting and therefore lives with the grammar
that has quotes. Two grammars, each with one implementation — not one grammar
with two.

### 3.4 Layout and layering

Within the fixed home shape (§16.3 — apps may not invent siblings):

```
/Users/<u>/Settings/Apps/               ← configuration (gated tree)
    .vault-master                         the account's app-data master secret
    <bundle-id>/
        settings.conf                     private scope
        public.conf                       public scope (foreign apps may read)
        secret.vault                      sealed scope (AEAD)
        .owner                            publisher pin
/Users/<u>/Library/Apps/<bundle-id>/    ← bulk (gated tree)
    Blobs/<name>                          durable, app-named
    Temp/<boot>-<slot>                    scratch of one boot, service-named
```

The master-secret record sits in the gated root beside the per-app directories,
because it is the *account's* key material and every app's vault key derives from
it (§3.7). Its leading dot cannot be a bundle id — the identifier grammar forbids
one — so no app's store can be named that. It is under `Settings/` rather than
`Library/` because `Library/` holds the boot-reaped scope, and key material may
not be in that.

**The gate sits on the fixed `Apps` parent, not on the per-app directory.**
This corrects an earlier draft of this plan, which put the store directly under
`Settings/<bundle-id>` and gated "both roots". Two things were wrong with it.

- A per-app directory *cannot* be the gate. Every app of a user may write
  `Settings/`, so any of them could pre-create a sibling named after another
  app's identifier — with whatever mode it liked — and have `confd` walk into
  it and serve forged settings. The gate must sit on a parent no app can
  create.
- Gating `Settings/` and `Library/` themselves is not available: `Library/`
  already holds the user's own `Trash/` (`lib/browse`), which the file manager
  must reach under the user's own identity.

So one fixed name, `Apps`, in each of the two trees. It is provisioned **with
the account** by all three home provisioners (`tools/mkimage`,
`kernel/tairix-kernel::user_admin_backing`, and the integration fixture) from
one shared definition in `lib/users/src/policy.rs`, and carries:

- owner = the `confd` service account, mode `0700`, and
- `required_cap = CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN` (§5.3's existing mechanism).

Both halves do work. The capability refuses every principal but `confd` —
including the owning user, whose shell is one more unattested principal. The
*ownership* is what makes a planted decoy harmless: `confd` verifies the root's
owner on every open, and a directory an app created is unreadable to `confd`
rather than trusted, because an app cannot chown to a service uid without
`CAP_FS_CHOWN`. A capability check alone would not catch that — `confd` holds
the capability either way.

The data stays in the user's home, so per-user backup and the volume's at-rest
encryption still apply, while `confd` is the only reachable path to it.

**Reaching the root needs a transit grant.** `confd` runs as its own service
uid, and `/Users/<u>` and `/Users/<u>/Settings` are mode `0700` owned by the
user, so `confd` cannot traverse them at all. Each carries one ACL entry
granting **search only** (`0b001`) to `confd`'s uid — the least authority that
lets a walk reach the root. It cannot list a home and cannot open any child
whose own record refuses it, so `confd` still reaches nothing but the root it
owns.

**Resolving which home.** `confd` maps the attested uid to a home by listing
`/Users` and matching the owning uid, **not** by reading the credential
database. That keeps `CAP_USERS_READ` out of its ceiling — `users_db_read`
hands over the whole `users-v1` text including PBKDF2 records, so a compromised
`confd` could otherwise exfiltrate password material for offline cracking. It
is also the more honest answer: the store must be beside the account's actual
files, and §16.3 fixes `/Users` as the only place user-owned files live. A uid
with no owned directory there gets no store, audited.

The scan is paid **once per account**, not once per read: a settings read must
not carry a directory listing that grows with the number of accounts. What is
remembered is only the resolved *path* — the ownership that authorises it is
re-checked on every use, so reassigning a home (the one act that could
invalidate a resolution, and it needs `CAP_FS_CHOWN`) cannot make a stale entry
serve the wrong account's store. Only successful resolutions are remembered, so
an account created while the service is running still resolves.

**Read layering** is the *private* scope's (§2: the published scope is one
document), lowest to highest precedence:

1. `<Bundle>.app/DefaultSettings/` — the defaults the bundle ships (§16.5).
2. `/System/Settings/<bundle-id>/` — optional machine-wide administrator
   policy.
3. The user's own file — overrides only.

Writes always land in layer 3, so a user's file never absorbs a policy value it
did not set and an unset falls back to layer 2 rather than to nothing. Defaults
are read as a **fallback layer**, not copied on first launch as §16.5 said: an
app update then ships new defaults that take effect immediately, and the user's
file holds only what the user actually changed. This is a charter amendment
(§4).

**Layers 2–3 are the daemon's; layer 1 is the client's.** The daemon reads
layer 2 and 3 from fixed paths it composes itself. Layer 1 needs the *bundle's*
path, and nothing attested gives `confd` one: `argv[0]` is caller data, and
scanning the program stores for an identifier would be a lookup that can
disagree with what is actually running. The client, by contrast, is the app —
it can read its own bundle with no lookup at all, and a wrong layer-1 value
could only ever mislead the app about itself, so no boundary is crossed. Layer 1
therefore lands in `lib/appdata` (AD5) rather than in `confd` (AD4), which is
also what makes the "no `confd`, degrade to shipped defaults" path (§2) one code
path instead of two.

### 3.5 A prerequisite the gate did not have: the capability guards the *name*

A `required_cap` on an inode governed *access to* the inode but not removal of
the name that holds it. `unlink`, `rmdir`, and `rename` authorise the **holding
directory's** write permission, and a same-parent rename never authorises the
moved node at all (POSIX only requires that when the parents differ). So any
principal that could write the parent could rename a gated directory aside and
create an ungated one of the same name — defeating the gate without ever
opening it, and leaving the gate's own service walking into the replacement.

That is a defect in the §5.3 model itself, not something this plan introduced:
it applies to every `required_cap` inode in the system. It is fixed here rather
than worked around, because a gate this plan depends on being unbypassable must
actually be unbypassable (§2.17).

The rule added: **a mutation that removes, replaces, or re-points a name whose
occupant carries a `required_cap` requires that capability** — `unlink`,
`rmdir`, and `rename` at either end, since replacing a name destroys its
occupant. It lands in both policy paths (`kernel/core/src/fs/delegate.rs` for
driver-backed mounts, `kernel/core/src/fs/vfs.rs` for the in-RAM tree) and is a
§5.3 charter amendment (§4). A hard link needs no rule of its own: a second
name shares the one inode and therefore the one security record.

**What this still does not isolate, stated plainly.** An app running as the user
can rename `~/Settings` itself aside and create a fresh one — `Settings` is the
user's own directory and carries no gate. `confd`'s ownership check then refuses
the decoy, so the outcome is that app data becomes *unavailable* and audited,
never readable or forgeable. Availability of a user's own home against their own
apps is not a boundary any service can create (the same app could delete
`~/Documents`); confidentiality and integrity of one app's data against
another's is, and that holds.

### 3.5.1 `CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN` against §5.2's three tests

1. **Guards a class, not one object.** It gates the entire app-data tree of
   every user — every app's configuration, secrets, blobs, and temporary
   files — not one file or one method.
2. **Live holder and live enforcement point in the same change.** Introduced in
   the stage that ships `confd` (its sole holder) and the per-inode gate plus
   the endpoint bind that enforce it. Nothing is defined "for later".
3. **No existing capability expresses it.** `CAP_FS_ACCESS` is held by nearly
   every app in the system, so gating on it would grant every app exactly the
   reach this plan removes.

### 3.6 The ABI (`lib/abi/src/appdata_ipc.rs`, `APPDATA_ENDPOINT`)

A reserved well-known endpoint (added to `is_reserved_endpoint`, and
deliberately **not** seat-scoped — app data is not a property of a seat and a
headless machine serves it identically), bound by `confd` under
`CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` so a squatter cannot impersonate the store.
Fail-closed requests in the house style: unknown magic, version, opcode, or a
field the operation does not use left non-zero refuses rather than guessing.

| Request | Stage | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ConfigRead { scope, capacity }` | AD4, scoped AD6 | the caller's **whole** merged document for one own scope, or the length it needs |
| `ConfigSet { scope, key, value }` | AD4, scoped AD6 | stage a write |
| `ConfigUnset { scope, key }` | AD4, scoped AD6 | stage a removal |
| `ConfigCommit { scope }` | AD4, scoped AD6 | publish that scope's staged writes atomically |
| `PublicRead { bundle_id, capacity }` | AD6 | a **foreign** app's published document |
| `VaultRead { capacity }` | AD7 | the caller's whole **sealed** document |
| `VaultSet { key, value }` / `VaultUnset { key }` | AD7 | seal or remove one secret, **immediately** |
| `BlobOpen { name, mode }` | AD8 | descriptor grant handle for a blob |
| `BlobDelete { name }` / `BlobList { capacity }` | AD8 | manage own blobs |
| `TempCreate {}` | AD9 | descriptor grant handle for a **fresh** temp file, and the name the service gave it |
| `TempRelease { name }` | AD9 | delete one of the caller's own temp files |
| `QuotaGet {}` | AD8, both scopes AD9 | own bulk usage and its ceilings |

**A read answers with the whole document, not one key.** This corrects an
earlier draft of this plan, which specified `ConfigGet { key }` and a paged
`ConfigList`. Both were the wrong shape:

- A per-key read costs the daemon a **file read and a parse per key**. An app
  with a dozen settings paid a dozen of each at start-up, which is exactly the
  premature pessimisation §2.16 forbids — and the client already links the
  format engine, so it can parse once and answer every `get` locally.
- `ConfigList` then has nothing to do: a client holding the document can
  enumerate it without a call, so the paged listing, its cursor, its
  fixed-width key record, and the `validate_key_prefix` grammar it needed were
  all surface with no consumer. All four are gone.

The reply is a whole document **or nothing**: the request declares the caller's
reply-buffer capacity, and a document that does not fit comes back as the byte
count it needs (`ConfigDocument::NeedsCapacity`) with no body. A partly
transferred document is therefore not representable, so no caller can parse a
fragment as a store or splice two snapshots together.

What the served document is: the policy layer, the app's own settings over it,
and the caller's own staged edits over those, rendered *canonically* — one line
per setting, no comments, no duplicates. That normalisation applies only to the
view; the app's own file keeps its comments, its ordering, and the lines the
grammar refused, because a save must never destroy what a human wrote.

**The record is variable-width.** Also a correction: the draft specified
fixed-width requests, and a padded frame would put a kilobyte of zeroes on the
hot settings path for a request that is sixteen bytes. It is length-prefixed
instead, bounded by `APPDATA_MAX_REQUEST`, exactly as the `users_admin` codec
is.

**The `scope` field arrived with the second scope, not before.** AD4 had exactly
one scope, so a `ConfigScope` enum with a single variant would have been
interface built for a stage that had not landed — §2.3/§2.4 forbid it, and
§2.13 blesses changing the wire in place when the second scope arrives. AD6 is
that arrival: `ConfigScope { Private, Public }` is on every own-store request,
neither variant is zero (so an all-zero frame cannot decode as a scoped
operation), and the daemon's store surface takes the scope through one
scope→file-name mapping rather than composing a name per call site.

**A foreign read is a distinct operation, not a scope.** An earlier draft of
this plan listed `PublicSet` beside `PublicRead` as though both were opcodes.
They are not, and neither half of that was right:

- Setting one's own published scope is `ConfigSet { scope: Public }`. A second
  opcode would duplicate `ConfigSet` byte for byte to select a file — the scope
  selector *is* the mechanism, and the draft's `PublicSet` named the capability
  rather than a frame.
- Reading a *foreign* one is its own opcode precisely so that it carries **no
  scope field**. A shared `ConfigRead { scope, bundle_id }` would have made
  "another app's private document" a representable request refused by a check;
  as two operations it is not representable at all. The private scope is
  unreachable across applications by construction, which is the stronger
  property and costs one discriminant.

**Both bounds on a foreign read are the ones already there.** The identifier is
bounded and validated by `validate_bundle_id` at decode — the same grammar the
manifest and the attested identity use, applied because the value becomes a path
component — and the document is bounded by `APPDATA_DOCUMENT_MAX` and answered
under the same whole-or-nothing capacity negotiation as an own read. No
operation carries an identifier *and* a setting, so `APPDATA_MAX_REQUEST` is the
wider of the two shapes rather than their sum.

The ABI is structural only. It bounds the record's shape, its lengths, and its
text encoding; the **grammar** of a key and a value has one home,
`lib/appconf`, and the daemon applies it through that engine's own validators —
the `users_admin` precedent, where the semantic field rules live in `lib/users`.
The three byte bounds are the one exception, and they are not duplicated: the
key, the value, and a whole document all cross the wire as fields, so they are
`abi-v1` widths *and* the grammar's own bounds; `lib/abi` may have no
dependencies, so the single definition lives in `appdata_ipc` and `lib/appconf`
imports it.

**Writes are staged per calling process instance and per scope.** Keyed on the
attested `ProcId` — unforgeable and never reused — so two processes of one app
cannot publish each other's half-finished edits, and on the scope, so a commit
publishes the one document a rename can replace. A commit that claimed to
publish both scopes at once would be claiming an atomicity no filesystem offers;
an app with a settings sheet open while it publishes about itself therefore has
two independent pieces of unpublished work, and the pending-edit bound is per
scope so one cannot deny the other. A session holds only its *pending edits*,
not a whole document, so it is small; the document is loaded at commit. `ConfigRead` applies the caller's own pending edits over the merged
view, so a settings sheet reads back what it just set while every other
principal still sees the committed value. A commit renders, writes a sibling
temporary, flushes, and renames over the live document, so a crash leaves either
the old document or the new one.

No primitive tells a server that a peer died, so an abandoned session is
reclaimed by **age** (`STAGING_IDLE_NS`). Losing an abandoned session's edits is
exactly the contract already stated: a caller that never commits changes
nothing.

**The table is bounded at every level of the ownership it describes.** The
per-scope key bound and age reclaim above bound one caller and one moment; they
say nothing about the sum, so staged bytes once grew with the `ConfigSet` calls
any application of any account could issue inside the reclaim window — in a
service every command app depends on, which on the 1 GiB floor is a denial of
service against every application's settings. The ceilings that close it, each
answering a question the others do not:

| Ceiling | What it bounds |
|---|---|
| `MAX_PENDING_EDITS` | distinct keys one session may stage, per scope |
| `STAGING_SESSION_MAX_BYTES` | charged bytes one calling process instance may hold |
| `STAGING_ACCOUNT_MAX_BYTES` | charged bytes one account may hold |
| `STAGING_ACCOUNT_MAX_SESSIONS` | table entries one account may hold |
| `STAGING_MAX_SESSIONS` | table entries in all |
| `STAGING_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES` | the service's whole staging footprint (8 MiB) |

- **Charged bytes include the record, not just the text.** A thousand one-byte
  keys cost the table a thousand `PendingEdit` records; charging only key and
  value would let them past every ceiling by the record's size over again — some
  fifty times the intended footprint. Allocator slack above the charge is a
  bounded constant factor and is deliberately not modelled.
- **The fairness unit is the account, and the shares are never over-committed.**
  The two account ceilings are each `1/STAGING_ACCOUNT_SHARES` (16) of the
  whole, so filling the table takes at least sixteen distinct accounts and no
  single account can take it. A per-*app* share was rejected: nothing bounds the
  number of applications an account may run, so it could yield no aggregate at
  all. Instead a process may hold half its account's share, which is what stops
  one application spending all of it and starving a sibling application of the
  same user — all of a user's applications run as that user, so the per-account
  ceiling alone would not.
- **Fixed containment bounds, not capacities (§24.4).** Same reasoning as the
  bulk ceilings in §3.8: they bound what untrusted callers may make a boot-floor
  service hold, and a bigger machine letting them hold proportionally more is a
  regression rather than flexibility. 8 MiB is under one percent of the 1 GiB
  floor and some four orders of magnitude above any real load — the client
  stages *locally* and only sends its `ConfigSet` calls inside `commit()`
  (§3.9), so a well-behaved application's service-side session lives for
  microseconds and holds only its dirty keys.
- **The entry counts are not redundant with the byte ceilings.** A session
  holding one one-byte key costs almost nothing yet still has to be searched on
  every request, and the byte ceiling alone would admit tens of thousands of
  them. Every session lookup is a scan of the table, so the count is what keeps
  that scan cheap.
- **Rejected: LRU eviction.** It bounds memory while refusing nobody, but a
  session it evicted would make the next `ConfigCommit` succeed having written
  nothing (the commit path answers `Ok` for a caller with nothing staged, which
  is the correct answer for a caller that changed no setting). That is silent
  loss of a settings sheet's unsaved edits reported as a successful save — worse
  than a refusal, and a fail-*open* where the charter requires fail-closed.
  Telling the two apart would need a tombstone per evicted session, which is
  the unbounded state the bound exists to remove.
- **A ceiling refuses no legal edit.** Half an account's share still holds a
  rewrite of *both* of an application's documents at the format's maximum size
  (~180 KiB against 256 KiB), which
  `the_widest_legal_rewrite_of_both_documents_is_admitted` enforces rather than
  asserts.
- **The bound is on memory, not a prediction that a commit will succeed.**
  Whether staged edits fit the document they publish into depends on the
  committed document, which the service has not read at staging time; reading it
  per staged edit would cost a file read each — the pessimisation the one-read
  design exists to avoid. So an over-large set of edits is still refused at the
  commit, by the format.
- **What being refused reports, and to whom.** The reply is `LimitExceeded`
  whichever ceiling was reached, so a refusal never reports another account's
  staging back to this one. Only the audit stream distinguishes an allowance the
  caller can free by committing (`STAGING_SPENT`, informational) from a table
  with no room for it (`STAGING_UNAVAILABLE`, a warning an operator acts on).
  The residual channel is inherent to any aggregate bound: an application can
  learn that its account is near its share, hence that a sibling is staging.
  It is contentless and crosses no authority boundary — sibling applications
  already run as the same user and can see each other's processes through the
  System Information API with no capability at all.

**The fairness cost, stated.** Sixteen accounts genuinely mid-edit at once can
refuse the seventeenth. No single principal can provoke that (it takes sixteen
distinct accounts, and running as another uid needs privilege), the refusal is
`LimitExceeded` rather than a loss, and the table drains on every commit and
within `STAGING_IDLE_NS` of an abandonment.

Every entry point follows §5.4: attest the caller, check authority before
touching state, validate every input, log the security-relevant decisions, fail
closed.

**The sealed scope is three opcodes, not a third `ConfigScope`.** It could have
been a scope: the machinery would mostly have worked. It is not, for the same
reason `PublicRead` is not a scope — the stronger property costs one discriminant
each way. With no scope field on a vault frame and no scope value naming a vault,
"a configuration request that reaches a secret" and "a vault request that reaches
a configuration document" are both *unrepresentable*, in either direction, rather
than refused by a check. And there is no foreign vault opcode at all, so "one app
reads another's secrets" is not a frame that exists.

It also keeps two vocabularies apart that will diverge. The sealed scope has
refusals the configuration scopes cannot have (a record that is not a vault, an
authentication that failed, key material that attests nothing) and, once a
passphrase protector lands, a *locked* state the configuration scopes will not
share. A shared `ConfigRead` would have had to answer for both.

**A sealed write is immediate, and there is no `VaultCommit`.** This is the one
place the sealed scope deliberately departs from the configuration scopes' shape.
The daemon opens the sealed document, applies the one change, re-seals, and
publishes before it replies. Two reasons, and the second is the decisive one:

- Plaintext secret material then exists in the daemon for the span of one request
  rather than for the life of a staging session that `STAGING_IDLE_NS` reclaims.
- The daemon serves requests one at a time, so the whole read-modify-seal-publish
  is **atomic**. A stage-then-commit pair is not: two processes of one app that
  each stage a different secret and then commit would each publish a document
  built from what *it* read, and the later commit would silently drop the
  other's secret. Immediate writes make that race unrepresentable, which is
  strictly *more* consistent than staging rather than a concession.

A caller that seals three secrets pays three round trips, which is the right
price for an operation an application performs when a human types a password.

Secrets are never enumerable or readable across apps — there is no foreign
equivalent of `PublicRead` for the sealed scope, and no scope field to mis-set.

### 3.7 Secrets (`secret.vault`)

ChaCha20-Poly1305 (`lib/crypto::seal`/`open`) over the same `lib/appconf`
document, so a secret is a `key = value` pair like any other.

Key hierarchy, mirroring the shape ARXFS already uses for volume keys:

```
per-account master secret         (32 random bytes, drawn once per account)
  └─ derive_key(master, "tairix-appdata-secret/v1" ‖ 0x00 ‖ publisher_id ‖ bundle_id)
       └─ per-(user, app) AEAD key
```

(`lib/crypto::derive_key` is the audited single-block HKDF-Expand the ARXFS key
hierarchy already derives its subkeys through — the same primitive, a distinct
context string, so no new cryptography is introduced (§2.12). Every field before
the identifier is fixed width and the label is fixed, so no two
(publisher, identifier) pairs can produce one context.)

Binding the derivation to the **publisher id** means a rotated signing key
still opens the vault, while a different developer squatting the bundle id
derives a different key and cannot read it even if the pin check were somehow
bypassed. Defence in depth, not a substitute for §3.2's pin.

**What the sealing buys, given that the gate already exists.** The key is bound
to the *application*, so the compromise that matters — a defect that lets one
app's request reach another's store directory — yields ciphertext it has no key
for. And the AEAD authenticates the record, so a damaged or altered sealed
document is *refused* rather than parsed: a vault that cannot be opened must
never read as "this application has no secrets", because an application deciding
whether to prompt for a password would take the wrong branch.

**What protects the master secret, and why there is no protector seam.** This
corrects an earlier draft of this plan, which specified a caller-supplied
"key-protector seam" with a volume-backed stage-1 protector. The seam was
interface built for a stage that has not landed, by the same rule §3.6 applies
to `ConfigScope`: AD7 has exactly one protector, so a protector enum with one
variant — and a salt, nonce, and tag with nothing to put in them — is forbidden
(§2.3/§2.4). Worse, it would have been dishonest: the stage-1 protector holds no
secret of its own, so the "wrap" could only have used a key derivable by anyone
who could read the record, which is theatre rather than defence.

What actually protects it is stated plainly instead. The master secret is stored
as drawn, in the gated store root (`.vault-master`): owned by `confd`, mode
`0700`, gated on `CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN`, on a volume ARXFS has no plaintext mode
for. So secrets are exactly as safe at rest as the volume, they survive an
administrative password reset, and an application — including the account's own
shell — cannot reach the record at all. The record carries a version and binds
the account's uid; the stage that brings the first protector with a real second
secret (a login passphrase, so secrets are locked while logged out; TPM sealing,
`plans/TPM.md`) reshapes it in place to carry a keyslot, which is exactly the
in-place evolution §2.13 blesses.

**A record that attests nothing is never replaced.** The same master secret is
every application's key material in that account, so drawing a fresh one to get
past a damaged or absent record would strand every existing vault while looking
like a clean start. It refuses, audited, and an operator restores it. For the
same reason the record is written through the atomic replacement every other
document uses: a torn write would produce exactly the record that can never be
replaced.

**No master secret is cached.** It is read afresh for each sealed operation,
used, and wiped. A vault write is a rare, human-driven act, and holding an
account's key material in the service's heap for the life of the machine would
buy a file read it does not need.

**Plaintext lifetime.** A sealed write is not staged (§3.6), so plaintext secret
material exists in the daemon for the span of one request. The transient buffers
that carry it are wiped: `lib/appconf` wipes every line a document discards and
every line of a document that goes out of scope (which is what makes the format
engine, not its callers, responsible for it), the rendered text is sealed in
place so the plaintext allocation *becomes* the ciphertext, and the service
binary wipes the request and reply frames it reuses across callers.

**Known limit, stated honestly.** A secret crosses the wire as a setting's
value, so it is bounded by `APPDATA_VALUE_MAX` (1 KiB). That covers a password,
a token, or a symmetric key, and not a certificate chain or a large private key.
Sealed *bulk* data is not in this plan: AD8's blobs are descriptor-backed and
unsealed, and giving them a sealed mode is a separate decision with its own
nonce discipline, not a widening of this bound.

### 3.8 Blobs and temporary files

`BlobOpen` and `TempCreate` return a **grant handle** minted by `fd_grant`,
scoped to the calling task and useless to a bystander. The app `fd_redeem`s it
and then uses `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_truncate`, and `file_map` directly.
That gives streaming, random access, and memory mapping at kernel VFS speed,
with `confd` making the policy decision once at open and never touching a byte
of payload.

Temp files live in `Library/<bundle-id>/Temp/` and are gated identically — an
app's scratch data is no more visible to another app than its settings are.
There is still no `/tmp` and nothing here creates one (§16.1).

The **service names them**, and nothing opens one: `TempCreate` carries no name
and there is no `TempOpen`, so the only way to hold a temp file is to have just
created it. That is what a temp file is for — freshness with no coordination —
and it also means an app can never *read* scratch it did not write in this
process, not even its own from an earlier run. The name it is handed back is
good for one thing, `TempRelease`. Their lifetime is the **boot**, and the name
says which one; §3.14 records why that is the boundary, why the reap is lazy,
and why a session-end reap is not built.

**A delegation attenuates by mode *and* by extent, and that is a kernel
change.** `fd_grant` existed for the file picker's read-only hand-off: it
refuses a descriptor that is not read-only and mints `OpenFlags::READ`, and only
`fs_read` accepts the result at all — `fs_write` refuses a delegated backing
outright, and `fs_stat`, `fs_truncate`, `fs_sync`, and `file_map` all resolve a
descriptor's *path* through a method that answers `None` for one. So a blob
descriptor as this plan promised it did not exist, and half a file API on a
delegated descriptor would be a defect in its own right. AD8 therefore makes a
delegation a whole descriptor:

- `fd_grant` mints the **grantor descriptor's own** access mode rather than a
  hard-coded read, so a delegation never conveys more than the grantor opened.
  It names its recipient by the attested `ProcId` the dispatcher read on the
  request's own ticket (`origin.proc_id()`), never by a task id: an id is
  redrawn once its task is gone, and the instance is recorded so only the
  application that asked can redeem.
  A directory and a non-path backing stay refused, and the open-time flags
  (`CREATE`, `TRUNCATE`, `APPEND`, `NO_FOLLOW`) are not carried: the file is
  already open, and an `APPEND` delegation would silently move every write to
  a position the recipient did not name.
- Every path-backed descriptor operation resolves *whose* authority it runs
  under from **one** place, so "a delegation runs under the grantor's captured
  identity, never the holder's" holds for the whole file API instead of for
  reads alone.
- `fs_stat`, `fs_truncate`, `fs_sync`, and `file_map` stop carrying a blanket
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS` gate at dispatch and apply it per backing, exactly as
  `fs_read` and `fs_write` already do. Nothing widens — a caller's own
  path-backed descriptor faces the same requirement one line later — but a
  recipient that holds no filesystem capability can now use the descriptor it
  was given, which is the whole point of a delegation. `fs_readdir` keeps its
  blanket gate, because `fd_grant` refuses a directory and so no delegated form
  of it exists.
- A writable delegation carries a **write-extent ceiling** and there is no way
  to mint one without it: the ceiling must be zero for a read-only grant and
  non-zero for a writable one, so "an unbounded writable delegation" is not a
  representable request. `fs_write` past the ceiling and `fs_truncate` above it
  are refused with `LimitExceeded`; the check is on `offset + len`, so a sparse
  write cannot step over it either.

**Quotas, and a correction.** An earlier draft of this plan said the ceilings
were "derived from the resource profile rather than fixed constants (§24.1)"
and recorded a per-descriptor cap as out of scope. Both were wrong, and for
the same reason the format bounds were corrected in §3.3: §24.1 governs
resource *capacities*, and these are not capacities.

- **They are containment bounds, so they are fixed (§24.4).** They bound what
  one application may take from *the user's volume* — a resource it does not
  own and cannot be trusted to size. Deriving them from discovered RAM would
  mean a bigger machine lets one application hide a bigger unmanaged pile of
  data in a store the user cannot list or delete, which is a regression, not
  flexibility. There is no honest hardware quantity to derive from either: the
  boot facts carry CPU count and installed memory, and neither is a disk.
- **A count per scope and one byte ceiling for the tree, and the per-app worst
  case is stated as such.** A per-app blob *count* (`APPDATA_BLOB_MAX_COUNT`),
  a per-app live-temp-file *count* (`APPDATA_TEMP_MAX_COUNT`), and one
  per-file *byte* ceiling (`APPDATA_BULK_FILE_MAX_BYTES`). The counts differ
  because the questions do: how many durable objects an app's working set has,
  and how many scratch files it holds *at once* — a slot a release frees
  immediately, so the temp count is deliberately tighter. The byte ceiling is
  one figure because it answers one question — how big may a file the user can
  neither list nor delete become — and that does not turn on whether the file
  outlives the boot; two constants that would always be set equal are the
  duplication §2.2 forbids. The blob count additionally makes a listing one
  reply frame. Every open file is bounded by the one ceiling, so the app's
  whole bulk store is bounded by (blob count + temp count) × bytes — a *hard*
  bound, not an admission estimate.
- **An admission check alone would have been theatre.** Summing an app's blob
  sizes at open time and refusing the next open does nothing about the blob it
  already holds open, which it can grow without limit. A defence a hostile app
  defeats in one line is worse than none, because it reads as an assurance. So
  the bound is the delegation's extent, and the count ceiling is the only thing
  admission decides.
- **Why a fixed byte ceiling is the right answer and not a compromise.** The
  blob store is an application's private *working set* — an index, a cache, a
  queue: exactly the data that must not be in the user's Documents. Data that
  genuinely outgrows it is the *user's* data, and it belongs in the user's own
  files, under the user's own authority, where the file manager lists it,
  backup covers it, and the user can delete it. An application that would hide
  a hundred gigabytes in a store the user cannot reach is the thing this
  ceiling exists to prevent, not a workload it fails to serve. `QuotaGet`
  reports every ceiling and the usage against it — both scopes in one answer,
  because an app deciding whether to spill to scratch or evict a cached index
  must not read two moments — so an application that reaches one says so
  rather than failing obscurely.

**What is still not bounded, stated honestly.** Nothing bounds the *number of
applications* an account may run, so the sum over an account's apps is bounded
only by the volume. A per-account or per-volume quota is the filesystem's to
enforce and ARXFS has none yet; it is not faked here. What does hold is that no
single application can exceed its counts × bytes, and that the store's bytes are
owned by the app-data service rather than by the user — because the user must
not be able to reach them — so a future per-*user* filesystem quota would never
have caught this path anyway. That is precisely why the bound has to live here.

### 3.9 The client API (`lib/appdata`)

```rust
let mut s = Settings::open(&mut host, OWN_WORD);   // one call: the whole document
let size = s.u32("font.size")?.unwrap_or(14);     // local, no call
s.set_u32("font.size", 16)?;                      // stages, locally
s.commit()?;                                      // publishes, atomically

let mut mine = Settings::open_published(&mut host);   // own published scope
mine.set("font.family", "berkeley")?; mine.commit()?;
let theirs = read_published(&mut host, "os.tairix.terminal")?;  // foreign snapshot

let mut v = Vault::open(&mut host)?;         // sealed scope; may fail
v.set("imap.password", secret)?;            // sealed before it returns

let grant = blobs::open(&mut host, "index", BlobMode::ReadWrite)?; // handle
let index = File::from_delegation(grant)?;                        // real fd

let scratch = temp::create(&mut host)?;      // a fresh file, service-named
let spill = File::from_delegation(scratch.grant)?;
temp::release(&mut host, &scratch.name)?;    // done with it

let used = bulk_quota(&mut host)?;           // both bulk scopes, one moment
```

**A foreign read hands back a `Document`, not a handle.** An earlier sketch in
this plan wrote it as `Settings::open_public(id)`, which implied a handle over
another app's store — and a handle is a thing a later call site can commit
through. A foreign read is one read with nothing to hold open, so it answers the
format engine's own document value: read-only in the only sense that matters
(nothing can publish through it), and carrying the engine's typed accessors, so
the published scope needs no accessor of its own. `open_published` takes no
command word, because that scope has no bundle-shipped layer to resolve one for
(§3.4).

`open` costs one `ConfigRead`; every `get` after it is a lookup in the document
the client already holds and parsed, so an app's start-up cost does not grow
with the number of settings it consults. The client also owns the
bundle-defaults layer (§3.4), so a `get` that the store does not answer falls
back to the app's own shipped default without a call either.

No app ever spells a store path, and no app names its own bundle id. Both come
from the attested identity, so an app cannot reach outside its own scope by
construction rather than by check. The one argument `open` takes is the
program's own **command word**, which selects nothing but layer 1 — resolved
through the shared `lib/cmdres` order, the same one the shell launches through
and `man` reads a bundle's help from, so an app's shipped defaults and its help
can never come from different bundles.

**A `set` whose value the layers already answer with stages nothing.** That one
rule is what makes "the user's file holds only what the user actually changed"
structural rather than each app's discipline: a value already coming from the
policy or defaults layer is never copied up, and an app that saves a setting it
did not change does not rewrite the user's document at all. Its converse is
that *removing* an opinion is an explicit `unset`, and that the effective value
it uncovers is the **service's** answer to give — so a commit ends by re-reading
the store rather than letting the client guess what a lower layer says. A
commit answers whether its edits **landed**: a re-read that fails after them is
recorded in `store_refusal`, never reported as the commit failing, because a
caller that puts its screen back on a failed commit would otherwise show a value
the store — and the next start — has already replaced.

**Writes are staged locally and pushed at commit.** A `set` is memory; the
`ConfigSet` frames go over the wire only when `commit` is called, so a caller
that stages ten keys and never commits costs the service nothing and holds no
staging session open. That also shrinks the abandoned-session window §3.6
reclaims by age to the span of one save.

**`Vault` is the one handle that can fail to open, and the one with no commit.**
`Settings::open` degrades to the shipped defaults and records why, because an
application must still run; `Vault::open` returns the refusal, because "I could
not read your secrets" is not "you have none" and an application that concluded
the second would prompt the user to re-enter a password it already holds. And
there is nothing to commit: the service seals each `set`/`unset` before it
replies, so a `Vault` holds no unsaved work at all. A value the vault already
holds, and a removal of a key it does not, each cost no call.

A sealed write **ends by re-reading**, exactly as a commit does, and for the
same reason: once a write has landed the service is the only thing that knows
what the sealed document says, and applying the change to the client's own copy
instead would be a guess — one that is wrong the moment another instance of the
application has sealed something of its own. A write that lands and is then
followed by a failed re-read reports the re-read's error and keeps the handle's
previous view; retrying the write is harmless, because sealing a value the vault
already holds costs nothing. This is where a vault parts from a commit: a
`Settings` handle already reads its staged edits, so its commit can answer
whether they landed, while a vault handle holds only what the service said and
has no new secret to go on reading.

### 3.10 What the first migration settled

Migrating a real consumer with a settings sheet behind it (`terminal`) decided
three things the API sketch had left open, and each is now the rule for every
migration after it.

**"Restore defaults" is an `unset`, not a write.** The sheet used to reset its
in-memory profile to the app's compiled defaults and save that, which froze
today's values into the user's document: a machine-wide policy, or a later
version's better default, would then never apply again. It cannot be fixed
inside the sheet either — "the defaults" means the layers *beneath* the user's
own document, and only the store knows what they say. So the sheet reports the
request, the program removes the user's opinions, re-reads the profile that then
applies, and hands it back for the sheet to show. The widget states the intent;
the store answers it.

**An app keeps its own closed registry over the store's open namespace.** The
store's keys are an open namespace the app owns, but an app reads a *fixed* set
of them, so the migrated profile keeps its enumerated key type and its typed
field bridges — declared as a `tairix_appconf::Registry`, whose engine every app
shares (AD11): a value the registry refuses leaves that one field at its
documented default and is *named* to the caller, which reports it. One broken
setting costs only itself, and a key the registry does not know is one the app
leaves alone rather than destroying on the next save.

**A bundle ships no defaults document unless its defaults are genuinely data.**
`terminal`'s defaults are its code's — `Profile::default` is the last-resort
answer when nothing else applies — so shipping a `DefaultSettings/settings.conf`
that restated them would be exactly the duplication §2.2 forbids, with the
divergence risk that goes with it. Layer 1 is therefore implemented and tested
but deliberately unused by this consumer: it exists for a bundle whose defaults
*are* data (an integrator's themed build, a keymap, a shipped catalogue), which
is what §16.5 declares the entry for. Stating that here is what stops a later
migration adding a defaults file "for symmetry".

### 3.11 What the second scope settled

**One pin, two scopes.** The `.owner` record attests who owns the *data*, and
both documents are the same app's, so there is one pin and not one per scope. A
squatting publisher is therefore refused before it can put anything in front of
readers of the real app's published document — the pin does double duty as an
integrity guarantee for the sharing channel, not only for the private one.

**A publish is per document, and the temporary name is derived from it.** The
sibling a publish writes before renaming is the live name plus `.new`, computed
rather than declared per scope: it is then always a sibling in the app's own
store directory, two scopes can never contend for it, and the rename can never
cross a volume. Two constants would have been two things to keep in step.

**A foreign read sees committed data only.** A published value is what every
*other* app sees, so it is the committed document; a publisher's staging is its
own business, and a reader must not act on a value that may never be published.
The publisher's own `ConfigRead { Public }` still shows what it staged, so a
"publish this" surface reads back what it just set.

**No value stands for "another app's store".** The foreign path is a free
function returning a document, not a type holding a directory: a value standing
for someone else's store is a value a later call site could publish through.
There is nothing to hold, so there is nothing to misuse.

**The scope is not yet consumed by a first-party app, and that is stated rather
than papered over.** AD6 lands a platform facility: `abi-v1` surface an
application — including one not in this tree — integrates through, exactly as
AD4 landed `confd` before AD5's first client existed. What holds it honest in
the meantime is that every property above is tested through the *real* codec, on
both sides (the daemon's dispatcher over an in-memory volume, and the client
over the shared fake), rather than through a mock. The first in-tree consumer is AD10's
`pinboard` document, which a settings surface read by opening the
session's file directly (§1.5) — the concrete instance of the defect this scope
closes. It is left to that stage rather than pulled in here because it also has
to replace `lib/wallpaper`'s own `key = value` engine (§1.3) and settle whether
the desktop session runs under an attested app identity at all; a migration with
those two questions open is not a smaller change than the mechanism.

AD10 landed both, and a second consumer with the ownership the other way round
— the program library, where the *writer* owns the scope and the session takes
the foreign path (§3.16, §3.17).

### 3.12 What the sealed scope settled

**The wipe belongs to the format engine, not to its callers.** The sealed scope
is a `lib/appconf` document, so a line the engine discards — an overwritten
setting, a collapsed duplicate, an `unset` removal, every line of a document
going out of scope — may hold a secret. Wiping in `Line`'s `Drop` rather than at
each call site is what makes it hold for *every* discard path, including ones a
later change adds: a caller cannot forget. The cost is a memset of bytes that
were about to be freed anyway, and it removes the alternative — a `wipe()` method
every consumer must remember to call, which is the shape that eventually gets
missed. `Document` also implements no `Debug`, so it cannot reach a log by
construction.

**No protector abstraction, and the reason is the same one AD6 gave for
`ConfigScope`.** AD7 has exactly one protector, so a protector enum with one
variant and a keyslot with nothing to put in it would be interface built for a
stage that has not landed. The honest alternative is to say plainly what protects
the master secret today (§3.7) and to leave the record versioned so the stage
that brings a real second secret reshapes it in place.

**A refusal is never an absence, and this is where that rule earns its keep.**
The published scope deliberately answers an empty document for a target-side
defect (§3.6) — there, indistinguishability is the *point*, because a reader must
learn nothing but what an app published. The sealed scope is the caller's own
data, so the opposite holds: every defect is reported as itself, precisely
because the caller can act on it and because an application that reads a damaged
vault as empty will overwrite or re-prompt. Two scopes, opposite rules, one
reason: report what the caller can act on, and nothing else.

**The service is now the principal that holds every account's secrets, and that
is stated rather than glossed.** Compromising `confd` yields applications'
settings *and* their secrets. No arrangement in which one service can both seal
and open vaults avoids that, and the alternative — each app holding its own key —
is exactly the "every app invents its own storage" arrangement this plan deletes,
with no place to put the key. What the sealing does buy is stated in §3.7: the
key is per-application, so a defect that lets one app's request reach another's
store directory yields ciphertext, and a damaged record is refused rather than
believed. What `confd` still cannot reach is unchanged: no credential record, no
other user's files, no process.

### 3.13 What the blob scope settled

**A name in the store has one grammar, whatever names it.** A blob name and a
bundle identifier are both a single component in a tree this service composes
paths into, so they are the same security question and get the same answer: one
validator, one width, two entry points named for what they validate. Writing a
second character-class loop for blob names would have been the duplication the
charter forbids *and* two chances to disagree about whether `..` is a name.

**A listing is whole or nothing, and needs no cursor.** An earlier draft of this
plan specified `BlobList { cursor }`. It does not need one: the blob count is
bounded, so a whole listing fits one reply under the same capacity negotiation a
document read uses. That is the argument §3.6 already made for deleting
`ConfigList` — a paged listing can be assembled out of two snapshots and a
whole one cannot — and it applies with more force here, because a listing spliced
across a delete would name a blob that no longer exists.

**One pin, every tree — and creating a blob creates the pin.** The `.owner`
record lives in the configuration store and governs the bulk store too, because
it attests who owns the *application's data* and not who owns one file. A blob
open therefore resolves and pins through the configuration root first and
reaches `Library/` only behind that check, so a squatting publisher is refused
before a byte of another developer's blob is reachable. Two pins would have been
two records to keep in step and a state where they disagree.

That is only a guarantee if the pin cannot be *skipped*, which a first draft of
this stage got wrong: opening the configuration store without `create` on the
blob path left an application that had written no setting unpinned, so a blob it
created had no recorded owner — and a later publisher claiming the identifier
passed the pin check vacuously and read it. Two rules close it, and the second
is what makes the first structural: creating a blob passes `create` to the
*configuration* store too, so the pin exists before the blob does; and an
unpinned store holds **no** blobs whatever is on the volume, exactly as an
unpinned configuration store reads as an empty document. With no attested owner
there is nothing to serve, so "a store with data nobody owns" is not a state the
service can be in rather than one it checks for.

**A blob is created by opening it for writing, not by a third mode.** A
read-only open of an absent blob is `NotFound`; a read-write open creates it.
That is one bit of information carried by the mode the caller already sends,
rather than a create flag that could be set with `Read` and mean nothing.

**The service closes its own descriptor before it replies.** A delegation
record is self-contained — it carries the path and the grantor's captured
credential, not the grantor's descriptor — so `confd` opens, mints, and closes
within one request and holds no per-caller descriptor state at all. There is no
primitive by which a server learns that a peer closed a descriptor, so a service
that kept one open per outstanding grant could never reclaim it; the design
avoids needing to.

**Blob bytes are the service's, and that is why the service must bound them.**
The gated tree is owned by `confd` precisely so the account's own shell cannot
reach it, which means every byte an application writes to a blob is charged to
the service's uid and not the user's. No per-user filesystem quota, present or
future, will ever see it. The extent ceiling in the delegation is therefore not
a belt-and-braces addition to a filesystem quota — it is the only bound that
will ever exist on that path, which is what makes it mandatory rather than
optional (§3.8).

### 3.14 What the temporary scope settled

**A temporary file is one nothing can open.** `TempCreate` carries no name and
there is no `TempOpen`, so the only way to hold one is to have just created it.
That is not an omission: freshness without coordination is the whole of what a
scratch file is for, and a scope where the app named its own files would let two
instances that both chose `spill` corrupt each other — the very defect §1.1
describes, reproduced inside one bundle. Because nothing opens one, an app can
never *read* scratch it did not write in this process, not even its own from an
earlier run. The name it is handed back is good for exactly one thing,
`TempRelease`, and the service composes the path from the *caller's* attested
store, so naming another app's file reaches nothing.

**Unlinking at creation was the first thing tried, and the VFS is right to
refuse it.** The POSIX trick — create, hand over the descriptor, unlink the name
— would make a temp file's lifetime exactly its descriptor's and need no reaper
at all. It is not available here, and not because of an oversight: a delegation
record carries the **path** and the grantor's captured credential, not an inode,
precisely so every operation on a delegated descriptor is re-authorised through
the secured VFS with no cached authority (`kernel/core/src/aspace.rs`). Unlinking
would break the descriptor. Keeping a name is also what lets the service *bound*
the scope — an anonymous file it cannot enumerate is one it cannot count, and it
has no primitive by which to learn that a peer closed a descriptor, so an
in-memory count could only ever grow. The named form is what makes
count × bytes a hard bound rather than an aspiration.

**The boundary is the boot, and the name carries it.** A temp file is
`<boot-id>-<slot>`, both lowercase hex, so a file's own name says which boot it
belongs to. An earlier boot's is invisible to every answer the service gives and
is reclaimed before the next file is created. Three things fall out of that, and
each was a defect in the alternatives:

- **No marker record to keep in step.** A `.boot` file beside the scratch would
  be a second source of truth a torn write could contradict; the name cannot
  disagree with itself.
- **A service restart reaps nothing.** The boot id is the kernel's, minted once
  per boot, so `confd` crashing and being relaunched leaves every running app's
  scratch exactly where it was. Anything keyed on the *service's* own lifetime
  would have deleted live files.
- **No boot-time walk of every account's every store.** The sweep is paid by the
  one operation that needs the room, and only for the app that asked, so an
  early-boot service does not stat its way through `/Users` before it can answer
  a settings read.

**The slot is drawn, not counted, and that is a correctness argument rather than
a security one.** A per-process counter would have to be remembered somewhere,
and whatever remembers it must eventually forget — after which a name would be
re-issued, and a caller that released the same name twice would delete a *later*
file it had never seen. Drawing eight bytes makes that unrepresentable. A drawn
name that turns out to be taken is therefore not a collision to retry past: it
means the generator is not delivering the randomness it claimed, so the create
refuses rather than handing over another instance's open scratch.

**A boot with no identity is refused, and nothing else is.** A port whose random
reserve never seeded reports `BootId::UNSET`, and with it the service cannot tell
one boot's scratch from another's — so it serves the scope not at all rather than
leaving files it could never reclaim. Every other scope answers normally: an
unseeded generator is a reason to refuse *scratch*, never a reason to refuse a
user their settings. A quota read still answers, reporting no temporary files,
because an app asking about its blobs is not the caller to refuse for a scope it
did not ask about.

**There is no session-end reap, and that is a decision rather than an omission.**
The plan's earlier wording promised one. Building it would have meant a
privileged control operation on the one endpoint that holds every account's
secrets, wired from whichever principal ends a session — new privileged surface
on the highest-value service in the system. What it would buy is *earlier
reclamation of bytes*, and nothing else: because nothing opens a temporary file,
no application can observe another session's scratch even while it is still on
the volume, and the count ceiling bounds how much of it there can be. The
boundary that is attested, free, and correct after a crash is the boot, so that
is the one the scope keeps. If a storage-pressure signal ever lands, reclaiming
sooner becomes that signal's business, not a new capability's.

**A release exists because an API that creates and cannot destroy forces a
leak.** Without it a long-lived application — a spooler, a browser, an editor
opening many buffers — would climb to the ceiling over one boot and then be
refused with no recourse. With it, an application that finishes with its scratch
holds one slot at a time. What an application that never releases costs is
itself: its own ceiling, until the next boot.

**The `Cache/` scope in the layout is deleted rather than built.** It would have
differed from `Blobs/` in exactly one way — the OS may drop it under storage
pressure — and there is no storage-pressure signal in the system to drop it on.
A scope with no distinct behaviour is two names for one thing, which is what
§2.3/§2.4 forbid and what §3.6 and §3.12 already refused for `ConfigScope` and
the key protector. When an evictor lands it brings the scope it needs.

**One `Scope` serves both, and the two faces are what differ.** Resolving the
directory, proving the gated bulk root, enumerating it, unlinking from it, and
minting its delegation are the same act for a blob and for scratch, so they have
one implementation; `BlobStore` and `TempStore` add only the rule that is their
own — who names a file, which names are live, and which ceiling admits one. A
single type with a scope discriminant would have had methods that are meaningless
for half its values, which is the shape that eventually gets called wrongly.

### 3.15 What the remaining migrations settled

Three consumers moved at once, and between them they exercised every scope the
store has. Each settled a rule that is now the rule for anything migrating
after them.

**A registry reads from whichever surface holds its document, so the question
is named once.** An application's closed registry is a fixed set of keys read
out of *something*: its own layered handle for the private scope, the same for
the published one it writes, and the format engine's own `Document` for one
another application published or one that arrived over a channel. Those are
different types with one question between them, so
`tairix_appconf::Lookup` names it and every registry is written once against
it. Before AD10 each registry took a concrete `Settings`, which was fine while
only the private scope had consumers; the first *shared* document made a
second loader the alternative, and a second loader is how two of them come to
disagree about what a missing key means.

**Two readings of one registry, and which is which is decided by who wrote
the document.** A document held in a *store* is read tolerantly: a value the
registry refuses leaves that one field at its documented default and is
*named* to the caller. A document that arrived over a *channel* is read
strictly: a line outside the grammar, a key outside the registry, or a value
outside a key's closed set refuses the whole thing. The two rules look
contradictory and are the same rule applied to two facts. A stored value may
predate this build and a person may have to live with it, so blanking a
desktop over one stale setting is the wrong answer; a value on the wire was
rendered by a program from this same registry moments ago, so it is a defect
in the *sender*, and adopting a desktop the sender did not describe is worse
than refusing it. `lib/wallpaper` carries both and says which is which at each
entry point.

A useful consequence falls out of the pairing, and it falls out the right way
round: the **store** is forward-compatible and the **wire** is not. A document
a later build wrote with a sixth key is read by an earlier build's tolerant
reading, which ignores what it does not know; the same key on the wire is
refused. That is the correct asymmetry, because a stored document outlives the
build that wrote it and a request does not.

**A *catalog* is read strictly whichever surface holds it, and that is not an
exception.** The tolerant rule is a rule about *fields*: one bad value costs
its own field and every other field still stands. A catalog is a **list**, so
there is no such thing as the field costing only itself — a record the reader
skipped is an application that silently vanishes from a launcher, with nothing
left standing to say anything is missing. `lib/proglib` therefore refuses the
whole document, and its readers fall back to the empty catalog and *say so*.

**A store name is a legal configuration key, and that is now enforced rather
than assumed.** The program library keys on `<id>.<field>`, so a bundle
identifier is a key's leading segments. `validate_store_name` admitted a
segment beginning with `-` or `_` where `validate_key` did not, which would
have made a legal identifier a key no document could hold — a record silently
dropped at render. The store-name grammar is tightened to match (a segment
begins with a lowercase letter or a digit), `lib/appconf` pins the containment
in a test, and `EntryId` stops carrying a second character-class loop and
defers to `validate_bundle_id`. A tightening, so it can only refuse more; the
leading `-` it now refuses is also the shape an argument parser mistakes for
an option.

**The client can enumerate, because an open key namespace is a real kind of
app data.** A closed registry never needs it — it reads the keys it knows and
leaves the rest alone — but a catalog, a recent-file list, or a per-host
preference set does, and so does anything that must *replace* a scope rather
than edit fields of it. `Settings::settings` answers it from the document the
client already holds, with no call: exactly the property §3.6 gave as the
reason the wire carries no listing operation at all.

**A publisher's identifier is spelled in two systems, so the bundle pins it.**
A published scope's reader names the publisher, and §3.9's rule stands — no
application names *its own* bundle id, so the writer names nothing. That
leaves the identifier in two places by necessity: a signed `AppInfo` manifest
on the writer's side and a Rust constant on the reader's, which no single
definition can span. A rename would then silently turn a foreign read into an
empty document — the one failure the published scope is designed to be
indistinguishable from. So the *publishing bundle's own crate* asserts, in a
unit test, that the constant names it: `include_str!("../AppInfo.toml")` is a
sibling file, so the pin sits where the manifest is and cannot go looking for
one across the tree.

### 3.16 What the pinboard migration settled

**The desktop session runs under an attested app identity, and that is what
made the whole scope possible.** It is spawned from
`/System/Applications/desktop.app/Run` through the same signed load gate every
other bundle is, so it is `os.tairix.desktop` to the store exactly as the
terminal is `os.tairix.terminal`. The question §3.11 left open therefore has
an unremarkable answer, and no fallback for an identity-less session was built
— there is no such session on a port whose storage floor has landed.

**One document, in the published scope, with every key in it.** The pinboard
settings could have been split — the chooser needs the wallpaper, the fit and
the backdrop; the icon flow and sort order are the desktop's own business —
and the split was rejected. Two scopes are two commits, and §3.11 already
established that no commit spans two documents; an *apply* from the chooser
carries all five keys, so the split would have turned one atomic replacement
into two, with a crash between them leaving a desktop half of what the user
asked for. What the extra three keys leak to a reader is an icon sort order.
Atomicity is worth more.

**The write asymmetry is forced, and it is the right shape.** The chooser
reads the document directly and cannot write it at all, because an application
publishes only its own scope. So it keeps asking over the pinboard channel and
the session keeps deciding — which is what the channel was always for. The
half that was unmediated is the half that moved.

**A session that writes no file needs no file writer.** `SessionFileWriter`
existed for exactly one document, and its own doc comment said so. With the
pinboard settings in the store, the desktop session writes *nothing* through
the VFS, so the seam and its `VfsFileWriter` are deleted rather than left as a
capability-shaped hole for the next consumer to reach through.

**A refusal the format no longer has is a rule to delete, not to re-justify.**
`WallpaperPath` refused a `#` because the hand-rolled grammar cut a line at the
first one. `lib/appconf` quotes such a value and round-trips it exactly, so the
refusal's stated reason had become false — and a rule with a false reason is
worse than no rule. It is removed, and the path grammar is the only thing
judging a path. The *colour* keeps its one bare `rrggbb` spelling, which is now
honestly labelled a registry rule rather than a grammar one.

### 3.17 What the program library settled

**Only the per-user layer is per-app data, and only it moved.** The
machine-wide catalog at `/System/Settings/ProgramLibrary/library.conf` is
administrator policy — every account reads it, only a principal that tree's
policy admits rewrites it — and it is not any one application's data. Putting
it in a command's store would have made a machine's library the property of
that command. §1.1's defect names the *overlay*, and the overlay is what moved.

**The overlay is `applib`'s published scope, because the editor must own what
it edits.** `applib` is a shell command that has to work with no desktop
running, so the session cannot own the document and hand out edits the way it
does for the pinboard. Ownership therefore sits with the writer, and the
reader — the session — takes the foreign path. That is the second in-tree
instance of §1.5's channel, and it arrived at the opposite arrangement from the
first for a reason that is visible in one sentence: *the principal that must be
able to write when nothing else is running is the one that owns the store.*

**One registry, two backings of one seam.** The tool's `Store` seam now trades
`lib/appconf` documents; the machine layer's backing is the VFS and the
overlay's is the app-data client. The editing engine never learns where a
catalog lives, so `--user` is one branch in one function rather than a second
code path — and the app-data backing is host-testable over the shared fake,
which the old file-only seam's production half never was.

**The record ceiling is derived from the format, and the *division* is the
point.** `MAX_ENTRIES` was `4096`, chosen — its own comment said — to sit "far
above any plausible number of installed applications" purely to bound
allocation. The format engine now bounds allocation, so the number is derived:
`MAX_SETTINGS / EntryKey::ALL.len()`.

The first attempt was `MAX_SETTINGS` itself, on the reasoning that a record
needs at least one setting so no document can hold more records than settings.
That was wrong, and reviewing it caught a real data-loss path: a catalog
bounded only by the *setting* count can be built in memory — `applib rescan`
on a machine with two hundred listed bundles would build one — and then not
fit the document it must be written to, and a render that does not fit would
have to drop records. Dividing by what one record costs at its widest makes
the render **total** instead, so the refusal lands at the `insert`, `patch`, or
`reconcile` that would exceed the bound, where the tool can name it, rather
than at save time where nothing would. A unit test builds a catalog at the
bound with every field set and asserts every setting survives the round trip.

The resulting ceiling — around a hundred fully-specified entries — is the
honest consequence of a catalog being *one* document that must fit one
whole-or-nothing read and one atomic publish, because a store no reader can
snapshot whole is one no reader can trust. Stated here so that a library which
ever genuinely outgrows it is answered with a scope shaped for a list, and not
with a wider settings document.

**Editing the overlay needs no home, and `rescan --user` still does.** The
service resolves the account from the attested identity, so the tool's
`NoHome` refusal narrowed to the one operation that genuinely names a home
directory: the walk over `<home>/Commands` and `<home>/Applications`. A
refusal that covers less than it did is a refusal that says something true.

## 4. Stages

Each stage ships code **plus** tests **plus** docs, leaves the whole-project
gate green (§7), and contains no stubs (§15.1).

| # | Stage | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **AD1** ✅ | Manifest publisher identity | `publisher_pubkey`/`publisher_cert` in `AppInfoHeader`; `PublisherBinding`, the two labelled preimages, and `PublisherId`; the fourth authenticity check and `PublisherId` derivation in `lib/appload`; `LoadedApp::publisher`; `APP_PUBLISHER_INVALID`; the pinned `SYSTEM_APP_PUBLISHER_SEED` and the composer's `PublisherSource`. Regenerate the C view (`cargo xtask c-header --write`). |
| **AD2** ✅ | Attested app identity | `validate_bundle_id` + `BundleId`; `AppIdentity` (whole-or-absent); `TaskCapabilities::with_app_identity`/`app_identity`; `VerifiedProgram` threading it beside the manifest request; `Origin::with_app`/`app` and its wire tail; `self_origin`/`call_peer_origin` expose it. Tests prove a caller cannot forge or inflate it, that an identity-less principal reads absent, and that a malformed or half-filled wire tail is refused. |
| **AD3** ✅ | `lib/appconf` | The format engine: parse, typed accessors, comment/unparsed-line-preserving rewrite, fixed fail-closed bounds, fuzz harness (§19.6) holding the parse/render fixed point and the one-key-per-write property. No I/O; entirely host-testable. |
| **AD4** ✅ | `confd` + private scope | The service bundle and its `confd` account/ceiling, `APPDATA_ENDPOINT` + `lib/abi/src/appdata_ipc.rs`, `CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN`, the gated `Settings/Apps` + `Library/Apps` roots with their `required_cap` inodes and search-only transit grants across all three home provisioners, the `.owner` pin, the whole-document merged read, per-process staging and atomic commit, and the §3.5 name-gate fix the gate turned out to need. |
| **AD5** ✅ | `lib/appdata` + first migration | The client: one call to open, local reads, staged writes published as one commit, the **bundle-defaults fallback layer** (§3.4), the degrade path with a typed reason, and the shared fake service every consumer's own tests drive it over. `terminal` migrated: its hand-rolled `key value` parser, renderer, document bound, error types, and `~/Settings/Terminal/terminal.conf` path **deleted**, its registry re-keyed on dotted keys, and its *Restore defaults* turned from "write today's values" into an `unset` the store answers (§3.10). |
| **AD6** ✅ | Public scope | `public.conf`; `ConfigScope { Private, Public }` on every own-store request and the reshaped `appdata-v1` header that carries it; `PublicRead` as a **separate opcode with no scope field**, so another app's private document is not a representable request; per-scope staging, per-scope commit and per-scope pending-edit bound; the one scope→file-name mapping and the derived `.new` sibling; the published scope's deliberate absence of any layer beneath it; the foreign read's audited empty answer for a target-side defect and its typed refusal for the caller's own; `Settings::open_published` and `read_published` in the client, and the fake service extended to both scopes and to foreign apps. |
| **AD7** ✅ | Secrets | `secret.vault` and the per-account `.vault-master` record; the AEAD hierarchy (`derive_key` under one labelled context, ChaCha20-Poly1305 per document, a fresh nonce per seal) and the injected `Entropy` seam; `VaultRead`/`VaultSet`/`VaultUnset` as opcodes with **no scope field and no foreign counterpart**, and writes applied before the reply rather than staged; a damaged record, a failed authentication, and absent key material as three distinct audited refusals that are never an empty vault; a malformed master record refused and **never replaced**; the wipe moved into `lib/appconf`'s own `Line::drop`; `Vault` in the client, the fake service extended to the scope, and a fuzz harness over both records. **No protector abstraction** — §3.7 records why. |
| **AD8** ✅ | Blobs | The kernel prerequisite the descriptor hand-off turned out to need (§3.8): `fd_grant` delegating the grantor descriptor's own mode with a mandatory write-extent ceiling, one resolution of *whose* authority a path-backed descriptor operation runs under, and `fs_stat`/`fs_truncate`/`fs_sync`/`file_map` gating per backing so a recipient holding no filesystem capability can use what it was given; `File::from_delegation` as the one owned redemption, replacing `viewer`'s hand-rolled pair. Then the scope itself: `validate_blob_name` over the shared store-name grammar, `BlobOpen`/`BlobDelete`/`BlobList`/`QuotaGet` with the listing whole-or-nothing and no cursor, the `Library/Apps` root resolved beside the configuration one under the same single pin, admission against the count ceiling, the client's blob surface, the fake service extended to it, and the root-cache ownership re-check AD4 left incomplete (§3.4). |
| **AD9** ✅ | Temp | `TempCreate`/`TempRelease` as opcodes carrying no scope, with the **service** naming the file so nothing can open one it did not just create; the `<boot-id>-<slot>` naming rule that makes staleness legible with no marker record, the lazy reap of an earlier boot's scratch paid by the create that needs the room, and a boot with no identity refusing the scope alone; `APPDATA_TEMP_MAX_COUNT` admission and the per-file extent ceiling shared with the blob scope; `QuotaGet` reshaped to report both bulk scopes in one answer (`BulkQuota`); `blob.rs` generalised into `bulk.rs` — one `Scope` for what the two share, `BlobStore` and `TempStore` for what they do not; `temp::create`/`temp::release`/`bulk_quota` in the client, and the fake service extended to the scope. **No session-end reap** and **no `Cache/` scope** — §3.14 records why each is a decision rather than an omission. |
| **AD10** ✅ | Remaining migrations | `fstree` on the private scope, its hand-rolled parser and `<home>/Settings/fstree/config` **deleted** and its toggles a closed registry the session loop publishes (§3.15). The pinboard on the desktop session's **published** scope: `lib/wallpaper`'s own `key = value` engine deleted, `user_settings_path` and `~/Settings/Pinboard/pinboard.conf` deleted, the chooser's unmediated read replaced by `read_published`, and `SessionFileWriter` deleted with the last file the session wrote (§3.16). The program library's per-user overlay on `applib`'s **published** scope, `lib/proglib` re-expressed as a registry over `lib/appconf` with its record ceiling derived from the format's, its `Store` seam given two backings of one shape, and the machine layer deliberately left where it is (§3.17). Plus what the three of them drove: `tairix_appconf::Lookup`, `Settings::settings`, `AppDataHost for &mut H`, and the `validate_store_name` tightening that makes every store name a legal configuration key (§3.15). |
| **AD11** ✅ | Shared closed registries | `tairix_appconf::{Registry, Live, Keys}` and `tairix_appdata::{save, clear, loaded, publish, Publication, PublishJob, Published, Refusal}`: the load, save, restore and live-edit machinery every registry repeated, written once — the terminal's `Publication` hoisted out of its crate, and the terminal, `fstree`, `sapper`, `cinder`, WinterSun's graphics choice and the desktop settings moved onto it, their loops and `sapper`/`cinder`'s hand-rolled writers deleted. A save replaces a stored value the registry refused (D848), and a program sees its last write out before it ends (D846). |

AD1 and AD2 are the foundation — nothing else can be built first, and they are
split because AD1 is tooling-and-format while AD2 is kernel-and-ABI, with
different review surfaces.

## 5. Charter amendments this plan drives

Landed as the stages that need them land, never pre-written (§3, §15.2). A
✅ names the stage that landed it.

- **§16.3** ✅ (AD4) — name `Settings/Apps/<bundle-id>/` and
  `Library/Apps/<bundle-id>/` as the app-data roots, keyed on the signed bundle
  id, reachable only through the app-data service, and say why the per-app
  directory cannot itself be the gate.
- **§16.3** ✅ (AD6) — record the two configuration scopes: a private document
  no other principal may read, and a published one any app may read through a
  request shape that cannot name the private scope, with the reason the second
  exists (§1.5).
- **§16.3** ✅ (AD7) — record the sealed scope: the app's secrets, encrypted at
  rest under a key derived per (account, app), reached by operations that carry
  no scope field and have no foreign counterpart, and with no layer beneath it.
- **§16.5** ✅ (AD4) — three changes to the bundle contract:
  `DefaultSettings/` becomes a read-only **fallback layer** rather than a
  first-launch copy (its *implementation* is AD5's); the "apps may write
  `Settings/<Name>/`" sentence becomes "apps never write their store directly"
  (§3.4); and the `AppInfo` declaration list records the two publisher fields.
  AD1 shipped those fields and this list is where §9 defers the per-field record
  to, so the charter was inaccurate until it landed.
- **§5.3** ✅ (AD4) — a capability gate guards an inode's *name* as well as its
  content (§3.5).
- **§5.2** ✅ (AD4) — add `CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN` to the capability list.
- **§3** ✅ (AD5) — the repository map gains `lib/appdata/`, the app-data
  client.
- **§15.18** ✅ (AD3, AD6, AD9) — a jump-sheet row: *"App settings, secrets,
  blobs and temporary files: the per-app store keyed on bundle id, the
  publisher pin, the `key = value` format engine, the published scope one app
  reads another's values through, the sealed scope, descriptor-backed blobs and
  per-boot scratch" → `plans/APPDATA.md`*.
- **`README.md`** ✅ (AD4, AD6, AD7, AD8, AD9) — the security/attack-vector matrix gains the
  app-from-app isolation row and the name-gate row (§13), (AD6) the row for
  cross-app sharing confined to the published scope: an app reaching another
  app's *private* settings through the sharing channel, or using it to probe
  which applications an account has run, (AD7) the row for the sealed store:
  an app reading another app's saved passwords or tokens, and a damaged or forged
  vault being read as "no secrets saved", and (AD8) two rows for the bulk scope:
  one app reading or overwriting another's blobs — or filling the volume through
  a store no per-user quota can see — and a delegated descriptor conveying more
  than its grantor opened or growing a file without limit, and (AD9) the row for
  scratch: an app reading another's temporary files, or its own from an earlier
  run, through a name it could ask for.
- **§16.3** ✅ (AD8) — record the bulk scope: `Blobs/<name>` reached as a
  bounded descriptor rather than as bytes, why the service is the only thing
  that can bound its size, and that its ceilings are §24.4 containment bounds
  rather than §24.1 capacities.
- **§16.3** ✅ (AD9) — record the temporary scope beside it: `Temp/`, named by
  the service so nothing can open a file it did not just create, reaped per
  boot, and bounded by a count of its own against the same per-file extent
  ceiling. The `Cache/` scope named in the earlier layout is removed, with the
  reason (§3.14).
- **`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6** ✅ (AD8) — record that the picker's grant is
  read-only because the picker opens a read-only descriptor, not because the
  mechanism can only be that; `fd_grant` now carries the grantor descriptor's
  own access with a mandatory extent ceiling on a writable one.
- **§3** ✅ (AD10) — the repository map's one-line summaries for
  `lib/proglib` and `lib/wallpaper` say *registry* rather than *store*: each
  now defines a closed registry over `lib/appconf` and owns no grammar.
- **§15.18** ✅ (AD10) — the pinboard jump-sheet row names the settings the
  session *publishes* rather than a per-user settings store.
- **`plans/PINBOARD.md` §2** ✅ (AD10) — the settings document's home is the
  session's published app-data scope, its grammar is `lib/appconf`'s, and the
  registry's two readings (tolerant for the store, strict for the channel) are
  recorded; `<home>/Settings/Pinboard/pinboard.conf` and
  `tairix_wallpaper::user_settings_path` are deleted.
- **`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` §4, §5, T1, T2** ✅ (AD10) — the per-user overlay's
  home is `applib`'s published app-data scope (so it needs no capability and no
  `HOME`), the machine layer stays a `/System/Settings` administrator document
  and why, and the store spellings the crate defines once are restated.

No new charter *mechanism* is added: AD10 consumes what AD4–AD9 built. The
`README.md` security matrix is unchanged for the same reason — its rows name
the store's guarantees, and this stage put the system's own remaining per-app
documents behind them rather than adding a guarantee.
