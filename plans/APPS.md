# APPS — Application structure, command help, and command resolution

This document is the normative specification for how a TAIRiX application is
**structured on disk**, how its **command-line help is authored and served**,
and how the shell (`elsh`, `plans/SHELL.md`) **resolves a typed command name**
to a runnable application. It extends — it does not replace — the fixed `.app`
bundle contract in `AGENTS.md` §16.5.

`AGENTS.md` is binding and wins over this document wherever they disagree.
This spec also defers to its companions and MUST stay consistent with them:

- **Application bundles / ABI** — `AGENTS.md` §9, §16.4, §16.5 and
  `lib/abi/src/appinfo.rs` (`BundleEntry`, `validate_bundle_layout`,
  `AppInfoHeader`) own the signed manifest, the fixed top-level layout, and the
  dynamic-loader library policy. `userland/system/appmgr` owns loading.
- **Shell** — `plans/SHELL.md` owns command parsing, builtins, job control,
  and the standard-stream model. This document adds command *resolution* and
  the `man`/`-h` help surface the shell exposes.
- **Paths / aliases** — `plans/DRIVES.md` (path spelling, `System:`/`Apps:`)
  and `plans/ALIAS.md` (resource references). No second path or reference
  parser is defined here (§2.2).
- **Terminal stack** — `plans/CURSES.md` (`lib/vt`, `lib/termcap`,
  `lib/curses`). Help rendering to a terminal goes through that one vocabulary.

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**
are implementation requirements.

- **App bundle** — a `<Name>.app` directory under a program store (§16.5).
- **Program kind** — what a bundle's manifest declares itself to be:
  `command`, `application`, or `service`. It alone decides the store the
  bundle is planted in; no list of "which programs are commands" exists.
- **Command app** — an app whose interface is the standard streams, so a
  user can run it by typing its command name at the shell.
- **System command store** — the OS-provided, read-only, system-signed set of
  command apps (`/System/Commands`), the first directory a bare word is
  resolved against (see "Command resolution").
- **System application store** — the OS-provided, read-only, system-signed
  graphical applications (`/System/Applications`), resolved second.
- **Program store** — either system store above, or a user's own
  `<home>/Commands` / `<home>/Applications` pair.
- **Help document** — one structured Markdown file describing one command
  (our modern replacement for a Unix man page).
- **Locale** — a BCP-47 language tag (e.g. `en-US`, `fr-FR`). `en-US` is
  the mandatory canonical locale every fallback chain ends at.

## Status

**In progress.** The maintainer decided the once-open design question in
favour of the **merge**: there is no separate `Documentation/` bundle entry —
the single internationalised `Help/` tree serves the CLI `man`, each
command's short `-h`/`-?` help, and any graphical help viewer (bundle-local
app documentation only; the OS source-tree docs under `docs/` are unrelated).
Landed: deliverable 1 (`BundleEntry::Help` replaced `Documentation` in place,
`AGENTS.md` §16.5 amended, C header regenerated), deliverable 2 (the
`lib/help` engine), deliverable 3 (the `man.app` command app, §7, with its
own thirteen-locale `Help/` tree shipped on the read-only `/System` volume and
the `LANG` locale variable named in §5), deliverable 4 (shell command
resolution over the `/System/Commands/` system command store, `AGENTS.md` §16.2
amended), and deliverable 6 for **every store-registered command app**:
`cat`, `ls`, `ps`, `top`, `sysinfo`, `users`, and `elsh` each ship a thirteen-locale
`Help/` tree in their bundle (discovered by `tools/syshelp` from the
`userland/apps` and `userland/shell` roots, planted by `tools/mkimage`
and the QEMU fixture) and honour the §4 `-h`/`-?` short-help convention
through the one shared `lib/help` render (`own_short_help` + the
`rt`-feature `BundleHelp` own-bundle source, which every `Run` binary
reuses instead of a private copy), deliverable 5 (`cargo xtask
help-lint`, the §8.1 gate wired into `cargo xtask ci`), and deliverable 8
increments 1–4 — self-contained on-disk bundles: every discovered
bundle's signed `AppInfo` + `Run` ships on disk beside its `Help/`, and
on the aarch64 production boot the `spawn` syscall loads and verifies
the on-disk store bundles through the shared `tairix_appload` gate (no
kernel-baked rxe rows remain there). Remaining: deliverable 7 (wider
`stdinfo` adoption — `man`'s locale-fallback, `ls`'s hidden-entries
omission, and the shared self-scope omission record `ps` and `sysinfo
processes` both emit are live; the other registered commands have
nothing non-obvious to add today), `Help/`
trees for future command apps as each becomes a registered bundle,
the §12.1 Stage B remainder (`chmod`/`chown`/`getcap`/`setcap`/`mount`
blocked on their kernel syscalls — `cp`/`mv`/`rm`/`useradd`/`groupadd`
are registered store bundles), the §12.1 Stage C remainder (the first
batch's `true`/`false`/`yes`/`basename`/`dirname`/`mkdir`/`rmdir`/
`head`/`wc`/`tee`/`seq`/`whoami` are registered store bundles; the rest
land in further batches; the networking tools `ping`, `host`, `ss` and
`telnet` are registered store bundles under their own plans), the §12.2 colour-scheme and box-drawing work
(deliverable 9), and
deliverable 8 increment 5 (the x86_64/riscv64 storage floor, then
deletion of the embedded registry those ports still carry as their
§18.6 boot floor). Help documents are authored **only** in
each bundle's
on-disk `Help/` tree and read at runtime through the `lib/help` seam — no app
embeds its help, and the image builder plants the trees from data discovered
by `tools/syshelp`, never a hand-maintained per-bundle list (§6.1, `AGENTS.md`
§16.5).

## Immediate work — kernel defects blocking further APPS stages

Four kernel defects observed on the running system MUST be fixed before the
remaining APPS deliverables continue. Each item records its root cause and
design (or landed behaviour) so any context can pick it up; all four are
now done. Statuses per `AGENTS.md` §13.

### I1. Idle load average pinned at ~1 — IPC wake-all thundering herd

**Status: done** (verify the idle load on a live single-core QEMU session
when convenient).

- **Defect:** at idle on a single-core QEMU instance the 1/5/15-minute load
  averages gravitated to 1, not ~0. Root cause: the `ipc_call` handler woke
  **every** parked IPC server (`serve_wake` → `SERVE_WAITQ.wake_all`) and
  `call_reply` woke **every** parked caller — a spuriously-woken server
  (e.g. the in-kernel driver-store kthread) was `Ready` at the instant the
  load census sampled the run queue. The `LoadTracker` maths, the observer
  exclusion, and every park path were verified correct; the herd was the
  sole cause (the `AGENTS.md` §27.3 wake-one defect).
- **Landed behaviour:** addressed IPC events wake exactly their target.
  `CallEndpoint` records the serving task's scheduler id at first receive
  (`record_server_task`, set by the `call_recv` handler and the in-kernel
  store serve loop) and each `post` captures the poster's scheduler id;
  `reply` returns it. `ipc_call` wakes only the recorded server
  (`waitq::serve_wake_task` over the new `WaitQueue::wake_task`) and every
  reply site wakes only the ticket's poster (`call_wake_task`), falling back
  to the broadcast only for an unrecorded server / id-less poster. Endpoint
  destruction keeps the broadcast so cancelled callers re-poll fail-closed.
  Covered by unit tests in `kernel/ipc/src/call.rs`
  (`reply_returns_the_posters_scheduler_id`,
  `server_task_is_recorded_once_and_zero_is_rejected`) and
  `kernel/core/src/waitq.rs`
  (`wake_task_unparks_only_the_named_registered_waiter`); the wake
  discipline is documented in `docs/src/architecture/scheduler.md`.

### I2. Process memory is never reclaimed on exit — login/logout RAM growth

**Status: done** (verify the stable login/logout RAM on a live QEMU session
when convenient), with one staged follow-up below.

- **Defect:** repeated login/logout grew used RAM monotonically: teardown
  reclaimed the kernel stack, IRQ bindings, endpoints, shared regions, and
  the capability record, but no user frames and no page-table frames.
- **Landed behaviour:** teardown is owned by the retained live space.
  `LiveSpace::drop` (`kernel/mem/src/live.rs`, run when the scheduler reap
  drops the control block's `Box<dyn LiveUserSpace>`) surrenders every live
  DMA carve to its node's quarantine (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D167), then
  releases every remaining tracked mapping — a page inside the
  MMIO/shared windows is only unmapped (device- or registry-owned frames);
  every other frame (image, user stack, startup block, anon heap) is zeroed
  through the physmap (zero-on-free, §4) and freed — and finally returns the
  page-table hierarchy post-order through the one shared
  `tairix_arch_api::frames::reclaim_hierarchy` walk each port's
  `mmu::AddressSpace::reclaim_table_frames` override drives into the new
  `PageTableFrames::free_table` (allocator-backed `FrameTableSource`
  recycles; the boot pools retire without reuse). SMP safety is an
  invariant, not luck: each port publishes a set-once **park root** (the
  permanent boot translation; aarch64/riscv64 in the boot `switch()`, x86_64
  from the trampoline `CR3` in `try_boot`), and the dispatcher re-parks a
  CPU off a user root at every task suspend
  (`KernelArch::park_translation` → `install_park_translation` →
  `dispatch_step`), so a dead root is never a CPU's active translation when
  its tables are freed (the port reclaim re-parks defensively and retires
  frames unreclaimed rather than dismantling an active regime — fail
  closed). A task that exits without a live space (kthreads) reclaims
  nothing, as before. Tests: `LiveSpace` whole-footprint drop test and the
  `spawn_image` spawn/exit-cycle test (`kernel/core/src/spawn.rs`) assert
  `free_frames` returns exactly to its pre-spawn value; aarch64/riscv64
  paging tests assert the walk returns every drawn table exactly once, root
  last, leaves never; `FrameTableSource` tests pin reuse-after-free and
  double-free refusal; a `kthread` test pins the park-at-suspend; the
  spawn/wait/session QEMU verticals (all three ports) execute the real
  teardown at every child reap. Documented in
  `docs/src/architecture/memory.md`.
- **Follow-up (done):** the numeric free-memory-stability QEMU vertical
  (`tests/integration/memsoak_qemu_aarch64`, shared with I3 below). The
  `memsoak` fixture command app (`tests/integration/memsoak_program` —
  outside the userland discovery walk, so no production image ships it;
  composed/signed by the same xtask composer and planted only on that
  vertical's `FsDisk::MemsoakRootDisk` disk) runs from the scripted root
  shell and drives warmup + 32 measured spawn/wait cycles of `true.app`
  (the full reap-and-teardown path), asserting the final
  `KernelMemoryStats.free_bytes` — read through sysinfod's
  `KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS` query under its manifest's `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` —
  equals the baseline **exactly** (the host-tested
  `tairix_test_memsoak::verdict`). On failure it prints `MEMSOAK FAIL
  baseline=… final=…` and parks forever, so the run times out fail-loud
  with the numbers in the transcript.

### I3. `top -d0` crashes the OS after ~1 h on a 180 MiB instance

**Status: done** (host reproduction green and every host-reachable layer
exonerated; the live/QEMU numeric re-test below is landed and green).

- **Defect:** a continuous-refresh `top -d0` session on a 180 MiB QEMU
  instance eventually crashed the OS; suspected out-of-memory.
- **Landed — the instrumented host reproduction.** Two standing regression
  soaks pin the cycle's memory behaviour, instrumented by the test-only
  opt-in counting allocator `kernel/core/src/test_alloc.rs` (per-measurement
  `LiveBytes` balances, immune to test parallelism):
  - `refresh_cycle_soak_retains_no_kernel_memory`
    (`kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`) drives the exact per-refresh kernel
    sequence — timed `stream_read` whose bound elapses, `ipc_call` round
    trip against a live server thread, `sysinfo_introspect` process walk —
    for thousands of iterations and asserts zero retained bytes (±1 KiB
    sampling slack) and every ticket retired.
  - `refresh_shaped_workload_reaches_a_steady_mapped_extent`
    (`lib/rt/src/heap.rs`) replays the `top`/`sysinfod` allocation shape
    (doubling-realloc record vectors, paging scratch, small boxes, mixed
    frees) against the userland heap bookkeeping and asserts the mapped
    extent reaches a steady state and fully unmaps — a heap defect here
    would drain machine frames through `mem_map` from either process.
- **Findings:** the kernel side of the cycle retains nothing per iteration,
  and the userland heap is steady under the workload. The one growth the
  soak initially caught was its own fixture: the per-round-trip
  `CallPosted`/`CallReplied` audit records are `Level::Debug` **by design**
  and the production boot's `Info` filter drops them before any sink — only
  the test-global `Trace` filter plus a recording sink retained them. With
  the earlier suspects (`top`'s model, `CallEndpoint` bookkeeping, the
  write-through sinks) this exonerates every layer reachable from the host;
  the I2 teardown leak (now fixed) remains the prime explanation if the
  session had login/exit churn.
- **Landed — the live re-test** (`memsoak_qemu_aarch64`, shared with the
  I2 follow-up above): each measured cycle replays the `top -d0` refresh
  shape on the live production boot — a timed `stream_read` whose bound
  elapses (the tickless refresh park), a self-scoped process-list walk,
  and a `KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS` IPC round trip against the real `sysinfod`
  — on top of the spawn/reap, and the strict baseline/final `free_bytes`
  equality passes on QEMU. That reaches the layers the host soaks could
  not (arch port, UART TX path, timer/IRQ plumbing), so no live decay
  remains; a regression re-fails the vertical with the numbers in the
  transcript.

### I4. Pi 4B (8 GiB) reports 863 MiB — only the first `/memory` range is used

**Status: done** (verify the reported total on the 8 GiB board when
convenient), with one staged follow-up below.

- **Defect:** on an 8 GiB Raspberry Pi 4B the reported total memory was
  863 MiB: the aarch64 boot path read only `Fdt::first_memory_region()`, so
  just the first `/memory` `reg` window (below the BCM2711 MMIO hole)
  reached the frame allocator.
- **Landed behaviour:** `lib/fdt` exposes `Fdt::each_memory_region` (every
  `reg` pair of every top-level `/memory` node, honouring the root
  `#address-cells`/`#size-cells`, fail-closed on truncated pairs);
  `first_memory_region` is derived from it. The aarch64 boot collects all
  non-zero windows, clips them out of Device-typed gigapages
  (`mem_map::clip_windows_to_normal_ram` — the identity map types memory at
  1 GiB granularity and Device wins for a shared gigapage, so RAM sharing
  the UART/GIC/PCIe gigapage is dropped fail-closed), widens the RAM
  gigapage mask and live identity map per window, and
  `mem_map::build_memory_map` lays out N windows (kernel reserve + guard
  arena in the kernel's window, sized from *total* RAM; every other window
  wholly usable). Host tests cover the Pi 4-shaped multi-window/clip cases
  in `lib/fdt` and `mem_map`; `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` describes the
  behaviour. On the 8 GiB board the reported total should now be ≈7 GiB.
- **Follow-up (staged):** reclaim the RAM clipped out of the Device-typed
  gigapage (~1 GiB on a Pi 4: `0xC000_0000..0xFC00_0000`) by typing the
  identity map at 2 MiB granularity inside a mixed gigapage; and adopt the
  all-ranges iterator in the riscv64 boot map builder
  (`riscv64::boot::build_boot_memory_map` still reads the first window —
  QEMU `virt` declares one, so nothing is currently lost there).

## 1. Everything is a bundle — including single-binary utilities

TAIRiX does **not** organise programs the Unix way: there is no `/usr/bin/<app>`
flat binary directory and no `man`-page directory in a separate tree
(`AGENTS.md` §16.1 forbids the legacy top-level names). Every program the user
can run — from a large graphical application down to a one-file utility like
`ps`, `top`, or `cat` — is an **application bundle**, a `<Name>.app` directory
whose fixed layout §16.5 defines.

A small single-binary utility is a perfectly good bundle: it has an `AppInfo`
manifest and a `Run` binary and little else. Keeping such tools as single
binaries inside a bundle is deliberate and is preserved — the bundle is the
*organisational* unit, not a demand that every tool grow extra machinery. The
same bundle shape scales up: a larger app adds `Code/`, `Libraries/`,
`Resources/`, and the internationalised `Help/` tree described below.

This applies to every present and future command-line program. A new CLI tool
is added as its own `<Name>.app` bundle (§16.5), never as a loose binary in a
shared directory, and it ships its own icon inside that bundle (§14 —
mandatory, for graphical apps and text tools alike).

### 1.1 Command surface follows GNU coreutils (`AGENTS.md` §16.7)

The OS-provided command apps (`ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `ps`, `top`, …)
MUST match **GNU coreutils** option names, argument grammar, and default
output as closely as possible (`AGENTS.md` §16.7): a user or script that knows
the GNU tool finds ours familiar, and any deviation carries the burden of
proof. TAIRiX-native concepts diverge deliberately and only where they
genuinely differ — capabilities (§5.2) instead of `setuid`, the storage forest
(§16.1) instead of Unix single-root paths, `Time64` (§21) timestamps, and the
System Information API (§16.6) instead of a fabricated `/proc`. The `stdinfo`
stream (§12, `AGENTS.md` §20) is **additive** on fd 3: a tool emits its
structured advisory records there in addition to its coreutils-compatible
stdout/stderr, never by reshaping stdout. Security and correctness (§5.4, §4)
win over bug-for-bug fidelity. The per-command option/output specifications
this document adds MUST honour §16.7.

### 1.2 Output is streamed, never accumulated

A command app's output size is unbounded: `ls -lsR /` can legitimately emit
gigabytes of listing, and on a filesystem that permits unbounded depth the
traversal never ends at all. A "store then send" design — collecting the whole
result in a growable buffer and writing it at the end — therefore overflows or
exhausts memory on exactly the inputs a real system produces (`AGENTS.md`
§26.3), and is a defect regardless of how well it behaves on small trees.

- **Stream by default.** A command app writes each unit of output (a line, an
  entry, a chunk) to `stdout` as it is produced and moves on, holding only
  bounded working state. Memory use is a function of the *working set* (the
  current entry, the current directory), never of the total output size
  (`AGENTS.md` §2.16, §24.1). Streaming is preferred because it always works:
  it is correct at any output size, lets a pipe consumer see output
  immediately, and lets stream back-pressure pace the producer.
- **Buffer only what the format itself demands, and bound it.** Some GNU
  output formats genuinely need look-ahead — `ls`'s column auto-sizing needs
  one directory's entries, `df`'s auto-sized columns need the mount table,
  `head -n -N` needs a last-N queue. Such state is bounded to the smallest
  unit the format requires (one directory, one table, N lines — never the
  whole recursive traversal) and the bounded shape is deliberate, as `head`'s
  constant-memory ring and line queue already demonstrate (§12.1 Stage C).
  A format need is never an excuse to accumulate the full output.
- **Exhaustion still fails closed.** Where bounded working state can still hit
  a genuine out-of-memory condition, the tool reports the typed error and
  fails loud (`AGENTS.md` §2.9, §2.24) — it never panics or silently truncates
  output.

## 2. Bundle layout (per §16.5)

The fixed top-level layout of `AGENTS.md` §16.5 carries one documentation
entry, `Help/` (the former `Documentation/`, merged into it):

```
/System/Commands/top.app/        # (or /Apps/Example.app for installed apps)
├── AppInfo            # Signed manifest. Required.
├── Run                # Entry-point rxe binary. Required.
├── Code/              # Additional rxe binaries / plugins.
├── Libraries/         # Private shared libraries used only by this app.
├── Resources/         # Images, locales, UI definitions, etc.
├── DefaultSettings/   # Read-only defaults: a fallback layer, never copied.
└── Help/              # Internationalised Markdown help (this doc).
```

`Resources/` carries, among the bundle's other authored data, the one asset
every launchable app MUST ship: its own icon, named by the manifest (§14).

### 2.0 The manifest's two names

`AppInfo` declares the program's **name** and its **title**, and they answer
different questions:

- `name` is the command word. It is the stem of the `<Name>.app` directory,
  what the shell resolves (§8), and what `man` looks a bundle's help up by, so
  it is held to a plain-word grammar and is never prose.
- `title` is the human-readable name, the one §16.5 requires a manifest to
  declare. Every surface that names the application *to a user* draws it — the
  icon-bar slot label, the application menu's plate title, the information
  panel, the program-library row, the "Open With…" candidate list. A bundle
  that declares no title is titled by its command word, so an absent title
  means "the word reads well enough" rather than a blank label.

Nothing functional reads `title` and nothing shown to a user reads `name`. The
two were one field, which is why the icon bar's menu was headed `sapper`:
capitalising the manifest's `name` was not available, because that string is
also a directory and a command.

`Help/` is the bundle's **only** documentation mechanism — one
internationalised, structured-Markdown tree, so there is no second,
overlapping documentation entry to double-maintain (§2.2, §2.3). It is the
modern replacement for Unix man pages and the single source the CLI `man`
command (§7), each command's short `-h`/`-?` help (§4), and any graphical
help viewer read from. A bundle that ships longer-form material (a guide, a
tutorial) ships it as additional named *topics* in the same tree (§2.1),
rendered by the same engine.

Because `abi-v1` is not frozen (§9), the merge was a straightforward in-place
evolution (§2.13), and it has landed: `BundleEntry::Help` replaced
`Documentation` (`lib/abi/src/appinfo.rs`), `validate_bundle_layout` accepts
exactly the new set, every caller and fixture was updated in the same change,
and the generated C header carries `TAIRIX_BUNDLE_ENTRY_HELP`.

The permitted top-level entry names remain a closed, case-sensitive set
validated by `validate_bundle_layout`: any entry outside the set still fails
the whole bundle closed (§5.4). `Help/` is a directory and is **optional** — a
bundle with no help still loads — but every OS-provided command app MUST ship
a `Help/` tree (§8 content policy).

### 2.1 The `Help/` locale tree

`Help/` contains one subdirectory per locale, of which the canonical
`en-US/` is mandatory:

```
top.app/Help/
├── en-US/             # The canonical source; MUST exist.
│   ├── top.md         # one Help document per command/topic
│   └── ...
├── fr-FR/
├── de-DE/
├── es-ES/
├── uk-UA/
├── it-IT/
├── pt-PT/
├── cy-GB/
├── zh-CN/
├── ja-JP/
├── ko-KR/
├── ar-SA/
└── he-IL/
```

- `en-US/` is the canonical help. It MUST exist for any bundle that ships
  `Help/`; a `Help/` tree without `en-US/` is a packaging defect and the
  loader/help engine fails closed (§5.4, §2.9).
- Each other directory is named by an exact BCP-47 tag and holds the same set
  of document file names as `en-US/`, translated.
- A locale directory MAY omit documents it has not translated yet; the help
  engine falls back per §5. It MUST NOT contain a document name absent from
  `en-US/` (there is nothing to fall back *from*, and it signals drift).
- One Help document describes one command or topic. A bundle whose `Run` (and
  `Code/`) expose several command names ships one document per command name,
  named `<command>.md`. The document for the bundle's primary command shares
  the command name (e.g. `top.md`).

## 3. Help document format

A Help document is a single UTF-8 Markdown file with a fixed, ordered set of
level-2 (`##`) sections. The section *keys* are language-neutral and fixed; the
prose under them is localised. This is what lets the help engine extract a
short synopsis for `-h` from the same file `man` renders in full, in any
language, without a per-language parser (§2.2).

Required and optional sections, in order:

| Section       | Required | Purpose                                            |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `NAME`        | yes      | Command name + one-line summary.                   |
| `SYNOPSIS`    | yes      | Usage line(s); option/argument grammar.            |
| `DESCRIPTION` | yes      | Full behaviour (the `man` body).                   |
| `OPTIONS`     | if any   | One entry per command-line switch (see below).     |
| `EXAMPLES`    | no       | Worked examples.                                   |
| `EXIT STATUS` | no       | Meaning of exit codes.                             |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | no       | Environment variables consulted.                   |
| `SEE ALSO`    | no       | Related commands (by command name).                |

Section keys are written in the document verbatim (`## NAME`), never
translated, so the engine locates sections structurally. Only the content is
localised.

### 3.1 Command switches are language-neutral

A command's **switches never change with the locale.** `top -d 0` is spelled
`top -d 0` in every language; `-d`, `-h`, `-?` are properties of the program's
argument parser, not of the help text. The `OPTIONS` section therefore records,
per switch, a language-neutral **key** (the literal flag, e.g. `-d`,
`--delay`) followed by localised description prose:

```markdown
## OPTIONS

- `-d, --delay <seconds>` — <localised description of the delay option>
- `-h, -?` — <localised description: show short help>
```

The flag tokens inside backticks are the single source of truth for the
switch spelling and MUST match the app's argument parser exactly. A CI check
(§8) verifies that every switch the program accepts appears in `en-US/`'s
`OPTIONS`, and vice-versa, so help and code cannot drift (§2.14, §2.18).

## 4. Two help surfaces: short (`-h`/`-?`) and full (`man`)

There are two ways to read a command app's help, both served from the one
`Help/` tree by the one help engine (§6):

- **Short help — `<cmd> -h` or `<cmd> -?`.** The program prints a concise,
  localised usage summary to `stdout`: the `NAME` and `SYNOPSIS`, plus the
  `OPTIONS` list rendered compactly. It fits a screen and is meant for "what
  are the flags again?". It exits `0`. `-h`/`-?` are reserved command switches
  every command app SHOULD accept; a program that defines no other meaning for
  them MUST treat them as short-help.
- **Full help — `man <cmd>`.** The `man` command app (§7) renders the whole
  Help document — every section — to the terminal with Markdown richness
  (headings, emphasis, lists, tables, code blocks), paged like the historical
  `man`, but from Markdown, in the user's locale.

Both surfaces select the same document for the same command; they differ only
in how much of it they render. Neither invents help text: if a section is
absent, it is simply not shown (§2.9, no fabrication).

## 5. Locale selection and fallback

The active locale is resolved once, by the session/shell, from the user's
language preference (a per-user setting under `/Users/<u>/Settings/`, surfaced
to programs as the **`LANG` environment variable**, a BCP-47 tag such as
`fr-FR` — the shell's existing `export` mechanism, `plans/SHELL.md`).
Programs and the help engine MUST NOT invent a second locale source. A
missing or malformed `LANG` selects the canonical `en-US/` documents: a
bad preference degrades to English, it never makes help unreadable.

Given a requested locale `ll-CC`, the help engine selects a document by the
first hit in this fixed, fail-safe chain:

1. `Help/ll-CC/<cmd>.md` — exact locale.
2. `Help/ll/<any-CC>/<cmd>.md` — same language, any region (deterministic:
   the lexicographically first matching directory, so the choice is stable).
3. `Help/en-US/<cmd>.md` — the canonical document.

If even `en-US/<cmd>.md` is absent, the engine reports "no help for `<cmd>`"
as an ordinary, non-fatal result (a clean message + non-zero status), never a
crash (§2.9). Falling back never mixes languages *within* a document: a
document is rendered whole from a single file.

## 6. The help engine — `lib/help`

There is exactly one help engine, the shared crate `lib/help` (`tairix-help`),
so `man`, every command app's `-h`, and any graphical help viewer share one
implementation (§2.2). Adding it updates `AGENTS.md` §3 and this plan (§6, §16.4
list) per the `lib/*` rules (§6).

`lib/help` is `no_std` + `alloc`, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and contains no
`unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` on any path (§2.9). It:

- Locates a bundle's `Help/` tree and applies the §5 selection chain over an
  injected read-only file seam (it performs no ambient I/O; the caller supplies
  the capability-scoped reader, mirroring `appmgr`'s `BundleStore`).
- Parses the structured Markdown into the fixed §3 section model with **hard,
  fixed security bounds** (maximum document size, section count, nesting depth,
  line length, table size) that fail closed on violation (§24.4, §19.5). These
  are validation *bounds*, not growable capacities (§24.4).
- Extracts the short-help view (`NAME` + `SYNOPSIS` + compact `OPTIONS`) and
  renders the full view to the terminal through the `plans/CURSES.md` stack
  (`lib/vt`/`lib/curses`) — never a second escape-sequence vocabulary (§2.2).
- Treats help content as untrusted enough to be bounded and total even though
  it is signed (a malformed or hostile document degrades to a clean error, it
  never escapes its bounds), and ships a fuzz harness for the Markdown parser
  (§19.6).

`lib/help` is an internal building block, so it is linked **statically** by its
consumers (§16.4) — it is not one of the curated `/System/Libraries/` classes.

### 6.1 Help is authored once in the bundle — never embedded, never hand-listed

Help documents are **data on the volume**, not constants in a program. A
command's help lives in exactly one place — the bundle's own on-disk
`Help/<locale>/<doc>.md` files — and is read at runtime through the injected
`lib/help` `HelpSource` seam, from the running bundle's own `Help/` tree only.
This is binding under `AGENTS.md` §16.5:

- **No program embeds its own help.** A command app MUST NOT `include_str!` /
  `include_bytes!` its `Help/` tree into the `Run`/`Code/` binary, bake help
  strings into the program, or keep any second copy of a document outside the
  bundle. Short `-h`/`-?` help (§4) and `man` (§7) both read the same on-disk
  tree through the seam; the `Run` binary carries no help bytes of its own. A
  hand-written `help.rs` that embeds the documents is the defect this forbids.
- **The image builder discovers help, it does not list it.** The `Help/` trees
  are planted onto `/System/<store>/<name>.app/Help/` by `tools/mkimage` (and the
  QEMU image fixtures) from data discovered at build time by `tools/syshelp`,
  which scans the command-app bundles' own on-disk `Help/` sources. Adding a
  command app's help is dropping its `Help/` files under
  `userland/apps/<name>/Help/<locale>/`; the next build rediscovers them. No
  per-bundle list exists in the image builder, a fixture, or the kernel that a
  new bundle would force an edit to — that list would be the duplication §2.2
  forbids. `tools/syshelp` also fails closed on a document that does not parse
  under `lib/help`'s bounds or a bundle missing a required locale, so a
  malformed or partially-translated tree never reaches an image.
- **Internationalisation is the shared engine's job.** Locale fallback (§5) is
  the one `lib/help` chain (exact tag → same language any region → the
  canonical `en-US/`); a missing translation degrades to `en-US/`, never to
  fabricated or hardcoded text (§2.9).

## 7. The `man` command

`man` still exists, but it is TAIRiX'ised: it does **not** read the historical
troff/roff man format (TAIRiX ships none), it renders the `Help/` Markdown.

- `man` is itself a command app, `man.app`, in the system command store (§8) — it
  is not a shell builtin (it needs no shell-process state, `plans/SHELL.md`).
- `man <cmd>` resolves `<cmd>` through the **same** command-resolution path the
  shell uses (§9) to find the owning bundle, then renders that bundle's Help
  document for `<cmd>` in the active locale (§5) through `lib/help`.
- When the ordered candidates (§8) find nothing for a bare word, `man` falls
  back to a **recursive bundle search** of the stores that may nest bundles:
  the machine-wide `/Apps`, then the user's own `<HOME>/Commands` and
  `<HOME>/Applications` (`tairix_cmdres::search_roots` — the roots are
  spelled once, over `tairix_abi::INSTALLED_APP_STORE` and the home store
  names). The two system stores are absent by design: they are flat, so the
  ordered candidates already cover them. The walk is breadth-first over sorted
  listings, so the shallowest match wins deterministically; it never
  descends into another bundle's `.app` directory (a bundle is a sealed
  unit); a missing root or directory lists nothing while any other refusal
  is final; and it is bounded (depth and a whole-invocation directory
  budget) — an exhausted budget is reported as a truncated search, never
  silently as "command not found". `man moose` therefore finds
  `/Apps/somefolder/anotherfolder/moose.app` or
  `/Users/<u>/Commands/somefolder/moose.app`. This search is `man`'s only:
  the shell's *launch* resolution (§8) is unchanged.
- `man <cmd> <topic>` selects `Help/<locale>/<topic>.md` within `<cmd>`'s
  bundle, for bundles that ship more than one topic.
- `man` emits a `stdinfo` `omission`/`context` record (fd 3, §20) when it falls
  back to a non-requested locale or to the canonical `en-US`, so a tool or
  user knows the page was not shown in the requested language. This never
  affects `man`'s exit status or output correctness (§20).

## 8. Command resolution — the fixed store prefix, then the user `PATH`

Core/system command apps (`top`, `ps`, `ls`, `elsh`, `man`, …) MUST be
reachable simply by typing their command name, and so must a graphical
application (`files`, `terminal`, …). The shell resolves a bare command word
(after builtins, functions, and command aliases, per `plans/SHELL.md`) against
a **fixed, non-overridable four-directory prefix**, then the user's `PATH`
(`AGENTS.md` §16.8):

1. **`/System/Commands`** — the system command store: the OS-provided command
   apps, each a command-named bundle. Always first.
2. **`/System/Applications`** — the system application store: the OS-provided
   graphical applications, so a desktop application is typeable too.
3. **`<home>/Commands`** — the user's own command store.
4. **`<home>/Applications`** — the user's own application store.
5. **User `PATH`** — the colon-separated directories in the shell's `PATH`
   environment variable (set by `export PATH=…` or a `.profile` in the user's
   home root), searched left to right.

The prefix is *built from the store definitions in `lib/abi`*
(`SYSTEM_COMMAND_STORE`, `SYSTEM_APPLICATION_STORE`,
`HOME_COMMAND_STORE_DIR`, `HOME_APPLICATION_STORE_DIR`, `BUNDLE_SUFFIX`),
never read from the environment. Two consequences are load-bearing:

- **Nothing a user controls can shadow a system program.** Both system stores
  are read-only and system-signed and precede every user-writable directory,
  and no `PATH` value, exported variable, or per-user directory can reorder or
  remove an entry. A `PATH` entry that repeats a prefix directory is dropped
  rather than searched again, so late `PATH` text cannot read as moving a
  store later in the order. This is a security property, not a convenience.
- **A session needs no `PATH` at all.** With neither `HOME` nor `PATH` set,
  every system program still resolves. A login session's default `PATH` is
  therefore only what is genuinely additional (`/Apps`); repeating a store
  that is already built in would be duplication and would imply, falsely,
  that the store is overridable.

Steps 3 and 4 are spelled unconditionally whenever `HOME` is set: a store a
user never created simply matches nothing and the search moves on — existence
is an I/O question for the host, never a spelling one. Because an alias path
itself contains a `:` (`Home:/tools`), the `PATH` split is structural and
deterministic: a `:` immediately followed by `/` whose preceding text (since
the previous separator) is a non-empty name containing no `/` is that entry's
alias delimiter, not a separator — so an alias root entry is written `Home:/`,
never a bare `Home:`. An empty entry is skipped (never a silent
current-directory search). Each entry is resolved through the single shared
path parser (`plans/DRIVES.md`), and every candidate is a `<word>.app` bundle
launched through `appmgr` (signature + capability + interface-hash checks,
`AGENTS.md` §16.5) — never a raw loose binary (§1).

The candidate *policy* is one pure, exhaustively-tested function,
`tairix_cmdres::resolution_candidates` (`lib/cmdres`, the shared crate whose
`bundle_candidates` view the `man` command's bundle lookup imports — one
policy, two views), taking the session's `CommandEnv { home, path_var }`:
it computes only the ordered spelling list and grants nothing. The shell's
`Run` host attempts the candidates in order — the kernel's byte-exact
`spawn` lookup answering `NotFound` moves to the next candidate (a
deterministic first-match search, nothing ran), any other refusal is final
— and the kernel authorises every launch.

Which store a shipped bundle lands in is decided by its own signed manifest's
declared kind (`tairix_abi::ProgramKind`: `command`, `application`, or
`service`) and nothing else; the build refuses two bundles claiming one name,
so one store cannot shadow a name in another. Machine-wide *installed*
application bundles live in `/Apps` (`AGENTS.md` §16.3) and are launched by
the desktop/`appmgr`; they reach the shell command path only if the user adds
`/Apps` (or a bundle path) to `PATH`.

Resolution is deterministic and fails closed: an unresolved name is
`command not found` (`127`), and a resolved-but-non-executable bundle is
`command not executable` (`126`), matching `plans/SHELL.md`'s failure model
(implemented: the interpreter maps a launch `NotFound` onto `127` and every
other refusal onto `126`). No "try everything until one runs" behaviour
(§2.1).

### 8.1 Content and translation policy for OS help

- **Every OS-provided command app MUST ship a complete `Help/` tree**: an
  `en-US/` canonical document for every command it exposes, plus translations
  for the standing required locale set: `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `uk-UA`,
  `it-IT`, `pt-PT`, `cy-GB`, `zh-CN`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `ar-SA`, `he-IL`
  (the one definition is `tairix_help::REQUIRED_LOCALES`; every consumer —
  the lint and each app's own switch pins — imports it, never a private
  copy). The set gates *authoring* completeness only: runtime selection
  scans the bundle's `Help/` tree for whatever locales it actually ships
  (§5), so a third-party bundle with only `en-US/` still serves help.
  These documents MUST be generated and kept current; when an AI or a
  contributor changes a command's behaviour or switches, it updates the
  `en-US/` document and the translations in the same change (§2.8, §2.14,
  §2.18). Adding a language to the required set is data (a new locale
  directory), not new code.
- **No foul or derogatory content.** Help documents (all locales) MUST NOT
  contain profane, obscene, harassing, discriminatory, or otherwise derogatory
  language. This is a hard rule for generated and human-authored content alike.
- **Enforced in CI.** A `cargo xtask help-lint` check (run within
  `cargo xtask ci`, §7) fails closed when, for any OS command app: `en-US/`
  is missing or incomplete; a required-locale document is missing; the
  `OPTIONS` switch keys do not match the program's actual argument parser
  (§3.1); a document violates the `lib/help` structural bounds (§6); or a
  content-policy word-list/heuristic flags disallowed language. A lint failure
  is a defect fixed in the same change (§2.18), never waved through.

## 9. Invocation: `top` and `top.app`, and executability

A command app is runnable **both** by its bare command name and by its bundle
name:

- `top` — the command name; resolved per §8.
- `top.app` — the bundle name; the shell recognises a trailing `.app` on a
  command word, resolves the bundle directly, and runs it identically.

Both forms run the same `Run` binary through `appmgr` and are subject to the
identical signature and capability checks (§16.5); the `.app` spelling is a
convenience, never a privileged bypass (§5.4).

### 9.1 The manifest gates executability

Whether a bundle is a command app at all is decided by its **signed
`AppInfo` manifest**, not by its file name. A bundle is executable as a command
only if its manifest declares a runnable entry point and the launching user's
grants intersect the manifest's requested capabilities to a non-empty, valid
set (§16.5, §5.2). A bundle that declares itself non-executable (a
resource-only bundle, §10) is refused as a command (`126`) even if a user types
its name or `<name>.app`.

## 10. Resource-only ("shared-resources") bundles

A bundle MAY declare in its manifest that it is **resource-only**: it has no
runnable command entry point and exists to hold shared *data* (fonts, icons,
locale packs, templates, help topics) for a family of apps from one publisher.
Such a bundle still carries and enforces every §16.5 security guarantee: it is
signed, its layout is validated, and access to its contents is
capability-gated (§5.4). Attempting to *execute* it fails closed (§9.1).

**What a resource-only bundle MUST NOT do: provide shared dynamically-linked
libraries to *other* bundles.** `AGENTS.md` §16.4 is explicit and binding: the
dynamic loader refuses any shared-library reference outside the requesting
app's own `Libraries/` or the curated `/System/Libraries/`. A
"shared-resources.app" that other apps dynamically link against for **code** is
therefore not permitted, and the loader fails such a reference closed — this
spec does not carve an exception, because §16.4 wins (§2.13 forbids adding a
compatibility seam around it).

The compliant ways a single publisher shares code across their own apps are:

1. **Vendor the library into each app's own `Libraries/`** (statically, or as a
   bundle-private dynamic library the loader already permits, §16.4). One
   security update per app; the publisher rebuilds and re-signs.
2. **Promote the code to a curated `/System/Libraries/` class**, if and only if
   it genuinely belongs to one of that closed set (§16.4) — which requires an
   `AGENTS.md` §16.4 amendment and is an OS decision, not a third-party one.

Shared **data** (not code) is what a resource-only bundle legitimately
provides, reached through capability-gated file access (a manifest-declared or
user-mediated file capability, §16.5), never through the dynamic loader.

## 10.1 One instance per user is the default

A user launching an application they already have running gets **that**
instance asked to open, not a second process. The declaration is a manifest
key, `instances = "single" | "multiple"`, carried in the signed
`AppInfoHeader` as `APPINFO_FLAG_MULTI_INSTANCE` — in the *signed* manifest
for the same reason the icon-bar opt-out is, so a running process cannot
change how many of itself may exist. Absent means `single`.

Only the desktop's launch gate reads it, so a command app declares nothing:
the shell starts a process per invocation as it always has.

The desktop resolves every launch through one funnel
(`tairix_desktop_session::resolve_launch`): no live instance spawns without
the manifest even being read; a live singleton is handed the launch's **open
target** if it named one, else asked for its **icon-bar default** action, else
has its most recent window **raised**; and an instance that cannot be reached
at all is spawned as before, so a launch never silently does nothing.

A launch that names a target is **all-or-nothing**: the target is its one
route, and an instance that will not take it spawns instead — a fresh process
is given the same target, so it still shows what the user asked for, whereas
asking for a bare window would raise an empty one and lose the target. The
default and the raise are what a launch naming *nothing* resolves to.

The funnel is reachable by a launcher that is **not** the desktop, through
`WindowRequest::HandOverLaunch` → `Reached` / `NotRunning`. Without it a file
manager that spawns a viewer per document bypasses the funnel entirely and a
bundle declaring one instance gets several. The live instance is resolved from
the **resident** icon-bar slot — the bundle each slot-holder was launched from,
which the strip already records for its icons — so an application that declared
no icon-bar presence is not resident and is not found, the same reason a bare
launch cannot ask it for its default action.

A relaunch that names something reaches the instance as a **wake plus a
pull** — `WindowEvent::OpenRequested` then `WindowRequest::TakeOpenTarget` —
because an event frame is fixed-width and a path is far wider than one. Both
are **application**-scoped: the instance a hand-over most needs to reach is the
one with nothing open, so a window-scoped wake would leave a resident
application unreachable, and the pull names nothing because the queue is the
calling application's, whose identity the kernel attests.

**The open conflict is resolved: a target is a path *or* a document.**
`view.app` requests no filesystem capability by design
(`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6), so a *path* is not something it can open. A
`Document` target carries a one-shot delegation instead, and that is what
reaches it. The authority is relayed, never lent: the grant arrives minted by
the *asking* process to the session, from a descriptor that process opened
itself, and the session redeems it and hands the same authority on — the kernel
copies the **first** grantor's captured identity onto the onward delegation
rather than re-capturing it, so the document is read under the authority of
whoever opened it and never the session's own larger reach. There is
deliberately no way to ask the session to open a path on an application's
behalf. A path confers no access as before: the application opens it under its
own authority, exactly as it would an argument.

## 11. Security summary

Every mechanism here obeys the charter's fail-closed, least-authority model:

- **Signed, verified, capability-gated launch.** Resolving and running a
  command app — from the store or `PATH`, as `top` or `top.app` — always goes
  through `appmgr`'s signature, content-hash, interface-hash, and capability
  intersection checks (§16.5, §5.2). No path bypasses them.
- **System store precedes `PATH`.** A user cannot shadow a system command
  (§8).
- **Help content is bounded and total.** `lib/help` parses Markdown under fixed
  security bounds and never crashes on malformed input, with a fuzz harness
  (§6, §19.5, §19.6).
- **No ambient authority.** `lib/help` and `man` perform I/O only through
  injected, capability-scoped seams; help never reads outside the target
  bundle's `Help/` tree (§4, §5.4).
- **No fabricated content.** Missing sections/documents/locales degrade to
  clean messages, never invented text (§2.9).

## 12. Structured advisory output (`stdinfo`, fd 3)

Command apps SHOULD support the standard information stream (`stdinfo`, fd 3,
`AGENTS.md` §20 / §20.1) **wherever it is meaningful**. Whenever a command
hides, filters, truncates, or summarises its primary `stdout`, or when concise
non-obvious context would help a human or an AI/tool interpret the output, it
SHOULD emit the appropriate framed `StdInfoRecord` (`lib/abi/src/stdinfo.rs`,
via the `lib/rt` `stdinfo` wrapper — never a device syscall, §20) using one of
the closed canonical `kind` values (`omission`, `summary`, `schema`,
`suggestion`, `context`). It is optional and ignorable by construction:

- `stdinfo` is **advisory only** and MUST NOT affect correctness, exit status,
  scripting semantics, or pipeline behaviour (§20.1). A `stdinfo` write
  failure never changes `$?` (`plans/SHELL.md`).
- It is emitted best-effort and non-blocking when no consumer is attached
  (§20.1); a program with no fd 3 attached simply proceeds.
- The help surfaces here already use it: the `man` command emits an
  `omission`/`context` record on a locale fallback (§7), and a command's
  short help (§4) MAY note omitted detail the same way.
- Records MUST stay terse, actionable, and free of the content §20.1 forbids
  (progress spam, secrets, capability tokens, security/audit events — those go
  to `lib/log`, §19.4 — or instructions to AI agents). Consumers treat
  `stdinfo` as untrusted data about the command, never as authority (§20.1).

Where a command has nothing non-obvious to add, it emits nothing: `stdinfo` is
a channel for *useful* advisory metadata, not a requirement to speak on every
invocation.

## 12.1 GNU coreutils parity — staged plan (§1.1 / `AGENTS.md` §16.7)

The maintainer-approved staging that brings every `/System/Commands` command to
the GNU coreutils surface and fills in the missing commands. Each stage is
one properly-gated change; a stage's switch set is bounded by what the
platform floor can honestly implement (userland `FileStat` now carries
`NodeTimes` — four `Time64` stamps — as well as kind/size/mode/uid/gid, but
the VFS now has both symbolic and hard links, so the link-dependent
behaviour Stage E stages is what remains of the *command* surface, not the
platform floor).

- **Stage A — GNU switches for the existing tools (done).** On the current
  floor: `cat` `-A -b -e -E -n -s -t -T -u -v` (bundled short flags, GNU
  `^`/`M-` notation); `ls` `-a -A -b -B -C -d -F -f -g -G -h -i -I -k -l -m -N -n -o -p -Q -q -r -R -s -S -t -T -u -U -v -w -x -X -1 --sort --group-directories-first --quoting-style --show-control-chars --ignore --hide --si --author --file-type --block-size --format --indicator-style --time --time-style --full-time --inode --no-group --kibibytes --tabsize --zero`
  (`-h` takes the GNU human-readable meaning — short help is `-?`/`--help` —
  and the invented `--long` synonym is retired; long format shows numeric
  owner/group, the GNU numeric fallback, beside the link count the
  filesystem records; the sort
  key is name by default, `-S` size, `-t` time, `-X` extension, `-v` natural
  version order (a faithful `filevercmp` port), `-U`/`-f` no sort (directory
  order, `-f` also enabling `-a` and disabling `-l`/`-s`), or `--sort=WORD`
  by name, with `--group-directories-first` floating directories to the top
  regardless of `-r`; the
  default arrangement is GNU's
  multi-column — `-C` down, `-x` across, `-m` comma-wrapped, `-1` one per
  line, `-w`/`--width` overriding the width — when stdout is an attested
  console, decided against the kernel's fail-closed geometry attestation
  and falling back to one-per-line otherwise, cell widths measured
  through the shared `tairix_vt::str_width` table; names are quoted by a
  faithful GNU `quotearg` port — `-N` literal, `-Q` C, `-b` escape, and
  `--quoting-style` selecting the full `literal`/`shell`/`shell-always`/
  `shell-escape`/`shell-escape-always`/`c`/`escape` set (`locale`/`clocale`
  refused, fail closed, like `--time-style=+FORMAT`), defaulting to
  `shell-escape` at an attested terminal and `literal` otherwise, with
  `-q`/`--show-control-chars` toggling the `?` control-char masking);
  name filters follow GNU's `file_ignored` order — `-B`/`--ignore-backups`
  drops names ending in `~` in every mode (a direct suffix test, not a
  glob), `-I`/`--ignore=PATTERN` (repeatable) drops matches in every
  mode, and `--hide=PATTERN` (repeatable) drops matches only when neither
  `-a` nor `-A` is given, all compiled through the shared, fail-closed
  `lib/glob` matcher (a malformed pattern is a usage error) and applied
  silently — an explicit filter is never advertised on the omission stream;
  size scaling is the GNU two-setting model — `-h` (base 1024) / `--si`
  (base 1000) / `--block-size=SIZE` scale both the long file-size column
  and the `-s` blocks, while `-k`/`--kibibytes` forces 1024-byte blocks for
  `-s`/`total` only (already the default, no `BLOCK_SIZE` env, so it
  confirms rather than changes; a size option overrides it), with the total
  scaling the summed allocation not the sum of the rounded cells; the SIZE
  grammar is GNU's (integer coefficient + `K`/`KiB`/`KB`… unit, suffix
  printed only for a bare unit, malformed fails closed); `--format=WORD`
  and `-l`/`-1`/`-C`/`-x`/`-m` are one last-wins arrangement state (with
  GNU's `-1`-no-effect-after-`-l` rule), `--indicator-style=WORD` /
  `--file-type` extend `-p`/`-F` (with only dir/regular kinds, `file-type`
  appends `/` and never `*`), `-G`/`--no-group` drops the group column
  without selecting `-l`, `--author` repeats the owner column, `-T`/
  `--tabsize` (default 8, `0` = spaces) advances columns with tabs by a
  faithful port of GNU's `indent`, and `--zero` NUL-terminates entry lines
  and the `total` (headers/separators keep the newline), defaulting to
  single-column + literal + shown control chars;
  `rm` `-d -f -i -I -r -v
  --preserve-root`/`--no-preserve-root` (prompt seam, GNU `removed …`
  wording); `cp` `-f -i -n -r -t -T -v`; `mv` `-f -i -n -t -T -v`
  (`-f`/`-i`/`-n` last-wins, `renamed 'a' -> 'b'` wording); `chmod` and
  `chown` `-c -f -v` (GNU changed/retained wording; `-f` suppresses
  per-operand diagnostics, continues, and still fails the run via the
  message-less `Silenced` error). Each tool's `Prompt`/`Output` seams stay
  injected and fail closed; registered tools' thirteen-locale `Help/` trees and
  the switch-drift pins are current.
- **Stage B — register the orphan utilities as store bundles (in
  progress).** Each orphan gains `AppInfo.toml`/`Run`/`Help/` (the §8.1
  required locales) and store registration per §16.5/§6.1, wiring the `Prompt`
  seam to stderr+stdin (`y`/`Y` affirmative; end-of-input is a decline,
  never consent) in each `Run` host. **Done: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`** — each is
  a full self-contained store bundle (console pair + `CAP_FS_ACCESS`
  request, store-only: the §18.6 boot floor never grows, so the kernel
  inventory drift test pins their `AppInfo.toml` directly with no
  embedded registry row), with `-h`/`-?`/`--help` short help over the
  shared `own_short_help`/`BundleHelp` render and per-locale switch-drift
  pins. Landing `mv` added the missing `EXDEV` equivalent in place
  (`abi-v1` unfrozen): the dedicated `Errno::CrossVolume` /
  `VfsError::CrossVolume` a cross-mount `fs_rename` is refused with
  (regression-tested; C header regenerated), so `mv`'s copy-then-remove
  fallback triggers on exactly that condition and no other.
  **Done: `useradd`, `groupadd`** — store-only bundles over the existing
  `users_admin` syscall (`CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` + `CAP_USER_ADMIN` +
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS`; no console-read — they never prompt), each with a
  host-tested production `users_admin` client behind injected
  channel/entropy seams. The shared account-authoring policy
  (`DEFAULT_SHELL`, `default_home`, `next_id` id auto-allocation) was
  hoisted into `lib/users` and the `users` session + `tools/mkimage`
  deduplicated onto it. `useradd` creates the account with an unusable
  random password record (the GNU `!`-field equivalent — a password is
  set afterwards via the `users` tool), the session-baseline ceiling,
  and the shared shell/home defaults.
  **Done: `chmod`** — registered in the change that landed its syscall:
  `fs_set_mode` (74, the `chmod(2)` shape; `CAP_FS_ACCESS`-gated, audited,
  mode word validated to `FS_MODE_MASK` at dispatch and again at the
  service seam, never masked) flows dispatcher → `MountedFilesystemService`
  → `Vfs::set_mode_via_secured` → the per-inode `DelegatedFs::set_mode`,
  where only the inode's **owner** may change its mode (no
  write-implies-chmod, no capability override, `required_cap` honoured,
  read-only mounts refused), rewriting only the driver security record's
  mode field. The bundle is store-only (console-write + `CAP_FS_ACCESS`),
  with the thirteen-locale `Help/` tree, `-h`/`-?` over `lib/help`, and
  the `tairix_sys_fs_set_mode` stub + `TAIRIX_FS_MODE_MASK` in the regenerated C
  header. `fstree`'s `a` mode editor is the second caller.
  **Remaining, blocked on kernel prerequisites:** `chown` needs the fs
  owner-set syscall, `getcap`/`setcap` need per-inode
  capability-requirement get/set syscalls, and `mount` needs the mount
  syscall — none exists yet, and a stubbed production seam is forbidden;
  each tool registers in the change that lands its syscall.
- **Stage C — missing coreutils commands (in progress; all wanted).**
  Every GNU coreutils command implementable on the current floor, in
  prioritised batches. **Done: `true`, `false`, `yes`, `basename`,
  `dirname`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `head`, `wc`, `tee`, `seq`, `whoami`,
  `du`, `df`, `printf`** — each a
  full self-contained store bundle (console-write +
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS` request — plus console-read for the stdin-reading
  `head`/`wc`/`tee` — store-only: the §18.6 boot floor never grows,
  so the kernel inventory drift test pins their `AppInfo.toml` directly)
  with the complete GNU surface, thirteen-locale `Help/` trees, and
  switch-drift pins. `true`/`false` parse infallibly (only a *first*
  argument of `-h`/`-?`/`--help` is honoured, the GNU position rule);
  the one documented divergence is that `false`'s served short help
  exits `0` per §4, where GNU `false --help` exits `1`. `basename` and
  `dirname` are purely lexical, with one shared TAIRiX extension: a
  `Name:/` alias root plays the role POSIX gives `/`, decided by the
  path grammar's own exported rule (`tairix_path::alias_root_len`, the
  §2.2 one-definition seam added for exactly these lexical tools) —
  never a second path parser. Landing `mkdir`/`rmdir` evolved `abi-v1`
  in place (unfrozen, the `mv`/`CrossVolume` precedent): the dedicated
  `Errno::NotADirectory`/`Errno::NotEmpty` codes (`VfsError` now maps
  `AlreadyExists`/`NotADirectory`/`NotEmpty` precisely instead of
  collapsing them onto `OutOfRange`; C header regenerated with the new
  errnos, `TAIRIX_UNLINK_FLAG_DIRECTORY`, and the previously-unpublished
  `TAIRIX_OPEN_FLAG_*` bits) and a validated `UnlinkFlags` word on
  `fs_unlink` whose `DIRECTORY` bit is the atomic
  `rmdir(2)`/`unlinkat(AT_REMOVEDIR)` posture, decided by the
  filesystem under its own lock — `rmdir` (and `rm`'s own directory
  removals, migrated to the flag) carries no stat/remove race, and
  `--ignore-fail-on-non-empty` tolerates exactly `NotEmpty`. Both
  tools' `-p` walks share the one ancestor-spelling rule
  (`tairix_path::Path::prefix`, the §2.2 seam added for exactly these
  walks); `mkdir`'s GNU `-m` remains staged — its kernel prerequisite
  (`fs_set_mode`, Stage B `chmod`) now exists, and the flag lands with
  its own tests in its own change, never stubbed. `head`
  implements the full GNU surface — `-n`/`-c` with the leading `-`
  elide form and the multiplier suffix alphabet, `-q`/`-v`/`-z`,
  bundles/permutation, and the obsolete first-argument
  `-COUNT[bkm][lqvz]` form (including GNU's quirk that a multiplier
  letter keeps scaling after a later `l`) — streaming in constant
  memory (a circular byte ring for `-c -N`; a last-N-lines queue whose
  unterminated final fragment counts as a line). `wc` implements
  `-c`/`-m`/`-l`/`-w`/`-L`, `--total` (GNU argmatch prefixes), and
  `--files0-from` with the exact GNU column-width rule (summed
  regular-file sizes via the three-way `SizeProbe` seam; 7-column
  minimum for non-regular inputs; unpadded single-input/single-count,
  files0, and total-only forms); `-m` decodes UTF-8 incrementally
  across chunks (an encoding-error byte is a byte, not a character)
  and `-L` measures columns through the one `tairix_vt::char_width`
  definition — never a second width table. `tee` implements
  `-a`/`--append`, `-p`, and `--output-error[=MODE]` (argmatch
  prefixes; the value only attached with `=`, a bare `--output-error`
  selecting `warn-nopipe`) with the GNU `tee.c` failure discipline (a
  failed output is diagnosed, dropped, and the run continues or stops
  per mode; reading stops when no output remains). Two documented
  divergences: TAIRiX has no `SIGPIPE`, so the modes' "pipe" class maps
  to the standard-output copy (the one output that can be a pipe; the
  default mode's stdout failure stops the run fail-loud), and
  `-i`/`--ignore-interrupts` is staged behind per-process
  signal-disposition kernel work (nothing exists to set today), never
  stubbed — the `mkdir -m` precedent. `seq` implements the full GNU
  surface — `-f`/`--format` (a validated one-directive printf float
  format rendered by a C-locale `%e`/`%f`/`%g`/`%a` engine),
  `-s`/`--separator`, `-w`/`--equal-width`, GNU operand scanning (no
  permutation, negative-number operands), the spelling-derived default
  precision/width, the exact decimal fast path (arbitrary-size integer
  runs, `inf` LAST), and the extra-number rounding rule — with one
  documented divergence: the float path computes in `f64`, not glibc's
  `long double` (visibly, `%a` prints the `double` spelling `0x1.8p+0`
  rather than `%La`'s `0xcp-3`). `printf` implements the full GNU
  surface — the escape set (`\NNN`/`\xHH`/`\uHHHH`/`\UHHHHHHHH`, `\c`
  ending all output), every conversion (`diouxX`, `eEfFgGaA`, `%c`,
  `%s`, `%b` with `\0NNN` octal, `%q` quotearg-style shell quoting,
  `%%`) with the C flags and `*`-settable width/precision, format
  reuse, base-0/char-constant argument reading, and the GNU
  diagnostics and exit model (conversion errors continue and exit `1`;
  an invalid conversion specification or malformed escape is fatal
  with prior output kept; the per-conversion flag-validity table is
  probe-pinned against GNU coreutils). Landing it hoisted the two
  C-locale engines `seq` already carried into `lib/util` for the
  second consumer: `tairix_util::cfloat` (the printf float renderer
  behind `seq -f` and `printf`'s float conversions) and
  `tairix_util::cnum` (the `strtod` scanner, now with longest-prefix
  `endptr` semantics — `seq` demands full consumption, `printf`
  diagnoses the remainder). Two documented divergences: the
  `f64`-not-`long double` computation (the `seq` precedent) and the
  TAIRiX first-argument `-h`/`-?`/`--help` short-help convention
  (`printf -- -h…` spells such a format). `whoami` prints the name paired with
  the caller's uid: the uid comes from the kernel-attested origin
  record (the ungated `self_origin` syscall) and the name from the
  ungated `USER_DIRECTORY` sysinfod query over the shared
  `tairix_procinfo` account-directory walk (the `top` USER-column
  helper, one definition); a uid with no directory entry is the GNU
  `cannot find name for user ID` diagnostic, and a failed walk is a
  service error, never misreported as a missing name. `du` walks its
  operands post-order over the `fs_*` seams with an explicit frame
  stack, measuring each node's `fs_stat` `allocated` bytes by default
  (`--apparent-size`/`-b` for lengths) and implementing `-a`/`-s`/`-c`/
  `-d`/`-S`/`-0` plus the GNU unit options; the `-B` grammar, ceiling
  block scaling, and `human_ceiling` renderings live once in
  `tairix_util::size` (a §2.2 `lib/util` promotion, shared with `df`).
  `df` renders the GNU table (auto-sized columns, `-a`/`-T`/`-t`/`-x`/
  `-i`/`-P`/`-l`/`--total`, operand→covering-mount by longest prefix)
  from the ungated `MOUNT_LIST` rows, which now carry each volume's
  `VolumeStats` — the support work: a new versioned `FilesystemStats`
  driver-ABI extension (`stats() -> VolumeStats`, arxfs reports its
  live accounting with the metadata reserve withheld from
  `avail_blocks` and the honest zero inode pair), `MountRecord` evolved
  in place to embed the usage block (invariant-checked on construct and
  decode; C header regenerated), and the kernel mount snapshot now
  reporting each backed mount's registration `source`/`fstype` names
  (`LateFilesystem::register` carries them) plus the driver's live
  stats — an unbacked mount truthfully reports empty names and the
  all-zero usage, which `df` hides by default and notes on fd 3
  (`fs.mounts_omitted`). Documented divergences: `du` has no link
  deduplication — a multiply-named file counts once per name until the
  readdir record carries a node identity, Stage E — and no `-x` (no device
  identity); `df` stages `--output`/`--sync`; neither reads the
  `*_BLOCK_SIZE` environment family. `echo` and `pwd`
  from the first batch
  stay `elsh` builtins for now (`pwd` needs the shell's cwd state, and
  the shell resolves builtins first, so a store bundle of either would
  be unreachable duplication); moving them out is decided when the
  builtin/bundle split is revisited. **Done: `tail`** — a full
  self-contained store bundle (console-write + console-read +
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, store-only) with the GNU surface implementable on
  the current floor: `-n`/`-c` with the leading `+` "from unit N" form
  and the multiplier alphabet, `-q`/`-v`/`-z`, the obsolete
  first-argument `{+,-}COUNT[bcl]` form, headers, and permutation.
  Landing it hoisted the two mechanisms `head` already carried into
  `lib/util` for the second consumer: `tairix_util::count` (the GNU
  `-c`/`-n` count-with-multiplier grammar) and
  `tairix_util::tailwindow` (the bounded rolling last-N `ByteWindow`/
  `LineWindow` — `head`'s elide and `tail`'s last-N are the two
  policies over one mechanism), and `head` was refactored onto both.
  `tail` emits one advisory `omission` record on fd 3 when it drops
  leading content (`text.leading_lines_omitted` /
  `text.leading_bytes_omitted`). The follow family is **implemented in
  full** (`-f`/`-F`/`--follow[=descriptor|name]`/`--retry`/`--pid`/
  `--sleep-interval`/`--max-unchanged-stats` and the obsolete trailing
  `f`): a follow blocks off-CPU on a new kernel file-change wait source
  and re-emits appended data as each file grows, handling truncation,
  rotation (name follow reopens the replaced file), retry of an absent
  name, and `--pid` termination — never a busy poll. Landing it added
  the wake source: a stable node identity `tairix_abi::FileId`
  `{volume, node}` carried on `FileStat`, a `WaitSourceKind::File`
  wait-set member keyed on it (fd-resolved, edge-triggered on a
  per-`FileId` change generation), the `kernel/core::fswatch` per-volume
  tables (targeted wakes, an `active` fast path so an unwatched write pays
  one atomic load), and the change hooks in the cached volume layer every
  mounted volume's mutations pass through (write/truncate/metadata → the
  node's id, create/unlink/rename/mkdir → the parent directory's id;
  `docs/src/filesystem/watch.md`).
  `--pid` liveness reuses the System Information process list
  (`tairix_procinfo`); a process the caller cannot observe reads as gone
  (fail closed, documented). **Done: `sleep`** — a full self-contained store bundle
  (console-write + `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, store-only) with the complete GNU
  surface: it pauses for the sum of its `NUMBER[SUFFIX]` operands (`s`/`m`/
  `h`/`d`, seconds the default), each a C-locale float scanned through the
  shared `tairix_util::cnum::scan_double` (the one `seq`/`printf` use, never
  a second number parser), with `inf`/`infinity` a pause until killed, and
  the GNU `missing operand` / `invalid time interval` diagnostics (a
  negative, `nan`, unknown suffix, or trailing junk). The pause is genuinely
  off-CPU: the production sleeper parks the task on the runtime's clock-backed
  timed wait (`ClockDelay`) in bounded chunks — `sleep inf` re-parks forever
  — never a busy-loop on a clock read. One documented divergence, shared with
  every TAIRiX command app: there is no OS-wide version string, so `sleep`
  does not implement GNU's `--version`; the reserved `-h`/`-?`/`--help`
  short-help convention stands in. It emits nothing on fd 3 (a pause hides,
  omits, and summarises nothing). Remaining first batch:
  `env`, `date`, `id`; then the text tools `sort`,
  `uniq`, `tr`, `cut`, `paste`, `comm`, `nl`, `tac`, `fold`, `expand`,
  `od`, `split`, `shuf`, `truncate`, `mktemp`, `realpath`, `chgrp`,
  `sha256sum`/`cksum`, `base64`). Each is a full self-contained
  bundle (§16.5) with tests and a thirteen-locale `Help/` tree; anything a
  shell builtin duplicates moves out of `elsh` where applicable.
- **Stage D — filesystem timestamps (in progress).** The driver-level
  `NodeTimes` (four `Time64` stamps) is plumbed through
  `fs_stat`/`FileStat` as an in-place `abi-v1` evolution (`FileStat` now
  embeds `NodeTimes`, `WIRE_LEN` 64→112; the driver `NodeInfo` carries
  `times` and the old optional `FilesystemTimestamps` trait and separate
  `DirEntry.modified` stamp are deleted). **Done: `ls`** long-format date
  column, the `-t` time sort, the `-c`/`-u`/`--time` time-field selection,
  the `locale`/`long-iso`/`full-iso`/`iso` `--time-style` renders and
  `--full-time`, and the `-i`/`--inode` node-number column. `ls`
  decomposes a stamp through the one shared civil-date breakdown
  (`tairix_fsmeta::calendar::CivilTime`, which the login clock and
  `fstree`'s stamp column now share too, §2.2); a custom
  `--time-style=+FORMAT` is refused (fail closed) until the `date` command
  that will share a `strftime` engine exists. ARXFS does not track atime
  (reports `accessed` = epoch). **Remaining:** `touch`, `cp -p`/`-u`,
  `mv -u`, `date -r`.
- **Stage E — VFS links (done).** Symbolic *and* hard links are real in the
  VFS and ARXFS, and `ln` (both kinds, `-L`/`-P`/`-d`/`-F`/`-r`), `ls -L`/`-H`
  and its link-count column, `du`'s deduplication of a multiply-named file
  (over the node identity the `fs_readdir` record now carries), `cp`'s link
  options, and the `readlink`, `link` and `unlink` command apps have landed —
  the design is `plans/SYMLINKS.md`, not a separate one.

  The three new bundles are deliberately **minimal**: `link` and `unlink`
  take exactly the operands their POSIX call takes and carry no option but
  the reserved short help, because `ln` and `rm` are the tools with the
  option surface — a script that must make one hard link, or remove one
  name, gets a tool that *cannot* replace a name, follow a link, or recurse.
  `readlink` implements GNU's `-f`/`-e`/`-m` by **calling** the VFS's one
  canonicalisation (`fs_realpath`, `plans/SYMLINKS.md` S8) rather than
  walking links itself: physical `..`, the hop budget, a per-component
  permission check, and the mount-projection floor are properties of that
  walk, and a userland copy disagreeing by one of them would print a path the
  kernel resolves differently. The three switches are alternatives choosing
  how much of the path must exist, so they are one parsed value and the last
  one given wins. `ln -r`/`--relative` is the other consumer: it spells the
  difference between two *canonical* paths — exact, because neither holds a
  `..` or a link — and is a usage error without `-s`, since a hard link
  stores no target to make relative.

  `cp` gained the link options too: `-l` (a second name for the source's
  node instead of a copy of its bytes), `-s` (a symbolic link naming the
  source), `-P`/`--no-dereference` (reproduce a link source as a link
  storing the same target, verbatim), and `--preserve=links` (two sources
  naming one node get two *names* at the destination, keyed on the identity
  the `fs_stat`/`fs_readdir` record now carries, remembering only nodes
  whose name count exceeds one). `-d` is exactly `-P --preserve=links`,
  spelled as the pair so its halves cannot drift. Because a link is
  *created*, and a create never replaces a name, an occupied destination
  needs `-f` first; the byte copy still truncates through its own create.

  **`-a`/`--archive` and the rest of `--preserve` are refused, not
  narrowed**: `-a` is `-dR --preserve=all`, `--preserve=all` includes a
  node's timestamps, and **no syscall can set a timestamp** (`fs_set_mode`
  and `fs_set_owner` exist; no `fs_set_times` does), so honouring `-a`
  would report a preservation that did not happen. `-dR` is the rest of it.
  Lifting the refusal means adding that call — an ABI + VFS + per-driver
  change, its own entry, not a corner of this stage.

  The Stage E list originally also named "`stat`'s link fields", which
  presupposed a bundle that did not exist. Authoring a GNU `stat` is a
  bundle of its own rather than a link-field addition, so it is Stage F.
- **Stage F — `stat` (done).** A full self-contained store bundle
  (console-write + `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, store-only) rendering the fields of one
  `fs_stat` per operand: the default report, `-c`/`--format`, `--printf`
  (the two differing in exactly the trailing newline and whether backslash
  escapes are interpreted), `-t`/`--terse`, `-L`/`--dereference`, and
  `-f`/`--file-system` with its own separate specifier vocabulary over the
  volume's `VolumeStats`. A directive carries the printf flags, width, and
  precision (`%-10s`, `%06i`, `%.3n`), so the report lines up in columns;
  the default and terse forms are themselves formats, so there is one
  renderer rather than a hand-written report per form.

  **Without `-L` a link is described as itself**, which is what the tool is
  for beside `ls`: the production seam opens `NO_FOLLOW`, so the descriptor's
  flags fix the posture and the stat served for it cannot contradict the open.
  `%m` and `%o` come from the System Information mount snapshot, keyed on the
  *canonical* path (`fs_realpath`) and matched by whole components, so a link
  into another volume reports the volume it lands on and `/vol` never claims
  `/volume/x`; `%U` comes from the ungated user directory `whoami` reads.
  Neither adds a capability.

  **Four specifiers are refused by name rather than fabricated**, each for a
  concept TAIRiX genuinely lacks: `%G` (the System Information API publishes a
  user directory and no group counterpart, so `%g` is the honest field),
  `%t`/`%T` of the file vocabulary (no device special files, so no major or
  minor type — the `-t` terse form omits those two columns rather than
  printing zeroes), and `%t` of the filesystem vocabulary (a volume has no
  numeric type magic; `%T` names the type its mount records). The refusal is
  decided when the format is parsed, before any path is touched, so a format
  the platform cannot serve never half-renders. **Two specifiers report the
  TAIRiX concept**: a volume is identified by a 16-byte id rather than a
  device number, so `%d` is that id in decimal and `%D` in hex — comparing
  two files' `%d` still answers exactly "are these on one volume?". A fact
  that cannot be read renders `?` (or GNU's `UNKNOWN` for a name), never a
  plausible substitute.

## 12.2 Terminal colour, the standard scheme, and box drawing

**Status: in progress** (deliverable 9): the shared `tairix_vt::scheme`
palette, the one `tairix_termcap::resolve_color` `--color[=WHEN]` decision, the
first adoption (`ls` file kinds), and `lib/help`'s coloured `man`/short-help
renders have landed; `fstree` and box drawing remain. Binding design for how command apps and
full-screen curses apps use colour, emphasis, and box drawing. Everything here
rides the one terminal vocabulary (`lib/vt`), capability database
(`lib/termcap`), and screen model (`lib/curses`) of `plans/CURSES.md` — no
second escape table, colour list, or glyph set anywhere (§2.2).

- **Use colour where possible and appropriate.** Command apps SHOULD use
  colour — and the other SGR emphasis attributes (bold, underline, dim,
  italic) — wherever it genuinely helps a human read the output: `ls` file
  kinds, `grep` matches, `fstree` structure, `man`'s rendered Markdown,
  diagnostics, and any future command with visually distinguishable classes
  of output. "Appropriate" is a judgement, not a quota: colour marks
  *meaningful distinctions* (kinds, matches, severities, structure), never
  decoration for its own sake, and a tool whose output has no such
  distinctions adds none. Colour and emphasis are presentation only: the
  information MUST survive with every attribute stripped (a mono terminal,
  a colourblind reader, and a script see the same facts), so colour is never
  the *sole* carrier of a distinction.
- **The standard TAIRiX colour scheme.** There is exactly **one** standard
  terminal colour scheme, defined once as data (a semantic-role palette,
  proposed home `tairix_vt::scheme` beside the SGR vocabulary it maps onto;
  the implementing change confirms the home and updates the crate docs) and
  imported by every consumer — `lib/help`'s renders, `lib/curses` defaults,
  and each command app — never a per-tool colour list (§2.2). The scheme
  maps **semantic roles** (heading, emphasis, literal/code, path/directory,
  executable, match/highlight, error, warning, success, metadata/dim,
  selection, border) onto the SGR palette; tools name roles, never raw
  colour numbers, so the scheme can evolve as data. Design requirements,
  binding on the concrete palette:
  - **No eye strain.** Comfortable contrast against both dark and light
    terminal backgrounds; no low-contrast pairings (saturated pure blue on
    black, dark grey on black) and no vibrating complementary pairs.
  - **Aesthetic.** The palette is designed as a coherent whole and reviewed
    as one — not a per-tool accretion of defaults.
  - **Mindful of colourblind users, without being reduced by them.** No
    distinction is encoded *solely* as a hue pair the common colour-vision
    deficiencies confuse (red-vs-green above all): such roles also differ in
    brightness or attribute (bold/underline). The scheme still uses the full
    palette — it serves every user and does not collapse to a
    deficiency-safe subset.
  - **Degrades deterministically.** Roles render honestly at the terminal's
    attested colour depth through the one `lib/termcap` capability judgement
    (truecolour → 256 → 16 → mono, `plans/CURSES.md`); on `dumb`/mono the
    roles degrade to plain or attribute-only output, never to garbage.
- **Colour is render-to-terminal only — piped output stays clean.** Colour
  MUST NOT interfere with processing of a command's output. Escape sequences
  are applied only in the render-to-terminal path, decided by the same
  console attestation the `man` pager already uses (§7): the kernel attests
  geometry only for a console it owns, so a redirected, piped, or otherwise
  non-console `stdout` fails that probe closed and the tool emits **plain
  bytes with no escape codes** — `ls | wc -l` and `ls > file` see exactly
  the uncoloured render. Apart from the SGR sequences themselves, the
  coloured and plain renders are byte-identical: colour never changes
  columns, ordering, quoting, wording, or exit status (§16.7). Tools whose
  GNU counterpart takes `--color[=WHEN]` (`ls`, `grep`, …) spell it
  identically (§1.1): `auto` (the default, attestation-decided), `always`
  (explicit override — e.g. a serial or remote session the kernel cannot
  attest, where the fail-closed default is plain), and `never`. Colour never
  guesses: an unattested console renders plain until a finer "stdout is an
  interactive terminal" attestation exists (staged with deliverable 9), and
  `--color=always` is the honest escape hatch meanwhile.
- **`man` renders Markdown with colour and emphasis.** As part of its
  ability to parse the Help Markdown (§3, §7), `man` — that is, the one
  `lib/help` `render_full`/`render_short` engine every consumer shares —
  SHOULD use the standard scheme wherever possible: section headings bold in
  the heading role, `*emphasis*`/`**strong**` as the italic/bold SGR
  attributes, inline code and fenced blocks in the literal role, `OPTIONS`
  switch keys highlighted, and `SEE ALSO` references in the path role. The
  same terminal-only rule applies (a piped `man ls` emits plain text), the
  content is unchanged either way, and the render still degrades through the
  `TermType` capability record.
- **Box drawing uses the Unicode Box Drawing block.** A full-screen curses
  app (`top`, `edit`, the planned `sysmon`, …) draws every box, border,
  divider, and rule it uses with glyphs from the standard **Unicode Box
  Drawing block (U+2500 through U+257F)** — `─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼` and
  their heavy/double variants — via `lib/curses`'s box/border/line-drawing
  API (`plans/CURSES.md` C4), never hand-rolled ASCII art (`+`/`-`/`|`) and
  never a private glyph table. The ASCII fallback exists in exactly one
  place — `lib/curses`'s degrade path for a `TermType` whose capability
  record cannot carry the block (e.g. `dumb`) — so every app degrades
  identically (§2.2, fail closed §2.9).

## 13. Deliverables and required `AGENTS.md` amendments

Staged work (dependencies: the bundle/`appmgr` stack and `plans/CURSES.md`,
both landed; `plans/SHELL.md` command execution):

1. **`lib/abi` — `BundleEntry::Help`** — **done.** The maintainer chose the
   merge, so `Documentation` was renamed to `Help` in place (§2.13):
   enum/`ALL`/`as_str`, rustdoc, the `appinfo` and `appmgr` fixtures,
   `docs/src/abi/appinfo.md`, and the regenerated C header
   (`TAIRIX_BUNDLE_ENTRY_HELP`); the retired name now fails
   `validate_bundle_layout` closed.
2. **`lib/help` (`tairix-help`)** — **done.** The one help engine (§6):
   validated `Locale`/`DocumentName` spellings, the injected `HelpSource`
   read seam, the §5 fallback chain (served locale reported for `stdinfo`),
   the bounded structured-Markdown parser (fixed §3 section model, typed
   `HelpError`, fence-aware section walk), and `render_short`/`render_full`
   over `lib/vt` (widths from `lib/curses`). It also owns a command's
   **own** §4 short help in one place: the pure `own_short_help` render
   (LANG parse, load, short view, `lib/vt` bytes; `None` falls back to the
   caller's usage banner) and the `rt`-feature `BundleHelp` production
   source over the app's own store bundle — shared by every `Run` binary,
   never re-derived per tool. Unit tests, the `fuzz_help`
   harness registered in `cargo xtask fuzz` (§19.6), rustdoc,
   `lib/help/README.md`, `docs/src/lib/help.md`, and the §3 crate list are
   in place.
3. **`man.app`** — **done.** The TAIRiX `man` command app (§7):
   `userland/apps/man` resolves the word over `tairix_cmdres::
   bundle_candidates` (first existing bundle wins; `NotFound` moves on, any
   other refusal is final) and then, for a bare word no candidate matched,
   over the §7 bounded recursive search of `/Apps` and the user's own two
   stores (`tairix_cmdres::search_roots`), loads and renders through `lib/help`,
   reads `LANG`/`PATH`/`HOME` from the inherited environment, pages on a
   geometry-attested console (space/return/`q`, echo suppressed) and
   streams otherwise, and emits the §7 `stdinfo` `context` record
   (`help.locale_fallback`) on a locale fallback. Registered as
   `/System/Commands/man.app/Run` (manifest: console pair + `CAP_FS_ACCESS`);
   its own thirteen-locale `Help/` tree is authored on disk in the bundle and
   read at runtime through the `BundleStore` seam (no help embedded in the
   binary, §6.1) — the tree is discovered by `tools/syshelp` and planted on
   the read-only `/System` volume by `tools/mkimage` and the QEMU image
   fixture; the `session_ceiling` vertical types `man man` end to end.
4. **Shell command resolution** — **done**:
   the §8 fixed-prefix-then-`PATH` resolution and `.app`-suffix invocation
   (§9) are live. The store/bundle spellings live once in `lib/abi`
   (`SYSTEM_COMMAND_STORE`/`SYSTEM_APPLICATION_STORE`/the home store names/
   `BUNDLE_SUFFIX`); every OS command app is registered as
   `/System/Commands/{cat,clear,elsh,ls,man,ps,reset,sysinfo,top,users}.app/Run`
   (`spawn_paths.rs`, drift-tested); the pure candidate policy
   (`tairix_cmdres::resolution_candidates` in the shared `lib/cmdres`
   crate, taking the session's `CommandEnv { home, path_var }`, alias-aware
   `PATH` split, plus the `bundle_candidates` view for `man`'s bundle lookup)
   is unit-tested — including that no `PATH` value can displace the prefix; the interpreter maps launch
   failures onto `127`/`126`; the shell passes the typed words and
   exported environment to every launched program over the `spawn`
   startup-strings block (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP8 — the §5 locale variable
   and `man <cmd>`'s argument now reach a child); and the session-ceiling
   QEMU vertical proves the bare word `ps` **and** a delivered `ps
   --bogus` argument end to end.
5. **`cargo xtask help-lint`** — **done.** The §8.1 gate, wired into
   `cargo xtask ci` (and `ci-long`) among the cheap fail-fast checks. The
   judgement is one definition, `tairix_help::lint_help_trees` (`lib/help`'s
   host-only `lint` cargo feature; pure rows-in/violations-out, unit-tested
   per violation class), shared by the gate and the `tools/syshelp`
   aggregator tests (§2.2) so the two can never diverge. It checks, over the
   build-discovered `tairix_syshelp::HELP_FILES` rows (the same data the
   image planters plant): locale/document spellings and the `lib/help`
   structural bounds (§6), `en-US/` presence and completeness across the
   standing `tairix_help::REQUIRED_LOCALES` set, no translation-only
   documents (§2.1), per-item backticked switch keys and cross-locale
   `OPTIONS` key equality against `en-US/` (§3.1 — the per-app unit tests
   keep pinning `en-US/` to each parser, which only the app crate knows),
   and the closed content-policy screen (whole-word, case-insensitive, plus
   the CJK substring screen over the text as it renders, so neither a line
   break nor markup splits a phrase past it, over every locale). The gate
   additionally
   verifies coverage: every command
   app the `AppInfo.toml` discovery walk finds ships its
   `en-US/<command>.md` (never a per-bundle list). Any violation fails
   closed with a message naming the offending `bundle/locale/file`.
6. **`Help/` trees for the existing command apps** — **done for every
   store-registered command app**: `basename`, `cat`, `clear`, `cp`,
   `dirname`, `edit`, `false`, `groupadd`, `head`, `ls`, `mkdir`,
   `mv`, `ps`, `reset`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `seq`, `sleep`, `tail`, `tee`, `top`, `true`, `sysinfo`, `useradd`,
   `users`, `wc`, `whoami`, `yes`, and `elsh` each author their thirteen-locale tree on disk in the bundle,
   discovered by `tools/syshelp` (roots `userland/apps` and
   `userland/shell`), planted at `/System/Commands/<cmd>.app/Help/`, and served
   at runtime through the `HelpSource` seam — never embedded in the binary
   (§6.1) — for each tool's §4 `-h`/`-?` short help (a per-locale
   switch-drift unit test pins each tree's `OPTIONS` to its parser, §3.1).
   The tools that gained filesystem reach for that read request
   `CAP_FS_ACCESS` in their manifests (the man/ls precedent — the secured
   VFS still authorises per-inode). The not-yet-registered utilities
   (`chmod`, `chown`, `mount`, `getcap`,
   `setcap`, `terminal`, …) gain their trees in the
   same change that registers each as a store bundle (§12.1 Stage B). Each new tree ships
   by dropping its `Help/` files under the bundle — `tools/syshelp`
   rediscovers them, and no image-builder list is edited (§6.1).

7. **`stdinfo` adoption in command apps (§12)** — emit the appropriate
   `StdInfoRecord` (via the `lib/rt` wrapper) wherever a command omits,
   summarises, or adds non-obvious context to `stdout`. Live: `man`'s
   locale-fallback record (§7), `ls`'s `fs.hidden_entries_omitted`
   omission record (the `AGENTS.md` §20.1 canonical example), and the
   `proc.self_scope_only` omission record both `ps` and
   `sysinfo processes` emit on their default self-scoped listing (one
   shared definition, `tairix_procinfo::emit_self_scope_omission`,
   parametrised only by each tool's widening spelling — `ps -e` /
   `sysinfo processes --all` — over the shared
   `tairix_procinfo::Output::info` fd 3 seam, fail-closed on an argv
   token that would break the record's JSON); advisory-only, never
   changing exit status. `tail` emits an `omission` record
   (`text.leading_lines_omitted` / `text.leading_bytes_omitted`) when it
   drops the leading content its window/skip discards, over its own
   injected fd 3 `Info` seam. The remaining registered commands were
   surveyed and have nothing non-obvious to add today: `cat` and `users`
   omit nothing from stdout, and a per-refresh record from full-screen
   `top` would be the progress spam §20.1 forbids. A future command adds its
   record in the change that creates the omission/summary, through a
   shared definition when two tools share the behaviour.

8. **Self-contained on-disk bundles — retire the kernel-baked spawn
   registry (§16.5 self-containment and §16.2 services-are-apps
   amended).** Every discovered bundle — the command apps *and* the
   `login`/`devmgr`/`sysinfod` services (a service is an app, §16.2) —
   ships complete on the read-only `/System` volume: its signed `AppInfo`
   + `Run` rxe beside its `Help/` tree, at the bundle-form paths
   (`/System/Commands/<cmd>.app/`, `/System/Applications/<name>.app/`,
   `/System/Services/<name>.app/`) PID 1
   `init` and the shell name. The binding increment list, with
   per-increment status and the load-bearing invariants, lives in
   `PLAN.md` ("Self-contained bundles"). Increments 1–4 are **done**: the
   canonical bundle content-hash framing (`lib/abi`), the per-crate
   `AppInfo.toml` discovery walk + composer signing under the dedicated
   `SYSTEM_APP_SIGNING_SEED`, the image/fixture planting of every signed
   bundle, the shared `lib/appload` verification engine (`appmgr`
   re-exports it), and the `spawn` syscall loading + verifying store
   bundles from the mounted volume through `tairix_appload` — deriving the
   child's capability request from the on-disk manifest, parking a
   boot-race spawn on the `AppStore` readiness latch, and dropping every
   embedded rxe row from the aarch64 production boot (the system
   principal resolves via the bootstrap identity before the root unlock,
   so PID 1 can load the service bundles pre-passphrase). Verification
   runs **once per boot** per read-only store bundle: the accepted
   result is cached in the `AppStore` (LRU under a
   discovered-RAM-fraction byte budget) and a later launch serves the
   cached image after re-authorising the caller's read of `Run` through
   the secured VFS, so command-launch latency stays off the whole-bundle
   hash/signature path; writable-volume bundles are never cached.
   **Remaining:**
   increment 5 — the x86_64/riscv64 storage floor, then deletion of
   `SPAWN_PROGRAMS`, the `*_rxe.rs` `include!`s (all but PID 1 `init`),
   `spawn_paths.rs`, and `program_manifests.rs` (§2.14); until then those
   two ports carry the embedded registry as their explicitly-justified
   §18.6 boot floor. All prior deliverables' references to
   `/System/Commands/<cmd>.app/Run` being served from `spawn_paths.rs` are
   superseded by this on-disk-bundle model.

9. **The standard colour scheme, coloured renders, and box drawing
   (§12.2)** — **in progress.** One properly-gated staging:
   - **Done — the shared semantic-role palette.** `tairix_vt::scheme`
     (`Role` → `Style`, home confirmed beside the SGR vocabulary; crate
     docs + `docs/src/lib/vt.md` updated) maps the §12.2 roles onto the
     16 ANSI colours, reinforcing the red/green roles (error/success)
     with bold so no distinction rests on hue alone. `Style::open`
     yields the ordered `Sgr` ops; the ideal colours degrade to a
     terminal's depth through `lib/curses`'s one `downgrade`
     (truecolour → 256 → 16 → mono), unit-tested.
   - **Done — the one shared "colour to a terminal only" decision.**
     `tairix_termcap::resolve_color(ColorChoice, attested, term)` folds
     the `--color[=WHEN]` switch (`auto` default, `always`, `never`), the
     console attestation the `man` pager uses (`Output::terminal_width`),
     and `TERM` into one depth-or-plain answer every colour-capable tool
     imports (never a per-tool probe, §2.2); a piped/unattested console
     renders plain under `auto`, and `always` colours at an `Ansi16`
     floor. The finer "stdout is an interactive terminal" attestation for
     consoles the kernel does not own (serial) remains staged behind it,
     to land with its own kernel/ABI design, never guessed at.
   - **Done — first adoption: `ls` file kinds.** Directories and
     executables are coloured through the scheme; the name is painted but
     not the indicator suffix, all layout is computed on the plain width,
     and tests assert the piped render is byte-identical minus the SGR
     sequences. All thirteen `Help/*/ls.md`, the switch-drift pin, and
     `docs/src/userland/utilities.md` document `--color`.
   - **Done — `lib/help`'s coloured `render_full`/`render_short`.** Both
     renderers take a `RenderCtx { locale, styling }` and colour through the
     scheme's roles (headings/sub-headings heading, `*emphasis*` emphasis,
     inline code + fenced blocks literal, `**strong**` bold, table rules
     border), emitting each run flat (open/print/reset) so the plain render is
     byte-identical minus the SGRs. `Styling` is `Plain` (no escapes, for a
     pipe), `Monochrome` (attributes only), or `Colour`; `man` resolves it
     from the console attestation and `TERM` through the one
     `tairix_termcap` judgement (a piped `man ls` is plain) and threads it,
     with the served locale, across the parser-sandbox render boundary (the
     render reply whitelist admits the scheme's SGRs). The same change gave
     `man` (§7) its two other fixes: section headings now **display in the
     served page's language** (`SectionKind::heading_label`, the document keys
     staying language-neutral), and the pager counts **physical** wrapped rows
     (display width, skipping zero-width escapes) so a long line no longer
     scrolls off before `--More--`. `own_short_help` renders `Plain` (an
     unattested `-h` emits no escapes).
   - **Remaining.** Adoption in the other colour-appropriate tools (`fstree`
     structure and its tree rules through `lib/curses`'s U+2500–U+257F box
     glyphs, and each future tool — e.g. `grep`), each in the change that
     lands it, with the same piped-render-is-plain tests and its `Help/`
     trees updated in the same change (§8.1).

Required `AGENTS.md` amendments (each with a one-line rationale in PLAN.md's
"Charter Amendments" section, §13):

- **§16.5** — **done**: `Documentation/` replaced by `Help/` in the bundle
  layout (the merge), with the locale-tree role documented; rationale logged
  in PLAN.md "Charter Amendments".
- **§16.2/§16.3/§16.8** — **done**: `Commands/` and `Applications/` are the
  read-only, system-signed system program stores in the §16.2 authoritative
  subdirectory list, each user's home carries the same pair, and §16.8 binds
  the fixed lookup order (§8); rationale logged in `PLAN.md` "Charter
  Amendments".
- **§16.6/§5.2** — **done**: no new capability is introduced for help or
  command resolution (existing file-access and driver/app-load gates
  suffice, §5.2 minimalism); stated explicitly in the §16.2 program-store
  entries so none is added speculatively.
- **§16.5 (help authoring)** — **done**: added the binding rule that command
  help is authored once in the bundle's on-disk `Help/` tree and read at
  runtime through the `lib/help` seam — never embedded/compiled into a
  program (`include_str!`/`include_bytes!`/baked strings) and never planted
  from a hand-maintained per-bundle list in the image builder. The build
  discovers the trees (`tools/syshelp`, added to §3); the per-app embedded
  `help.rs` copies and the mkimage/fixture lists were deleted (§2.2, §2.14).
  Rationale logged in `PLAN.md` "Charter Amendments".
- **§16.2 (services are apps)** — **done**: a `/System/Services/` service
  ships as the same self-contained, signed `<name>.app` bundle as any app,
  discovered from disk and loaded through the identical verification gate;
  only PID 1 `init` is the compiled-in boot floor. Rationale logged in
  `PLAN.md` "Charter Amendments".
- **§16.5 (self-containment) / §16.2 (the `/System` program stores)** — **done** (charter);
  **code migration open (deliverable 8).** Added the binding rule that an
  app *is* its `<Name>.app/` bundle directory: `Run`, `Code/`, `AppInfo`,
  `Resources/`, `DefaultSettings/`, `Help/`, and any app-private static or
  shared library are all real files inside the folder, discovered from disk;
  app code is never compiled into or served from the kernel/image builder,
  and the store is never a compiled-in registry. The only outside reach is
  the curated `/System/Libraries/` set and the syscall ABI. Rationale logged
  in `PLAN.md` "Charter Amendments"; the code migration off the kernel-baked
  spawn registry is deliverable 8 above.
- **§10 (an app's own icon — mandatory, raster master first)** — **done**: §10
  now states that every command-line and graphical app ships its own icon
  inside its bundle, authored as a PNG raster master (SVG stays accepted), and
  that a declared icon the desktop could not draw fails the build closed. The
  rule itself is §14 below; rationale logged in `PLAN.md` "Charter
  Amendments".

## 14. Every app ships its own icon — mandatory

A new command-line or GUI app is **not complete until it ships its own icon.**
Every bundle a user can launch authors one icon file inside its own bundle and
names it in its manifest:

```
example.app/
├── AppInfo            # library-icon = "example.png"
└── Resources/
    └── example.png    # this bundle's own icon
```

**Why it is mandatory.** The icon is the bundle's identity, not a launcher
decoration: the taskbar, the program-library popup, the desktop, and the file
manager all draw it, and it is independent of whether the bundle is listed in
the program library. A bundle that declares none resolves to the one generic
application picture — so an app that skips its icon makes a store of fifty
programs look like fifty copies of the same one.

**A raster master (PNG) is the form to author.** An app's icon is a rendered
picture of what the program does — lit, shaded, and legible at a glance
(`AGENTS.md` §10) — and the SVG subset draws no soft shading. The master is
square, straight-alpha, at least `MIN_ARTWORK_SIDE` (256×256) so a slot only
ever downscales it, and **trimmed**: its artwork spans the square on its longer
axis and is centred on the shorter one, because margin baked into a master is
spent twice and the icon reads smaller than its neighbours (`plans/ICONS.md`
§1).

**SVG stays accepted**, on the same terms the loader has always applied: a flat
document on a **square** design grid within the supported subset (`lib/svg`),
rasterised at the pixel side the slot draws. Either form is at most
`MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES` (256 KiB) — a fixed validation bound on untrusted input,
not a capacity to raise (§24.4).

**The build proves it, fail closed.** The bundle composer refuses a declared
icon that is absent from the bundle's own `Resources/`, over-long, neither a
decodable PNG nor an in-subset SVG, a non-square, undersized, or untrimmed
raster master, or one that decodes but draws nothing at all. The format is
decided from the *bytes*, exactly as the sandboxed rasteriser decides it at
runtime, never from the file name. "The icon is broken" is therefore a build
failure naming the bundle and the file, never a silent fallback glyph on a
user's desktop.

**Scope.** The rule binds every launchable bundle (`kind = "command"`), windowed
app and text tool alike. A service bundle (`kind = "service"`) and a
resource-only bundle (§10) MAY declare an icon — it is drawn identically — but
neither is required to: the service-bundle class picture is the honest artwork
for something the user does not launch.

Adding an icon is dropping the file in the bundle's own `Resources/` and naming
it in `AppInfo.toml`; there is no list anywhere to edit (§16.5). The artwork
pipeline itself — the resolution tiers, the sandboxed decode, the shared cache —
is `plans/ICONS.md`, which this section does not restate.

## 15. A GUI app starts in the desktop's appearance and follows it live

A windowed app is **not complete until it draws in the appearance the desktop
is actually in, and keeps doing so when the user switches.** Both halves are
required, and neither implies the other:

- **At start-up**, the app queries the desktop before it sizes or paints
  anything (`app::bring_up_desktop`, which is one call and answers the
  `Desktop` plus a `ThemeRegistry` already set to the reported appearance).
  Its first frame is therefore right rather than a guess the user has to watch
  being corrected.
- **Live**, the app converges on the `Desktop` system notice
  (`plans/NOTICE.md`): its wait-set carries the member — the shared app shell
  arms it, so an app that parks through `app::park` gets it for nothing — and
  a `Wake::DesktopChanged` is answered with `app::adopt_desktop`, which reads
  the published state, adopts it into both the `Desktop` and the theme
  registry, and answers whether anything actually moved. A change repaints
  what it invalidates: an appearance or density switch restyles every pixel,
  so the honest scope is the whole surface.

**Why both.** The session cannot re-colour an app's window — those are the
app's own pixels in the app's own frame region — so an app that ignores the
notice sits in the appearance the user just left, on a desktop where
everything else switched. An app that adopts the notice but not the start-up
query opens its *first* window wrong and only becomes correct after the user
happens to switch.

**It applies with no window open too.** The notice is not per-window: an app
closed to its icon-bar slot still holds its wait-set, so it adopts the change
and its next window opens in the appearance in force. That is the case the
per-window announcement this replaced could not serve at all.

**A refused state is stated, never guessed.** `app::adopt_desktop` refuses a
state this build cannot draw at (a scale outside the range `Scale` admits) and
leaves the last good desktop standing; the app reports the refusal on `stderr`
and carries on drawing correctly (§2.24). Before the session has published
anything — an app started in a text-only session — the read answers
`NotFound`, which is an ordinary state and not a failure.

**Scope.** Every bundle that opens a window, and the desktop's own service
windows. A text-only tool has no appearance to follow and arms nothing.

## 16. An app's own settings: which layer needs which authority

An app reaches its settings through `lib/appdata` (`plans/APPDATA.md`), whose
read layering is, lowest precedence first: the bundle's own
`DefaultSettings/`, the machine-wide policy under `/System/Settings/`, then the
user's own file. **Layers 2 and 3 are the app-data service's; layer 1 is the
client's** — nothing attested gives `confd` a bundle path, so the app reads its
own shipped defaults itself.

That split decides the manifest:

- A bundle that **ships `DefaultSettings/`** opens its store with
  `Settings::open`, and therefore MUST request `CAP_FS_ACCESS`: layer 1 is an
  `fs_open` per candidate bundle directory, made by the app.
- A bundle that **ships none** opens with `Settings::open_without_defaults` and
  MUST NOT request `CAP_FS_ACCESS` for this. Asking for filesystem authority so
  that a search for a file the bundle does not contain can fail more tidily
  widens what the app may reach for nothing (§5.2), and issuing the doomed read
  anyway puts an audited capability denial in the log on every store open — a
  security record for something that is not a security event.

Either way the *store* itself needs no capability: it is an ordinary
unprivileged call to the service, gated on the bundle's kernel-attested
identity rather than on anything the bundle asks for.

The bundle composer refuses a source tree carrying a bundle entry it does not
plant, so a `DefaultSettings/` that would silently never reach the image — and
never reach the signed content digest — is a build failure naming the bundle,
not a layer the app mysteriously cannot read.
