# FONT-SERVICE.md — One sandboxed OS font service; no font data in any app

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This plan removes the desktop's slow app launch
at its root and, in doing so, makes text rendering a single, sandboxed,
OS-provided resource — strictly more secure and more memory-efficient than
the per-process font libraries Linux/Windows ship.

The rule this plan enforces is already in the charter: font rendering is a
curated OS shared library, not per-app static data (§16.4); system fonts
live under `/System/Fonts` (§16.2); a parser of untrusted input — font
rendering is named explicitly — runs in a minimum-capability sandbox
process (§19.5); and shared data is defined once, never copied into every
consumer (§2.2, §2.3). The current font stack violates all four.

---

## 1. The defect (measured)

`lib/font` compiles the entire font payload into **every** consumer via
`include_bytes!`:

- `lib/font/src/atlas.rs`: `pub static COVERAGE = include_bytes!("atlas_coverage.bin")`
  — a **3.6 MB** full-Unicode native-size glyph-coverage atlas.
- `lib/font/src/cache.rs`: four embedded TrueType faces — Inconsolata-EX
  (416 KB), MPLUS1Code (1.7 MB), D2Coding (4.0 MB), Noto Sans Hebrew
  (20 KB) ≈ **6.1 MB** — parsed by the in-process `lib/fontface` engine to
  rasterise text at non-native (scaled desktop) sizes.

Every GUI consumer — `userland/apps/{terminal,files,viewer,widgets}`,
`userland/gui/{wm,taskbar,session}` — therefore carries its own private
~10 MB read-only copy. `readelf -lW` on the built `Run` images confirms it:
`terminal` and `files` each have a ~10 MB `R` LOAD segment (0x9b45d8 /
0x9c89b0); a non-GUI app (`cat`) has ~59 KB.

Consequences, all of which this plan removes:

- **Slow launch (the reported bug).** The launch path reads the whole `Run`
  rxe off disk, SHA-256-hashes the whole bundle, and eagerly copies every
  loadable page into private frames. ~10 MB of read + hash + copy per launch
  is slow on metal and glacial under QEMU TCG — for *every* GUI app.
- **Duplication / bloat** (§2.2, §2.3): N copies of identical immutable font
  data on disk and in RAM.
- **Unsandboxed untrusted parsing** (§19.5): the TrueType parser
  (`lib/fontface`) links into every GUI process. A malformed face is a code
  path in the terminal, the file manager, the compositor — not in a
  minimum-capability sandbox.

## 1.1 Constraint — the kernel boot console needs an atlas

`lib/fbcon` (the framebuffer text console) links `lib/font` with
`default-features = false` (no `alloc`) and draws text from the atlas
**before any service exists** — it is boot floor (§18.6), and it is also the
kernel/headless text console. It runs in the kernel and has no way to call a
user-space service for a glyph, so **its repertoire is whatever is compiled
in**: the atlas carries every face the console family names (§2.4), the
Japanese, Korean and Hebrew companions included.

**This is not a size trade to make.** A script left out of the atlas is one
the console can never draw — a `man` page in it, a login prompt, a panic — and
no runtime service can rescue that. At the 8×16 cell the whole family costs
about 1.6 MB compiled in, less than half the 3.6 MB the primary face alone
cost at the old 15×28 cell, so completeness is also the cheaper outcome than
the one it replaced.

**No precomputed full-atlas artifact exists.** `/System/Fonts` holds only the
four committed TrueType faces; `fontd` loads them and rasterises every size
(native and scaled) on demand through the one `lib/fontface` engine, cached.
A second, precomputed full-Unicode atlas beside the faces it is derived from
would be the duplication §2.2 forbids, so there is exactly one runtime
rasterisation source (the faces) and exactly one compiled-in atlas (the
console subset).

---

## 2. Design — a single, sandboxed font service

### 2.1 `fontd` — the font service (`userland/system/fontd`)

A long-running user-space system service shipped as a signed
`/System/Services/fontd.app` bundle (§16.2, §16.5), discovered and spawned
through the normal signature + capability + interface-hash gate (§18.3) —
never baked into the kernel.

- **Owns the font payload**: it scans `/System/Fonts/` at start and reads
  each face's bytes on first use. No font bytes live in any other process.
- **Rasterises in a §19.5 sandbox.** The TrueType parse + outline
  rasterisation (`lib/fontface`) runs only in this service, a
  minimum-capability address space: it requests only
  `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` (to bind the reserved `FONT_ENDPOINT`),
  `CAP_FS_ACCESS` (the one-shot startup read of the faces through the secured
  VFS — `fs_open` is capability-gated regardless of the file's world-readable
  mode), and `CAP_LOG_EMIT` (audit) — no spawn and no network authority, and
  `/System` is mounted read-only so the fs reach can never write. The faces
  are trusted committed OS assets, but isolating the parser in its own address
  space means even a malformed face faults only this sandbox, never a
  compositor or terminal.
- **Serves glyph coverage** over the reserved `FONT_ENDPOINT` (§2.2): a
  [`FontRequest::Glyphs { family, scalars, pixel_height, weight }`] reply is a
  batch of 8-bit coverage bitmaps the client blits, each with the pen advance
  and left side bearing to place it by. The service resolves each scalar
  within the named family — its own faces in order, then its fallback family's
  faces, else U+FFFD — rasterises once at the requested size (4-bit engine
  coverage scaled ×17 to the protocol's 8-bit samples), and memoises in the
  byte-budgeted `(family, resolved family, face, glyph, height, cells,
  weight)` cache of §3.1. The family and its line geometry are resolved once
  for the whole run. The cell count is keyed because how many cells a scalar
  spans is a property of the scalar, not of the glyph a face maps it to. It
  also answers [`FontRequest::Metrics`] with the family's line metrics, and
  [`FontRequest::Families`] with the installed selectable families so a
  settings surface offers exactly what the store holds.

### 2.2 `FONT_ENDPOINT` — the IPC protocol (`lib/abi/src/font_ipc.rs`)

A new reserved-endpoint protocol modelled on `window_ipc.rs` /
`display_ipc.rs`: a fixed-size, bounds-checked request framing and a
length-prefixed coverage reply, both `#[repr(C)]`, versioned and hashed
under the same ABI discipline as the syscall table (§9) and frozen on the
first release (mutable now — `abi-v1` is not frozen). The generated C view
follows (`cargo xtask c-header`).

- Reserved id `FONT_ENDPOINT` (ASCII-hex-spelled, per the existing
  convention; register with `crate::ipc::is_reserved_endpoint`).
- Requests: `Glyphs { family, scalars, pixel_height, weight }`, `Metrics {
  family, pixel_height, weight }` returning the line metrics the client lays
  text out with, and `Families` listing the installed selectable families.
  One fixed request length; every field an operation does not use, and every
  run slot past the run's own length, must be zero, and anything else is
  refused, fail closed (§5.4).
- **The glyph request is per *run*, not per glyph** (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`
  DESK-18): `scalars` is a bounded inline `GlyphRun` of
  1..=`FONT_MAX_GLYPH_RUN` (32) `char`s, held inline because a fixed request
  length is what keeps the frame's validation total. Text is drawn on the
  frame path, so a per-glyph protocol made a newly-opened window a burst of
  blocking round trips; 32 covers a measured burst exactly and keeps the
  request a few hundred bytes.
  A run that asks for nothing is refused — a reply must always answer at
  least one glyph, or a client could never make progress. U+0000 is itself a
  legal scalar, so the run *length* is what tells a scalar asked for from the
  zero padding.
- Replies: a glyph **batch** `{ count, [{ width, height, advance, left,
  bytes[coverage] }] }` (length-bounded; `width == 0` is an ink-less glyph
  such as a space), the metrics `{ pixel_height, baseline, line_height,
  monospace_advance }`, and the family list. `monospace_advance == 0` *is* the
  statement that a family is proportional, so a caller cannot mistake one for
  the other.
- **A batch answers a *prefix* of the run.** One glyph at the extreme of
  `FONT_MAX_COVERAGE_LEN` (512 KiB) fills a reply frame alone, so the service
  appends records until the next will not fit and states how many it
  answered, in order; the client asks again for the remainder. No bound moves
  for this (§24.4): `FONT_MAX_GLYPH_REPLY` is re-derived as the batch header
  plus one widest, tallest record, and the coverage/width/height bounds it
  rests on are untouched. The fill rule lives once, in `font_ipc`'s
  `GlyphBatchWriter`, beside the decoder that enforces the same bound. A
  scalar the faces cannot yield truncates the batch exactly as a full frame
  does; only a failure on the first scalar is a status-word error frame.
  - **The work one request can force is still bounded by the reply, not by
    the run length.** The service stops rasterising the moment a record will
    not fit, so a request produces at most the frame's worth of coverage plus
    the one glyph that overflowed it — no more than twice the old per-request
    ceiling, where a per-glyph protocol let a client ask 32 times for the same
    total anyway. The run length does not multiply it.
  - Only the *client* knows how long the run it sent was, since the reply
    bound admits a batch as long as any run, so the client refuses a batch
    answering more than it asked for rather than reading it down to size
    (§5.4).
- **No new capability** (§5.2): drawing text is not a security boundary, so
  the endpoint is callable by any process (the *action* still validates every
  field and fails closed). The service holds the only privileged thing — the
  `/System/Fonts` read authority — and only at startup.

### 2.3 `lib/font` becomes the thin client (+ protocol reuse)

`lib/font` is the drawing front end every surface uses:

- A `BitmapFont` is a `(family, pixel height, weight)` triple. It sends a
  `FONT_ENDPOINT` request and blits the returned coverage, caching replies
  locally per `(family, scalar, height, weight)` in the byte-budgeted cache
  of §3.1, so steady-state redraws issue no IPC. Line metrics are fetched
  once per `(family, height, weight)` and cached beside them; with no
  transport installed they fall back to the compiled-in console geometry, so
  a dead service degrades to unrendered text rather than broken layout.
- **One warm step serves both entry points.** `FontClient::warm` scans a run
  for the scalars the cache does not hold (peeked, so recency stays the
  drawing lookup's) and fetches them a bounded run at a time, re-asking for
  whatever a reply's frame could not carry. Both the measurement walk
  (`measure_text`, which drives `text_width`, `truncate_to_width` and
  `elide_to_width`) and `draw_text` go through it, because both missed per
  glyph. There is no second cache: the coverage fetched while measuring is
  what the draw then blits. Warming is skipped with no cache installed and
  abandoned after one batch the cache kept nothing of, so the §3.2 admits-
  nothing state pays no batch on top of the per-glyph call it already pays.
- Layout is **per-glyph**: `text_width`, `truncate_to_width`, and
  `draw_text` accumulate each glyph's own advance and place it at its own
  bearing. A monospace family keeps a fast path over its single advance, so
  the terminal grid pays no per-glyph arithmetic, and its glyphs arrive
  already *in* the cell — one cell wide, two for a double-width scalar, with
  a zero bearing — so a grid blits them at the cell origin.
- No TrueType bytes and no outline rasteriser live in the crate: only the
  compiled-in console atlas (§2.4) the boot console draws from.
- Protocol request/reply encoders live in `lib/abi::font_ipc` and are shared
  by client and service (§2.2), never re-spelled.

### 2.4 Kernel console atlas subset (`lib/fbcon` / kernel path)

The framebuffer text console cannot call a service (boot floor), so it keeps a
**compiled-in console atlas** covering the whole console family: the primary
Inconsolata EX repertoire (ASCII, Latin-1, Latin Extended, Greek, Cyrillic,
box drawing, arrows, punctuation, currency, U+FFFD; single-cell) plus the
Japanese, Korean and Hebrew companions (full-width scalars occupying a lead
and a continuation cell). It is generated by `cargo xtask font-atlas --write`
into the `lib/font/src/atlas.rs` + `atlas_coverage.bin` the kernel path
embeds.

The generator never names a face: it reads the `mono` family's `FontFamily`
manifest through the same `tools/xtask` store reader that plants
`/System/Fonts`, so the console's faces, the shipped store's faces and the
service's faces are one list (§2.2). The atlas is the console's fixed-cell
*view* of those faces rather than a second copy of them, and it shares the
`lib/fontface` engine with the service's runtime rasterisation, so there is
exactly one source of truth.

The committed faces carry no TrueType hinting bytecode, so that engine
grid-fits every outline itself before filling it (`lib/fontface`'s `gridfit`):
strokes snap to whole pixels, never narrower than one, and rows snap to the
face's own baseline / x-height / cap-height / ascender / descender zones so a
line of text agrees on them; a stroke between zones is placed between their
rows, and bars near the face's standard thickness share its width. Columns are snapped only on the fixed-cell path —
the atlas, and the service whenever a *monospace* family asks for its cell —
where the cell owns the advance and moving a stem costs no spacing; the
proportional path fits rows alone so ink stays under the advance the client
laid out with.
Without it the console atlas put under a tenth of its ink at full coverage at
the 8×16 cell — every stem two columns of grey.

Box Drawing and Block Elements are not rasterised at all. They exist to tile,
which an outline manages only where its hairlines land on pixel boundaries, so
`lib/fontface`'s `lineart` draws them as whole pixels computed from the cell.
Both sources of a grid's glyphs use it — the atlas here, and the service when a
monospace family asks for a cell — so a border is the same picture on the
framebuffer console and in a terminal window.

### 2.5 `/System/Fonts` — the one on-disk font store

The store is a directory per family, planted verbatim from
`lib/font/assets/<family>/` by the image pipeline (`tools/mkimage` +
`tools/xtask`), read-only within the read-only `/System` (§16.2). A
directory is a family exactly when it carries a `FontFamily` manifest
(`lib/fontface`'s `store` module parses it on both the build and the service
side, so the two can never disagree):

```
/System/Fonts/<key>/FontFamily     label, kind, ordered faces, fallback key
/System/Fonts/<key>/<face>.ttf     the faces that manifest lists
```

`kind` is `proportional`, `monospace`, or `fallback`; a fallback family is
coverage only and is never offered to a user, which is how the three
proportional families share one set of Hebrew and CJK faces instead of
embedding three copies. Resolution is by order alone — the primary face owns
Latin, and a companion is reached only for what the primary does not map —
so there is no per-face script table to keep in step with the faces.

No atlas artifact is planted: `fontd` derives everything from the faces.
Adding a family is dropping its directory into `lib/font/assets/`; nothing
in the kernel, the service, or the image builder names a face.

`fontd` scans the store at startup and reads only the manifests — kilobytes.
A face's bytes are read on first use through the read-only handle opened
then, so a session that never draws Chinese never pays for the 17 MB
Chinese face, and a machine with little RAM is not charged for coverage it
is not using. The service uses its `CAP_FS_ACCESS` only against the store,
and `/System` is read-only so the reach can never write (minimum authority,
§19.5, §5.4).

### 2.6 Secondary defect — shippable image ships debug userland

`build_platform_image` builds the kernel with the Cargo profile matching the
image profile (`kernel_build_profile`: `installer`→`--release`,
`debug`→debug), but the app/driver `Run` binaries always go through
`pie_build::cross_compile_pie_elf`, which is hardcoded to the **debug**
profile. So the shippable `installer` image ships an optimised kernel beside
unoptimised userland/drivers. Thread the image profile through
`cross_compile_pie_elf` (mirroring `kernel_build_profile`) so `installer`
ships release-built userland/drivers, `debug` stays debug, and QEMU
integration-test images stay debug (fast iteration). This is independent of
the font work and is fixed in its own step.

### 2.7 Variable faces and real weights

The shipped faces are upstream **variable** fonts, committed unmodified.
`lib/fontface` instantiates a design-axis coordinate at parse time
(`fvar`/`avar` normalisation, `gvar` tuple deltas with IUP, `HVAR` advance
variations), so `FontWeight` renders the weight the type designer drew
rather than a synthesised approximation, and the advance changes with it as
it should. A face with no `wght` axis is thickened instead by the service's
bounded sub-pixel stroke, which leaves its advance alone. This is why the
store ships one file per family rather than one per weight, and why a
family's manifest names no weights.

---

## 3. Status — done

The migration is complete: the ~10 MB font payload no longer lives in any app.
`/System/Fonts` holds one directory per family — `inter`, `noto-sans`,
`noto-serif`, the `mono` console family, and the shared `sans-fallback`
coverage set — discovered at startup; `fontd` is the only process that parses a
face or runs the outline rasteriser, and every other process draws through the
thin `lib/font` client over `FONT_ENDPOINT`.

Load-bearing facts a future reader needs:

- **Protocol** (`lib/abi/src/font_ipc.rs`, `FONT_ENDPOINT = 0x464E_5400`,
  registered in `is_reserved_endpoint` as a privileged bind). A fixed 164-byte
  `FontRequest` — `Glyphs { family, scalars: GlyphRun, pixel_height, weight }`
  / `Metrics { family, pixel_height, weight }` / `Families`, the family a
  validated `FamilyKey` and the scalars `char`s so a stray byte or a surrogate
  is unrepresentable, the weight a closed `FontWeight` decoded from its wire
  value — and a status-framed reply: a glyph batch (the answered count, then
  that many `width`, `height`, `advance`, `left`, `width*height` 8-bit-sample
  records, the whole frame bounded by `FONT_MAX_GLYPH_REPLY`; `width == 0` is
  an ink-less glyph), the `FontMetrics { pixel_height, baseline, line_height,
  monospace_advance }` (where `monospace_advance == 0` *means* proportional),
  or up to `FONT_MAX_FAMILIES` `FamilyEntry` (key, label, kind) rows. One
  shared `glyph_coverage_len` bound governs encode and decode. Pixel height is
  bounded by `FONT_MIN/MAX_PIXEL_HEIGHT` (8..=512) and the run by
  `FONT_MAX_GLYPH_RUN` (32) — validation bounds. `GlyphBatchWriter` is the one
  fill-until-full rule both sides agree on, and a successful batch answers at
  least one glyph so a client walking a run always progresses. Not part of the
  curated C-ABI surface, so the generated C headers carry no font view. The
  request/reply decoders and `GlyphRun`'s own bound are in the `fuzz_decode`
  harness; the `lib/fontface` TrueType parser has its own `tests/fuzz_face.rs`.
- **Console atlas** (`lib/font/src/atlas.rs` + `atlas_coverage.bin`,
  regenerated by `cargo xtask font-atlas --write` from the whole `mono` family,
  §1.1/§2.4). Every face the family lists is compiled in — 23,602 cells in
  1.6 MB at the 8×16 cell — because the console runs in the kernel and cannot
  ask this service for a glyph, so a face left out is a script no console could
  ever draw. `lib/fbcon` and the render client's const-fn geometry read it; only
  a scalar no face maps shows U+FFFD. There is no precomputed full-Unicode
  atlas artifact.
- **Service** (`userland/system/fontd`, `/System/Services/fontd.app`). A dual
  library + `Run`-binary crate modelled on `sysinfod`. `discovery::discover`
  scans the store through the injected `FontStore`/`FaceLoad` seams (bounded to
  `FONT_MAX_FAMILIES`, sorted by key, a malformed family skipped with a
  `FAMILY_SKIPPED` warning, an empty store fatal), so the whole
  discovery-to-serve pipeline is host-tested from an in-memory fixture. The
  host-testable `FontService` dispatcher owns those families, their lazily-read
  faces and per-weight parsed instances, and a byte-budgeted `(requesting
  family, resolved family, face, glyph, pixel height, cells, weight)` glyph
  cache (§3.1) — both families in the key because two families sharing a
  fallback face rasterise it at their own primary face's geometry, and the cell
  count because a face maps every scalar it does not cover onto one replacement
  glyph, so without it a double-width scalar's two-cell bitmap would be served
  for a single-width one. It resolves a scalar
  through the family's own faces, then its fallback family's, then U+FFFD;
  rasterises through the shared `lib/fontface` engine at the primary face's
  geometry (4-bit `×17` → the protocol's 8-bit samples) so a run shares one
  baseline and box height; and always emits a reply (status-word error frame on
  failure, fail closed — an unknown family key is `NotFound`, never a
  substitution). The `Run` binary serves from a wait set carrying both
  `FONT_ENDPOINT` and the kernel's `MemoryPressure` system notice, so it
  reacts to a band change while idle without polling either. Its manifest
  requests `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`, `CAP_FS_ACCESS` (the manifest scan and
  the first-use face reads through the secured VFS — `fs_open` is
  capability-gated regardless of the file's mode; `/System` is read-only so no
  write reach), and `CAP_LOG_EMIT`, and the `fontd` service account (uid 15,
  `FONTD_CEILING`) grants exactly those three.
- **Weights.** A face declaring a `wght` axis is instanced at the requested
  weight's OpenType coordinate — any point on the axis; the desktop's roles
  ask for their named weights set `lib/theme`'s `TEXT_WEIGHT_LIFT` heavier —
  and cached per (face, weight), so the glyph *and* its advance are the ones
  the designer drew (§2.7). Only a face without that axis falls to the
  synthetic stroke (`userland/system/fontd/src/embolden.rs`): zero at Regular,
  rising linearly to em/24 at Bold (§3.3) — the strength a stroke-widening
  rasteriser applies for a synthetic bold, as FreeType's
  `FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden` does — carried in 1/256 px fixed point and applied
  to the 8-bit coverage, never the outline. That stroke is
  **horizontal only**, so the baseline, box height, and pen advance are
  unchanged and a synthetic bold run occupies exactly what its regular twin
  would; `Regular` adds a zero stroke.
- **Client** (`lib/font`, `render` feature). `BitmapFont` is a thin cached
  `FONT_ENDPOINT` client with the same public API; the four TTF embeds
  (`cache.rs`) and the full atlas are deleted. The transport is a
  process-global `FontTransport` seam: real programs link `tairix-font/rt`
  (routing through `tairix_rt::ipc_call`), host tests install a mock, and with
  no transport a draw fails closed. Its glyph cache (§3.1) is installed
  through the parallel `set_glyph_cache` seam and defaults lazily under `rt`.
  GUI `Run` images no longer carry the ~10 MB `R` LOAD segment. `warm` (§2.3)
  is the one fetch step both the measurement walk and `draw_text` reach the
  service through, so a cold run is one round trip and a warm one is none;
  `fetch_glyphs` is the only wire fetch, and a single-glyph miss is a run of
  one.
- **Image + discovery.** `image_apps::system_font_files` plants every family
  directory under `lib/font/assets/` — its `FontFamily` manifest and exactly
  the faces that manifest names — at `/System/Fonts/<key>/` in the shared
  `app_store_files` (discovered from the assets tree, never a list), and
  `fontd.app` is auto-discovered under `/System/Services`. `fontd` is **not** a
  boot-floor service: text rendering is a graphics-only resource, so PID 1
  *registers* it on-demand (`init`'s `DEFAULT_CONFIG` names it with the
  `ondemand` directive) and starts nothing. The service manager activates it
  the first time a client asks to connect, and idle-stops it when the last
  client has gone (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-4/SVC-5). Nothing on a
  headless or text-only machine ever asks, so nothing ever starts it — the
  headless guarantee is structural rather than a condition somebody has to
  assert.
  The client half of that handshake is in `lib/font` alone: it connects
  through the activation endpoint before its first request, and the manager
  holds the call until `fontd` announces (over the lifecycle-notice endpoint)
  that it has bound `FONT_ENDPOINT`. So a consumer can no longer reach the
  endpoint before it exists — the race that made `lib/svg` refuse a whole
  document for want of a service that was merely late.
  The manager resolves the path through the ordinary program gate: the
  on-disk `/System/Services` bundle on aarch64, and the compiled-in program
  registry (`spawn_paths::FONTD_PATH`, `program_manifests::FONTD_MANIFEST`,
  `spawn_layout::SPAWN_PROGRAMS`, `build.rs`) on x86_64/riscv64 until their
  storage floors land. That registry row is those ports' whole boot floor —
  every service and command app is in it — so it is not `fontd`'s to remove;
  it goes when the table does (`plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md`). An earlier worry that
  a 5th concurrent boot service crashed the kernel (D18) was investigated and
  closed non-reproducing once this service's ~10 MB payload was removed
  (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`).
- **Profile fix (§2.6).** The image → Cargo-profile mapping lives once on
  `tairix_mkimage::ImageProfile`; both `kernel_build_profile` and
  `pie_build::cross_compile_pie_elf` read it, so `installer` cross-compiles
  userland/driver `Run` binaries `--release` while `debug`/QEMU images stay
  `dev`. Every `(arch, profile)` bundle memo in `image_apps`/`image_drivers` is
  re-keyed through the shared `memo_slot`.

### 3.1 The one glyph-cache declaration (both sides of the endpoint)

The client's memoised replies and the service's memoised rasters are the same
kind of memory, so they are **one declaration**, in `lib/font/src/glyph_cache.rs`
(feature `glyph-cache`, pulled in by `render`; `fontd` depends on that feature
alone, so it takes none of the drawing dependencies):

- `CachedGlyph` — the retained value (`width`, `height`, `advance`, `left`,
  owned coverage) and its `CachedBytes` impl: payload is the coverage length,
  `wipe` zeroes it.
- `glyph_cache_candidate(owner)` — class `DisposableUi`, `RebuildCost::Expensive`,
  `Sensitivity::UserData` (so every released entry is overwritten — the set of
  cached glyphs reveals which characters a user has had displayed),
  `InvalidationSource::OwnerTeardown`, `ReclaimRule::Drop`.
- `glyph_cache_budget(total_ram_bytes)` — `CacheBudget::from_ceiling(total /
  4096)`. A glyph working set is a few hundred bitmaps, so this is deliberately
  far below the 1/16th a kernel-heap-backed cache takes: 256 KiB on a 1 GiB
  machine, 16 MiB on a 64 GiB one. **Zero total RAM yields a zero budget**,
  which admits nothing and leaves everything served uncached — correct, merely
  slower, never a hand-picked fallback.

Each side builds its own `tairix_reclaim::ReclaimCache` from that declaration
with its own key (the client's `(scalar, family, pixel height, weight)`, the
service's `(requesting family, resolved family, face, glyph, pixel height,
cells, weight)`) and a `()` generation, since nothing invalidates a glyph while the
faces are loaded. Both are owned by `ReclaimOwner::UserlandProcess`
(`"font-client"` / `"fontd"`), the variant for a cache that cannot resolve a
numeric task id.

Why this matters on the service side: the pixel height is **caller-supplied**,
and the widest permitted bitmap is `FONT_MAX_GLYPH_WIDTH ×
FONT_MAX_PIXEL_HEIGHT` (512 KiB), so an entry-counted bound was a byte bound in
the hundreds of megabytes a hostile client could walk it up to. The byte budget
closes that; the protocol's own size validation (§2.2) is a separate, unchanged
security bound and is what refuses an out-of-range request in the first place.

### 3.2 The client cache only works if the process knows its band

`ReportedPressure` starts at `PressureBand::Critical` and `growth_permitted`
is true only at `Normal`, so a client process that never publishes a band
admits **nothing**: every character drawn becomes one `FONT_ENDPOINT` round
trip, for the life of that process, and `fontd` carries the whole desktop's
per-glyph traffic. That is a silent hundredfold cost, not a degraded cache, so
the wiring is load-bearing and is defined once rather than per program:

- `tairix_procinfo::pressure` is the single definition. `watch(set, token)`
  adds the `MemoryPressure` notice member **and** primes the gauge with the
  band in force (the wake reports only *changes*, so neither half works
  alone); `refresh()` re-reads on the wake and reports whether it moved. Its
  `publish_depth(depth, gauge)` core is host-tested.
- Every `Run` binary that links `tairix-font/rt` arms it — `files`,
  `terminal`, `viewer`, `wallpaper`, `widgets`, `switchboard`, and the desktop
  `session` (which hosts the compositor's and taskbar's caches too) — and on
  the wake calls `tairix_font::trim_glyph_cache()` alongside its own caches,
  so glyph memory is returned when the band moves rather than at the next
  draw. `fontd` arms the same member for its service-side cache.
- `lib/font`'s lazy `rt` cache constructor primes the band in the same breath
  as its RAM read, so a cache is never *born* against the fail-closed unknown
  band even before its program's loop is up.

## 3.2 Open — the glyph rasteriser is a second coverage implementation

`lib/fontface`'s engine computes glyph coverage itself, by probing four
sample rows per pixel row, rather than through `lib/raster`'s scan converter —
which now computes the *exact* covered area of every pixel and is what every
other vector asset in the tree fills through. Two consequences, both open:

- It is a second coverage implementation of the one problem, which the charter
  forbids duplicating. Collapsing it means giving the shared converter a way to
  hand back coverage rows for a caller that wants a mask rather than a
  composite; the grid fitting and stem alignment above it stay where they are.
- Until then a glyph's edges carry only 17 coverage levels. Grid fitting hides
  most of that — a fitted stem lands on whole pixels — but a diagonal or a
  curve still quantises where an icon drawn through the shared converter no
  longer does.

The work is its own change: the fitted-outline path needs a design and test
pass of its own, and must keep grid fitting's whole-pixel stems intact.

## 3.3 Done — the endpoint serves outlines as well as coverage

`FONT_ENDPOINT` now answers geometry: `FontRequest::Outlines` hands back a
bounded run of glyphs as closed contours in the resolved face's own font
units, decoded by the same `glyf` walk the rasteriser uses. `lib/svg`'s text
(`plans/SVG.md` S23/S24) draws through it.

**Handing the caller the face bytes was refused.** It would put an untrusted
TrueType parser back into every consumer — the §19.5 defect this plan exists
to remove — and re-duplicate a parse that already has one home (§2.2). The
two objections this section raised against a contour reply both answered
with measurement rather than a compromise:

- **Byte budget.** A worst-case record is
  `20 + 12·contours + 20·segments` with `contours + segments ≤
  FONT_MAX_OUTLINE_POINTS` (8192), so `FONT_MAX_OUTLINE_REPLY` is 163,876 B —
  under a third of the existing `FONT_MAX_GLYPH_REPLY` (524,312). No client
  receive buffer grew and no existing bound moved (§24.4).
- **Round trips.** The outline op is per **run**, reusing the coverage
  path's prefix-batch rule verbatim: one round trip per run, not per glyph.
  The fill rule itself is now factored out of `GlyphBatchWriter`, so the two
  batch kinds cannot come to disagree about what a well-formed prefix reply
  looks like.

Load-bearing facts a future reader needs:

- **No pixel height on the request.** A drawing has no resolution, so the
  height field is the one that operation does not use and must be zero.
  Coordinates are **26.6 fixed-point font units**, which makes NaN and
  infinity unrepresentable rather than merely checked for.
- **`units_per_em` and the synthesis travel per *record*.** A per-scalar
  fallback crosses faces, and two faces of one family need share neither an
  em nor a `wght` axis — which the coverage protocol hides by answering in
  pixels and an outline protocol cannot. The batch *header* carries the
  requested family's primary-face em, ascent, descent and line gap, which is
  what a run's baseline and line box are measured in.
- **`Synthesis` states what the face could not furnish**, so the caller
  completes it exactly rather than being served an upright regular in
  silence: an em-relative bold stroke width and an oblique shear (the shear
  rather than the angle, because a shear is what a caller applies and an
  angle is what every caller would then have to convert identically). The
  bold figure comes from the *same* ramp `embolden` applies to coverage, so
  a bold drawn as pixels and one drawn as geometry are the same weight.
- **`FontWeight` is a number, not a keyword set.** Every variable face
  carries `wght 100..900` and CSS writes `font-weight: 250`; rendering that
  as 400 is a wrong picture. It is a validated newtype over `1..=1000` with
  `REGULAR`/`MEDIUM`/`BOLD` associated constants — one type, one wire field.
  `FontStyle` and `FontStretch` join it on the outline request alone: the
  coverage path draws neither, so a frame carrying one there is refused.
  `embolden`'s synthetic stroke is now a linear ramp in the axis distance
  above Regular reaching em/24 at Bold, rather than a table of three.
- **A generic family resolves at the service**, which is the thing that
  knows the store: an installed family of that exact key first, then the
  first family *claiming* that generic in its own `FontFamily` manifest
  (`generic = serif` beside `kind`), then the first claiming `sans-serif`,
  then the first selectable family at all. A concrete name the store does
  not hold is **not** substituted, so a document can try the next family it
  listed. A fallback-role family claiming a generic is a malformed manifest,
  since a user never selects one.
- **Client** (`lib/font`). `outline_run` is the fetch, memoised per
  `(family, scalar, weight, style, stretch)` in an outline cache declared
  beside the coverage one (§3.1's classification, its own budget from the
  same RAM-derived ceiling) and trimmed by the same `trim_glyph_cache`.
  `ServiceFonts` (feature `svg`) is the one adapter between `lib/svg`'s seam
  and this endpoint; a face is selected by asking for one probe glyph, whose
  reply header *is* the family's font-unit geometry.
- **The build verifies icons through this same service.** `tools/xtask`'s
  `host_fonts` drives the real `FontService` over the committed
  `lib/font/assets/` tree through the `FontStore`/`FaceLoad` seams it
  already has for host testing, so an icon the build admits is one the
  running desktop can draw.
- **A QEMU vertical attests the sandboxed consumer.** The build check above
  and the host tests both stop at the pipe, so
  `tests/integration/svgtext_qemu_aarch64` runs the two-round exchange on a
  booted machine: a capability-empty decoder records what it cannot answer,
  a parent fetches it here, and the second decode draws it. It measures the
  pixels rather than witnessing a marker — two drawings differing in one
  character must ink differently, and the same drawing with no seam must be
  refused (`plans/SVG.md`).
