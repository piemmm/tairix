# NEW-MENUS — every menu is the desktop's: one chain, one grab, one renderer

Binding under `AGENTS.md` (§3, §15.18).

## Ledger

| Stage | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Row model (`AppMenu`) + the icon-bar declaration carrying it | **landed** |
| M1a | Variable-length request framing: per-op wire length, exact-length decode | **landed** |
| M1b | Model: per-plate rows, submenu depth, titles, shortcuts, `About`→`Info` | **landed** |
| M1c | The per-gesture open: anchor in, `Chosen`/`Dismissed`/`Refused` out | **landed** |
| M1d | ~~Attached-window row kind~~ — deleted in M3.4 (D19) | **superseded** |
| M2 | The service: bands, drag, arrival-open, attach/detach, grab, lifetime | **landed** |
| M3.1 | Migrate `userland/apps/terminal`, delete its shell | **landed** |
| M3.2 | Migrate the pinboard backdrop menu, delete its shell | **landed** |
| M3.3 | Migrate `userland/apps/files`, delete its shell | **landed** |
| M3.4 | Migrate the bar's four menu subjects, delete `BarMenu` | **landed** |
| M3.5 | ~~The bar's start menu~~ — **not in scope** (decision 3) | **settled** |
| M4 | Plate as a cached damage-reporting surface | **landed** |
| M5 | Plates are floating chrome: 80% opacity over the shared chrome blur | **landed** |
| M6 | A row may act *and* open a child: quick-entry fields, candidate submenus with their own icons | **landed** |

Open decisions: none. Decision 4 is **settled** by the owner — floating chrome
moves to 80% opacity as one shared value, and the blur stays the one the
right-hand icon-bar surfaces already use; landed as M5.
Decision 1 is **settled** — variable-length framing, landed
as M1a. Decision 2 is **reversed** by the owner and superseded by M6: Open
With… is a row that *both* concludes the chain and opens a submenu of the
applications that claim the file. Decision 3 stands, on the one of its two
reasons that survives M6: a plate does not scroll, and the program-library
popup is a list as long as what a user has installed. Its other reason — that
a plate takes no text — is no longer true, and the text below says so.

### Defects found, to fix in the stage named

Found while doing the work above; each is owned here until it lands, and the
stage that closes it carries its regression test (§2.18, §7).

| # | Defect | Fix in |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | `WindowRequest::from_bytes` accepted a frame longer than the op needs, checking only that the tail was zero. Exact-length framing refuses any trailing byte instead. | **closed in M1a** |
| D2 | The per-op operand-block end offsets were spelled twice — once implicitly by the encoder, once as a literal in the decoder's `reserved_zero(bytes, 36)` call. One named length per op now serves both (§2.2). | **closed in M1a** |
| D3 | Exact-length decoding refuses a random-length input before it reaches any operand, so the request decoders' fuzz coverage came to rest on the seeded frames — and only `SetAppBar` had one. `fuzz_decode` now seeds and bit-flips one frame per operation, at its length and one byte either side. | **closed in M1a** |
| D4 | Menu-child placement existed twice with two rules: `lib/controls`' `Menu::anchored_rect` slides a plate onto the screen, while the bar's own `child_rect` flips a child to its parent's other side. A root at a pointer and a child beside its parent legitimately differ, but the two rules must end up as one owner's (§2.2) rather than one shared and one private to the bar. M1c's wire anchor is a *region* precisely so one rule can serve both: a slot-anchored bar menu and an app's context menu differ only in whether that region has an extent. **One rule now**: `plate_rect(size, anchor, side, gap, viewport)` bounds the plate to the viewport, opens edge-adjacent on the asked-for side, flips when that side has no room (roomier side when neither does), then slides the cross axis and clamps. `Menu::anchored_rect` is its point case and the bar's `child_rect` is deleted. Placement is now *flip*-then-slide where a context menu used to slide only, which also keeps the press point at a corner of the plate rather than inside it. | **closed in M2** |
| D5 | `AppMenu::push_under` refused a submenu inside a submenu, so the model could not express a chain at all — the one-level bound was load-bearing in the builder, not only in the renderer. Nesting is now bounded by `APP_MENU_MAX_DEPTH` instead, and a submenu on the deepest plate is refused rather than drawn opening nothing. | **closed in M1b** |
| D6 | A row's text was a widest-case buffer per row, so the three fields a declared row carries (label, accelerator caption, refusal reason) would have multiplied by the row bound — and `WindowRequest` carries a menu inline, so the hot `Present` path's own frame would have grown with them. A menu now holds its rows' text in one bounded block (`APP_MENU_TEXT_BYTES`) and the wire carries lengths, not offsets, in row order. | **closed in M1b** |
| D7 | `lib/window`'s client encoded every request into a fresh `MAX_WIRE_LEN` stack array and the session's serve loop received into one, so both cleared the widest operation's width on every call — including the hot `Present`. M1a made the *frame* per-operation but left these two buffers at the ceiling. Each is now held once for the life of the connection. | **closed in M1b** |
| D8 | The bar built a child plate's rows without folding a declared separator into the next row's group break, so a separator inside a declared submenu drew as a blank disabled row where the same separator on the root plate drew a divider. One `plate_rows` builder now serves both. | **closed in M1b** |
| D9 | The model describes a chain `APP_MENU_MAX_DEPTH` plates deep; the bar renders one level, so a submenu declared *inside* a submenu draws its chevron and opens nothing. Nothing in the tree declares one (`appbar::declaration` refuses a submenu outright), and the chain renderer is what M2 is. **Closed**: the chain opens a plate per level to `APP_MENU_MAX_DEPTH`, each placed against its own parent. | **closed in M2** |
| D11 | The frame-layout block every surface-opening request shares ended at the literal `41`, spelled three times over (`RESIZE_WIRE_LEN`, `POPUP_PARENT_OFFSET`, `CREATE_TITLE_LEN_OFFSET`) with its field offsets spelled again inside the codec — D2's shape a second time, and a fourth operation was about to join it. One `FRAME_LAYOUT_AT`/`FRAME_LAYOUT_END` now says where the block is and how wide, and every operation that puts operands after it derives its own offsets. | **closed in M1d** |
| D12 | Three requests open a surface and each wrote the same prologue longhand — the granted region, the event route, the frame layout. One `write_surface_operands` now writes it for all of them (§2.2). | **closed in M1d** |
| D13 | `WindowClient` remembers each window's extent and last presented frame to answer a redraw, and pruned that record only in its own `close`. The **session** ends an attached window with its chain, so a client using panels would have kept one record per gesture — unbounded growth on a list every `present` linearly scans. The client now settles its records on a chain's outcome, by the one shared `MenuOutcome::detaches` rule the desktop settles by, and `close` forgets a window even when the session no longer knows it. | **closed in M1d** |
| D14 | The shared `Menu` maps *any* chevroned row's activation to `OpenSubmenu`, so it could not tell a panel row's click — which detached its window — from a submenu row's, which opens a plate. Resolved by layer rather than by widening the control: `Menu` owns rows and chevrons, and the chain owned panel semantics. Moot since D19 deleted the panel row: every chevroned row now opens its child. | **closed in M2** |
| D15 | `MenuChain::render_plate` drew its rows through `Menu::render`, which lays a **complete** plate of its own — rim, rounded corners and ground. The chain had already laid one for the band and the rows together, so every plate carried the Signal Rim twice and the rows' own rounded top corners notched the outer ground just under the band. Resolved by layer, not by a flag: `Menu` gained `render_rows`, which paints rows into a plate someone else laid, and `render` is now that plus the plate. Row geometry is unchanged — both land exactly where `row_rect` reports — so hit-testing never disagreed with drawing and only the extra rim was ever visible. | **closed in M3.1** |
| D16 | The terminal assigned a freshly-opened settings sheet straight over `TerminalWindow::overlay`, so an assignment that found one already there would drop it without calling `close` — leaving a session-side popup window on screen with nothing owning it. `set_overlay` made the assignment unable to leak. **The open question is answered: it was a *live* leak, not a latent one.** A key does reach a parent whose popup is up — not by focusing its decoration, which gives the keyboard to the *furniture* and swallows the key, but through the bar's hover window picker: `raise_window` → `TaskBridge::raise` → `router.focus` moved focus to the parent with no client press, so nothing dismissed the sheet and the next `Ctrl ,` ran `Command::Settings` behind it. That focus move is itself the defect (D18) and is fixed there, which is where the regression test lives; `set_overlay` stays as the guard, now unreachable by construction rather than argued safe. | **closed in M3.2** (cause is D18) |
| D17 | **No QEMU vertical opened a menu**, so the chain's drain, grab and answer paths in `userland/gui/session/src/run.rs` — and the terminal's own open/answer path — were exercised by nothing, and no one had ever seen a plate on screen. **Closed**: the session now announces `MENU_SHOWN` ("menu chain on screen", `EventId(20_006)`) beside `WINDOW_SHOWN`, once per open and only after a frame carrying the chain reached the display — the only honest gate, since the reply an application gets says the open was *accepted*, never that a plate was drawn. `tests/integration/menu_qemu_aarch64` then launches the terminal from the program library, right-clicks its client, photographs the plate at the rectangle the production chain reports, and clicks its *Settings…* row; the guest latches `APP_LOADED` for the bundle, the 12-byte minted-id reply only `OpenMenu` produces, and a create observed *after* it — the sheet the chosen row opens, which the terminal opens on nothing but the one `MenuClosed` naming that row. | **closed in M3.2** |
| D18 | Raising a window gave the keyboard to *that* window even when its own live transient sat above it. A raise brings a window's transients up with it (`Compositor::raise` restacks the family), so `show_raise_focus` — the one path `TaskBridge::open` and `TaskBridge::raise` share — left the focused window *underneath* its own modal sheet: the bar's hover window picker could focus a terminal behind its open settings sheet, with no client press to dismiss it, and the next accelerator ran in the client instead of the sheet. That is the route that made D16 live. **Fixed** by focusing the front of the family that rose (`Compositor::family_front`, one rule shared with `family_top`); a window with no transient open is its own family front, so the ordinary case is unchanged. | **closed in M3.2** |
| D19 | `AppMenuRow::Panel`, `WindowRequest::CreateMenuPanel` and `WindowEvent::MenuPanelRequested` had **no production client** — only a fuzz seed declared a panel row. M1d landed the attached window for the shape decision 2 turned out not to want. **Closed by deletion.** None of the bar's four subjects is its client, and the reason is structural rather than a judgement: an attached window is a surface the *owning application* draws, and a bar chain's owner is the desktop itself, so there is no client to ask. A presentation child the desktop would draw itself — a calendar under the clock — is the `Info` row's kind, not this one's. So the row kind, its `AppMenuRowView` and `RowKind` cases, `APP_MENU_KIND_PANEL`, `APP_MENU_PANEL_MAX_PX`, `WindowRequest::CreateMenuPanel`, `WindowEvent::MenuPanelRequested`, `MenuOutcome::detaches`, `WindowHost::menu_panel_opened`, `MenuPanelSpec`, the engine's `MenuAttachment` lifetime and `close_menu_panel`, `WindowClient::create_menu_panel`/`settle_menu_chain`, the chain's `ChainChild::Panel`/`Attached`/`place_panel`/`PanelRefused`/`SurfaceKind::Attached`/`ChainAction::RequestPanel`, and the fuzz seed are all gone. `deliver_event` lost the `host` parameter M1d gave it for the teardown, and §1.4 collapses to the one child a chain hangs: the desktop-drawn information panel. | **closed in M3.4** |
| D20 | The chain holds the seat's grab, so a press outside it is consumed and never delivered — which makes the second press of `files.app`'s FM12 **right-double-click** ("activate, then close this window") structurally unreachable the moment its first press opens a desktop menu. Not an implementation cost: an application deliberately cannot see a press inside chrome it does not own. **Resolved by re-spelling the capability rather than dropping it**: `ContextCommand::OpenAndClose` carries the same `AfterHandoff::CloseWindow` activation as a menu row — discoverable, and reachable from the keyboard, which the gesture never was — and `gesture.rs`'s `secondary_press`/`SecondaryPress`/`MenuOnSingle` are deleted with the gesture. A right-press still breaks a half-finished left pair (the app resets the tracker). | **closed in M3.3** |
| D21 | Threading the chain through `files.app` grew three of its routers (`apply_event`, `apply_nav_event`, `apply_pointer`) past the argument threshold, so each carried a justified `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`. **Closed**: one bundle per side — `WindowState` for what a round acts *on* (browser, overlays, places) and `Acts` for what it acts *through* (the menu link, the launcher). All three routers are back under the threshold and all three allows are gone. | **closed in M3.4** |
| D22 | The one-based `index ↔ AppMenuItemId` numbering every command-list menu uses was spelled twice — `lib/browse::chrome`'s `row_id`/`context_command_from_item` and `session::pinboard`'s `PinboardCommand::row_id`/`from_item` — and M3.4 needed it a third time for the bar's three table-driven menus. **Closed**: `AppMenuItemId::for_index` / `AppMenuItemId::index` are the one definition, beside the id type whose non-zero invariant is the reason the numbering is one-based at all. | **closed in M3.4** |
| D23 | The bar's own menus were reachable only through the bar: no host test could open one *and* read its answer back, because the plate and the grab were the bar's own shell and the answer never left it. Migrating them made the round trip host-testable in two halves — the model and the id→response inverse in the taskbar suite, the plate, grab and one answer in the session suite (`choose_bar_menu_row` drives the whole path the serve loop drives). The end-to-end wiring stays witnessed by the two QEMU verticals that already click a bar menu row: `appbar_qemu_aarch64` (a slot's declared *New window*) and `datetime_elevate_qemu_aarch64` (the clock's *Set Date & Time…*), both of which now pass only if the chain path is right. | **closed in M3.4** |
| D10 | The bar's own menus state two things the model cannot carry: a row denied for want of a capability (`AuthorityState::NeedsCapability`, which draws an Authority Mark rather than merely greying) and a row whose setting is already in effect (`ActivityState::Complete`). **Answered.** The Authority Mark says *the system* refused a command, and only the system may say it, so it is in-process-only — and structurally, not by a check: the wire model has no field for an authority state, so a decoded row is always `Allowed` and an application cannot paint the mark on its own row. §1.6's "bounded subset" means an absent field, never a validated one. `ActivityState::Complete` ("work finished successfully") is a *misuse* on an appearance row and is deleted rather than carried: the alternatives are a radio group, which the wire already spells `AppMenuMark::Radio` plus disabled plus a reason. The bar's own rows keep `NeedsCapability`, because they are the desktop's. **Closed in M3.4**: `system.rs`'s in-force appearance row is now `MenuMark::Radio` plus disabled, as the pinboard's sort and arrangement rows became in M3.2, and no menu row anywhere states an activity. The appearance row states no *reason*: the mark already says the appearance is in force, so the text beside it only repeated it (the pinboard's own rows still carry theirs). (`render.rs`'s remaining `ActivityState::Complete` is a *notification card* for a `Success` severity — "work finished successfully" about work that did — and is correct.) | **closed in M3.4** |
| D24 | The chain's geometry rule was stated twice: `windows::chain_geometry` for every open/settle path, and an inline copy in `shell::present_menu_chain` — which also cloned the whole active `Theme` on **every** present, so hovering a row allocated a `String`, a font set and a cursor set per repaint. M5 could not leave it: the two copies would have had to agree on the *floating* ground or a plate's pixels and its hit-test rectangles would come from two themes. **Closed**: one definition, taking the session rather than the whole shell so a caller can hold the chain (or the shell's window records) mutably while it reads it, and the clone is gone. | **closed in M5** |
| D26 | A chain that displaced another under a **different owner** inherited its compositor windows. `menu_windows` is keyed by `SurfaceKind` alone, so the new chain's root plate re-used a window created as the *previous* owner's transient: it rode the wrong family's stacking, rising with a window it does not belong to and able to end up underneath its own. Reachable without a press, because an application's `OpenMenu` arrives on the wire while another chain holds the grab. **Closed**: the shell records the owner its surfaces were opened under and takes them all down when it changes, so a displaced chain's windows are never inherited across owners. | **closed in M4** |
| D27 | `TaskbarPresenter`'s module and type rustdoc still named "its context menu" and a "menu window" among the surfaces it presents — D25's leftover in a second file, naming a surface the presenter has had no field for since `BarMenu` was deleted. **Closed**: every mention names the hover window picker, which is the surface actually there. | **closed in M4** |
| D25 | Two `Taskbar` rustdoc comments still named "the context menu" as one of the bar's five rendered surfaces — a leftover from M3.4's deletion of `BarMenu`; the fifth surface is the hover window picker, which `TaskbarRepaint` has always spelled. Stale docs mislead a reader into looking for a surface the bar no longer draws. **Closed**: both name the picker. | **closed in M5** |
| D28 | A plate band **measured** its title box in the titling face (`TextRole::WindowTitle`, Medium) and **painted** it in the heading face (`TextRole::SectionHeader`, Bold). The box is the measured line's own width, so on a variable face — whose advance widens with `wght`, as `lib/abi`'s `FontWeight` states — the bold line overflowed a box measured in the lighter weight and a plate titled *System* drew "Syst…" with the band half empty. The face was spelled three times (`seat_identity`, `render`, `TitleBar::icon_side`); one `band_text_role(commands)` is now the single reading, and `icon_side` takes the commands so it cannot drift either. Undetectable on the host until D29. | **closed** |
| D29 | `lib/font`'s `SolidTestTransport` decoded the requested weight and discarded it, reporting one advance for Medium and Bold alike — so the double contradicted the server it stands in for (`FontWeight`: the service instantiates the outline at the weight's `wght` axis and the advance moves with it), and no host test could see D28 at all. The proportional test face now widens one pixel per weight step; a fixed-pitch family stays one cell wide at every weight, as a real monospace face does. | **closed** |
| D30 | `plate_extent` sized a plate to `max(widest row, min_band_width)` and never asked its band what its *title* needed, so a title wider than every row was elided to fit rows that happened to be short — on chrome the desktop sizes to its own content and could simply have made wider. `TitleBar::preferred_band_width` answers what seats the commands and the whole identity group, floored at `min_band_width`, and the plate takes it. | **closed** |
| D31 | The quick-entry surface's pointer routing carried a `pointer` argument it never read, and its rustdoc claimed the band dragged the surface "exactly as a plate's does" — which it never did: every event went to the field, so the band was a title with a drag affordance it did not have. A press on it was harmless (the field ignores an outside press), so only the unused argument showed it. **Closed**: the argument is gone and the rule is stated — a plate is placed by the user, a child of a row is placed by the chain against its row, which is why neither this nor the information panel drags. | **closed in M6** |
| D33 | A refused row drew its reason as a caption beside its label, so `Menu::preferred_width` measured the reason and **every plate was as wide as its longest excuse**: a secondary press on a directory in `files.app` sized the whole context menu to "only a file opens with an application" — 913 physical pixels where its commands needed 145. Not a cosmetic one: the plate then covered what the user right-clicked. **Closed by removing the facility, not by shortening the text.** `MenuItem` has no reason field, no `with_reason`, no `reason()`, no caption branch for one and no width term for one, so a row *cannot* carry help text; the line moved to `ChainRow::explained`, which nothing draws, and the seat shows it as a tooltip on dwell (`plans/TOOLTIPS.md`). `AppMenuItem::reason` stays on the wire — an application cannot declare a tip region on a desktop-owned plate, so the declared reason is what the desktop puts in the tip. Every producer (the bar's system and clock menus, the backdrop, `lib/browse`'s context menu) reroutes, so no row lost its explanation. | **closed** |
| D32 | `render::selection_name_rect` landed with its own regression test and **no caller**: `files.app` still drew the in-place rename editor at `selection_rect`, the whole item rectangle, in both the paint and the key-handling bounds. The geometry was fixed and the defect it was for was not, which a host test over the primitive alone could never show. **Closed in M6**: both sites take the name rect, and `selection_rect` — whose last consumer this was — is deleted rather than left as a wrapper with no caller. | **closed in M6** |
| D34 | The grab began one drain too late. `DesktopShell::pump` applied every queued pointer event before the serve loop routed any outcome, so on a busy desktop a right-click on a slot and the click on the row it asks for were drained together: the row click was hit-tested against what lay behind a chain that did not exist yet, and the chain then opened with nothing left to choose it — the nightly soak's `appbar-qemu-aarch64` hang. The keyboard drain had the same flaw (whether a chain held the seat was read once, before the pointer outcomes that could open one), and `drain_menu_chain` handed one key to a chain the pointer had already closed. **Closed**: `pump` stops at each edge (any event but a motion or scroll sample) and says so (`Stopped::AtEdge`); the seat drain (`tairix_desktop_session::SeatDrain`, host-tested rather than living in the freestanding serve loop) drains the rest into whoever holds the seat by then in the same wake and at the same instant — so a gesture an edge split is still timed as one — re-reads the holder before every key, and drains into a chain only while it is open. Regression tests `a_row_click_queued_behind_the_press_that_opens_a_bar_menu_is_the_chains` (driving the real drain) and `pump_stops_at_each_edge_and_leaves_the_rest_queued`. | **closed in M2** |

**This is an architecture change, not a performance one.** The ~300 ms
context-menu stall that first prompted it was a kernel defect and is closed
(`plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md` H). Menus in their own windows are no longer
expensive. What this plan buys is *correctness of the model* — one menu on
the screen at a time, one implementation of menu behaviour, one place a
submenu's rules live — not milliseconds. Do not justify it on speed.

## 1. What a menu is

A menu is a **chain of session-owned plates**, not a window an app draws.

- **A plate** is one column of rows plus a **title band**: a centred text
  title and nothing else — no close, minimize, put-to-back or size-toggle
  control, no resize edge. The band is the plate's drag handle.
- **A chain** is a root plate and the descendants open beneath it. Each
  child is placed edge-adjacent to its parent at its parent row's top,
  flipped to the parent's other side when the screen edge leaves no room,
  and slid vertically to stay on screen.
- **A child is one of three things**: a **submenu** (more rows, from the same
  model), the **information panel** — the session's own `FactList` of the
  owning bundle's signed manifest — or a **quick-entry field**, the session's
  own one-line `TextField`. All three hang where a submenu hangs and all three
  obey the chain's lifetime.
- **A row that has a child may still be chooseable.** Carrying a command and
  opening a child are independent: clicking such a row answers its id, and
  arriving on it opens its child. The file manager's Rename (click to edit in
  place, arrive to type the new name) and Open With… (click for the whole
  chooser, arrive for the applications that claim the file) are the worked
  examples.
- **The chain is the seat's singleton.** One chain per seat, whoever asked
  for it. Opening a menu closes the chain that was open and answers its
  requester `Dismissed`.
- **Why a row cannot be chosen is a tip, not a caption.** A refused row states
  its reason through the seat's tooltip on dwell (`plans/TOOLTIPS.md`):
  `ChainRow::explained` holds the line, `MenuChain::hovered_tip` answers for
  the row the pointer rests on the **deepest** plate, and
  `DesktopShell::present_menu_chain` declares it over that row's screen
  rectangle once the plates are placed. The row control cannot draw help text
  at all — `MenuItem` has no reason field and measures none — because a caption
  beside every disabled label sized each plate to its longest excuse (D33).
  `AppMenuItem::reason` stays on the wire: an application cannot declare a tip
  region on a plate the desktop owns, so the declared reason is the tip's
  content.

### 1.1 The title band

Every plate carries one, and it is `lib/controls::window`'s `TitleBar` with
an **empty command set**, never a second title-bar control (§2.2). Two
properties follow from that emptiness rather than from new knobs: with no
command clusters the drag span is the whole band, and with no leading cluster
to justify against the title centres. Its ground is `Palette::title_band`, the
same role a *window's* furniture bar takes — one role, because a heading band
is this control with nothing in it. The gesture is the one already
compared and tested — press, drag threshold, `TitleBarEvent::DragBegin` /
`DragMoved` / `DragEnd` — and the title text goes through the same
untrusted-label bounding a window title does.

Titles are not new wire fields where they can be derived:

- A **submenu's** title is its parent row's label.
- The **icon-bar menu's** root title is the application's name from its
  **signed** manifest — the same attested identity its info panel states, so
  a menu cannot be titled as an application it is not.
- A **per-window menu's** root title is the app's, bounded and sanitised
  exactly as its row labels are: a name, not a credential.

### 1.2 Dragging

A press on any plate's band moves **that plate and its descendants**;
ancestors stay put. Dragging pins the plate — its placement stops being
derived from the anchor — and its children re-place relative to their parent
row as usual.

Dragging is **not** detaching. A dragged chain is still the seat's one
chain, still holds the grab, and still closes on an outside press. Nothing
an app can send pins a menu open; the only thing that moves a plate is the
user's own drag.

### 1.3 Submenus open on arrival, and there is no timer

A submenu opens when the pointer **arrives on** its parent row — no click,
no hover delay, no timer. Two placement and closing rules make that
deterministic without one:

- A child plate is **edge-adjacent** to its parent, so there is no dead gap
  for the pointer to cross and no diagonal-travel dead zone.
- An open child closes when the pointer **settles on a different row of the
  same parent plate**, or when the chain dismisses — *never* merely because
  the pointer left the parent row's rectangle. Travelling from a parent row
  into its own child therefore cannot close what it is travelling to.

A disabled submenu row opens nothing (fail closed).

### 1.4 The children that are not plates of rows

The first is the **information
panel**: a `FactList` of the owning bundle's `AppInfo`, hanging where a
submenu's plate would and dying with the chain — it closes when the pointer
settles on another row of its parent, when the chain dismisses, or when the
chain's owner dies. It wears the plate title band, so it reads as part of the
chain, and a press on it is claimed and acts on nothing: it states facts and
offers no command, so its row names no id and choosing it answers nothing.

It stays **session-drawn from the signed manifest**. The app declares only
that the row exists and supplies none of the panel's text, so it cannot state
an identity that is not its own inside desktop chrome.

The second is the **quick-entry field**: one line of session-drawn `TextField`
under the plate band, pre-filled with text the row declared. It is what lets a
menu ask for a short answer — a new name — without the application drawing
anything or seeing a keystroke. While it is up it owns the keyboard: every key
is text, its own Escape closes it before the chain's would dismiss the chain,
and `Enter` **commits**, ending the chain with the field's own id. Its band
titles it and does not drag it, because a child of a row is placed by the chain
against that row, exactly as the information panel is.

The declaring row supplies only the id and the initial text; the committed text
is the desktop's answer, held for the owning window and pulled once
(`TakeMenuText`) because an event frame is far narrower than a name. The field
cannot be masked — the model has no way to say so — so a menu row is
structurally incapable of being a password prompt.

**There is deliberately no app-drawn attached window.** M1d landed one — a
surface the *application* presented, hanging off a menu row, detaching when
its row was chosen — and it never found a client: a selection list cannot be
one (a panel cannot conclude a gesture), and M3.4 established that a
*desktop*-owned chain has no application to ask in the first place. The whole
mechanism is deleted (D19). A presentation child the desktop draws itself is
the information panel's kind, and one that takes an answer is the field's;
neither is an application's surface.

### 1.5 The grab

While a chain is up the seat's pointer and keyboard route to it:

- The grab begins **at the event that opens the chain** — the press itself
  for the desktop's own menus, the served request for an application's — not
  at the frame that draws it: every event queued behind it routes to the
  chain (D34).
- A press **inside** the chain — any plate, the information panel — acts
  there.
- A press **outside** the chain dismisses it and is **consumed**, not
  delivered. A dismissal must not double as a click on whatever was behind
  the menu.
- **Escape** closes the deepest open child; with only the root open it
  dismisses the chain. Repeated Escape therefore always gets the user out.
- **Keyboard traversal** is the service's: Up/Down within a plate, Home/End
  to its ends, Right into the highlighted row's child, Left back out of it,
  Enter/Space to activate.
- The owner window keeps its active look throughout, as an app-owned
  transient does today.
- A **mode change under the gesture** — the seat's output resized, the UI
  scale or theme switched — dismisses the chain rather than re-placing it;
  re-placing a plate the user has dragged is not defined.

### 1.6 One service, one model, in the session process

`userland/gui/session` is the desktop server: it links the compositor
(`tairix-wm`), the bar (`tairix-taskbar`), and the window server
(`tairix-window`), and owns the seat pump. The service lives there, and the
chain's plates are composited as transients of the owner through the
compositor's existing `add_transient_window` restack — inheriting the
stacking guarantees already proven there — and retained in its chrome-strip
cache.

**The desktop's own menus are clients of the service like any app's.** The
backdrop menu, the bar's application/clock/system menus, the file manager's
context menu, and the terminal's are all *models handed to the one service*;
none of them keeps a shell. The only difference is where a model comes from:
built in-process, or decoded from the wire.

That means one service-facing model type, with the wire model decoding
**into** it. The wire model is a bounded subset of what the service renders —
never a second model with a second set of behaviours (§2.2).

---

## 2. Invariants (bind every stage)

1. **One chain per seat, owned by the session (§27).** The open chain is one
   piece of seat state, not a set.
2. **The app describes; the desktop decides (§5.4).** An app sends a model
   and an anchor. The session titles, places, draws, grabs, routes,
   dismisses, and answers with *one* outcome. An app never learns pointer
   positions inside a menu, never draws a plate pixel, and cannot pin a
   chain open.
3. **One renderer, one behaviour.** The service drives `lib/controls`' `Menu`
   for rows and `TitleBar` for bands. No second menu widget, no second
   title-bar control, no per-app menu shell. Migrating a surface **deletes**
   its menu code (§2.14).
4. **The request is real ABI (§9).** Versioned, hashed, bounded, decoded
   fail-closed, fuzzed (§19.6). Evolved in place until first release
   (§2.13) — no `v2`, no shim.
5. **Bounded by construction (§24.4).** Rows per plate, label bytes, submenu
   depth and total model bytes are *format* bounds a
   hostile client cannot widen, not capacities that grow with the machine.
6. **No blocking on an app (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`).** No step of opening,
   traversing, or dismissing a chain waits on a client.
7. **Identity stays attested.** The info panel's text is the session's, from
   the signed manifest, always.
8. **The headless build is untouched (§17.3).** The service lives with the
   session; no `lib/*`, `kernel/*`, or non-GUI `userland/*` crate gains an
   edge into it.
9. **A refused menu is an answer, not a death (§2.24).** An app whose
   request is refused reports the refusal and carries on; it never
   terminates and never falls back to drawing its own.
10. **No new capability (§5.2).** Asking for a menu is scoped by the window
    the client already owns.

---

## 3. The defect this closes

1. **There is no singleton.** No component owns "the chain that is up", so
   two surfaces can each have a menu open and a menu can outlive the click
   that should have dismissed it.
2. **Menu behaviour is implemented four times over.** `lib/controls`' `Menu`
   is shared, but the *shell* around it — placement, the grab, dismissal,
   keyboard traversal, what happens when the owner moves or dies — is
   re-implemented per surface: the terminal's `menu.rs`, the file manager's
   `ContextMenu` and `OpenWithMenu`, the pinboard's backdrop menu, and the
   bar's `menu.rs`/`clock_menu.rs`/`system.rs`. Four spellings of one rule
   is the duplication §2.2 forbids —
   and none of them agrees with the others about anything in section 1.
3. **Menus have no title and cannot be moved.** Nothing draws a plate band,
   so no menu can be identified or dragged aside to read what is under it.
4. **A submenu chain does not exist.** The model allows one level, and the
   one shell that renders a child renders exactly one, so a submenu cannot
   open a submenu.
5. **An app-drawn menu is clipped by its own window.** A menu that would
   extend past its app has to become a popup window or be truncated.
6. **The compositor cannot cache what it does not own.** A plate is ideal
   cache material — small, and changing only when its highlight does — but
   while an app owns it the compositor sees only "some window presented".

---

## 4. What stands, and what of it has to change

**Built and kept:** the `AppMenu` row model in `lib/abi/src/window_ipc.rs` —
an ordered bounded list of `Item(AppMenuItem)`, `Separator`,
`Submenu { label, enabled }` and the manifest-attested `Info` row, with
non-zero item ids unique within a menu, a decoder held to the **same**
shape rule as the builder, and both fuzzed in `lib/abi/tests/fuzz_decode.rs`.
It is carried by the caller-scoped `WindowRequest::SetAppBar` and answered by
the application-scoped `WindowEvent::AppBarMenu { item }`. The service reuses
this model verbatim; a second menu model would be the duplication §2.2
forbids.

**Built and kept:** the info panel as a `FactList` of the bundle's signed
`AppInfo`, placed trailing-or-flipped at its parent row — the two-deep
special case the general chain generalises.

**Has to change (M1):**

- ~~Submenu depth, per-plate rows, a root title, accelerator text, and
  `About` → `Info`~~ — landed as M1b, along with the refusal reason (now the
  seat's tip, D33) and the role the same control draws.
- ~~The per-gesture open: an anchor, and the three-way outcome
  `Chosen(id)` / `Dismissed` / `Refused(reason)` delivered **once** to the
  requesting window~~ — landed as M1c, with the outcome keyed to a
  session-minted open id so one gesture's answer cannot read as another's.
- ~~A row kind for an app-provided attached window, plus the present request
  and the arrival/refusal events~~ — landed as M1d and **deleted in M3.4**: no
  client ever wanted it (D19), so the chain's one non-plate child is the
  session's own information panel.

**And that re-opened M0's transport decision**, settled as decision 1 and
landed as M1a. M1b then found the same cost in a second place the framing
decision did not reach — the model held *in memory*, which rides inside every
decoded `WindowRequest` — and answered it the same way (D6).

---

## 5. Stages

### M1 — the model, the wire, and the transport

The contract, in four complete steps. No renderer work here. Each step moves
the builder's shape rule and the decoder together and extends
`lib/abi/tests/fuzz_decode.rs`, so a menu that crossed the wire stays exactly
a menu that could have been built.

**M1a — variable-length request framing (landed).** A `WindowRequest` now
encodes to the length its own operation needs, not to one frame sized to the
widest. Each operation owns one named `*_WIRE_LEN` that the encoder writes to
and the decoder requires *exactly*, so a request carrying a trailing byte is
refused rather than tolerated-if-zero (D1), and the end of an operand block
has one spelling rather than two (D2). `WindowRequest::wire_len` is the
per-value length — value-dependent for `SetAppBar`, whose declaration now
carries only its declared rows. `WINDOW_MAX_REQUEST` remains the endpoint's
receive bound.

Its point is that the menu model can grow through M1b–M1d without the hot
path paying for it: `Present` was one 522-byte frame and is now 36 bytes,
which is the whole of what it needs.

**M1b — the model (landed).** `APP_MENU_MAX_ROWS` (32) now bounds one
*plate*, with `APP_MENU_MAX_TOTAL_ROWS` (64) bounding the whole menu — its
own bound rather than the product of the others, because it is what holds the
one frame a menu crosses in. Nesting is bounded by `APP_MENU_MAX_DEPTH` (4)
as a shape check over the existing parent index, so a chain is expressible at
last (D5) and a submenu on the deepest plate is refused rather than drawn
opening nothing.

A row now states everything the shared `MenuItem` control draws: its
accelerator caption (`APP_MENU_SHORTCUT_MAX`, 24), the reason it is disabled
(`APP_MENU_REASON_MAX`, 64), and its role (`AppMenuRole::{Neutral,
Destructive}`) beside the label and mark it already had. `AppMenuRow::Item`
carries an `AppMenuItem` built through `new` + `with_*` rather than seven
spelled fields, and `AppMenuRow::About` is `AppMenuRow::Info`.

Those three text fields per row would have multiplied by the row bound had a
row kept a widest-case buffer each, and `WindowRequest` carries a menu inline,
so the hot `Present` path's own frame would have grown with them (D6). A menu
therefore holds every row's text in **one** bounded block
(`APP_MENU_TEXT_BYTES`, 1536) — the "total model bytes" bound invariant 5
names — and reports rows back as `AppMenuRowView`, borrowing that block. The
wire matches: one 8-byte record per row carrying *lengths*, then the text in
row order, consumed exactly. There are no offsets, so nothing can point
anywhere, no two rows can share bytes, and no text can ride along unread.
The model is 2344 bytes where fixed-width row text would have been ~8.6 KiB,
and a pinned test keeps it that way.

A root title joins the model (`AppMenu::titled`; a submenu's plate takes its
parent row's label, §1.1). The **declaration has no title field at all**: the
icon-bar menu is titled from the bundle's signed manifest, so a titled menu
is refused at encode rather than being encoded and quietly retitled — an
application cannot title system chrome as something it is not. M1c's open
request is where a title crosses the wire.

**M1c — the open (landed).** `WindowRequest::OpenMenu { window_id, anchor,
menu }` (op 14) is the per-gesture ask: window-scoped rather than
process-scoped, and not idempotent-replace. It adds no capability — the window
the caller already owns is the scope, and ownership is the kernel-attested
identity of the in-flight caller.

The **anchor is window-local** (`WindowRegion`, physical pixels from the
requesting window's own client origin), because that is the only space an
application can speak truthfully: it is never told where its window is, and
never learns a pointer position inside a menu, so a seat-global anchor would
have to be fabricated. It is exactly what `WindowEvent::Pointer` already
reports, so an app anchors a context menu at the press it was handed. It is a
**region, not a point** — that is what §1's placement rule reads, and a
zero extent is the point case — so the bar's slot-anchored menus and an app's
context menu resolve through *one* placement rule rather than the two D4
already flags. Any origin is legitimate (the session clamps, as
`CreatePopup`'s offsets already do); only the far edge must be representable,
which is what leaves the placement arithmetic no unrepresentable input.

The **title crosses here**, carried by the menu itself (`AppMenu::titled`),
length-prefixed after the rows' text rather than in a widest-case field. A
declaration still structurally cannot carry one and is refused at encode, so
§1.1's rule stands: system chrome is titled from the signed manifest. An open
carrying no rows is refused at both ends, where a declaration legitimately
offers none. Both operations share **one** menu block codec
(`write_menu_block`/`read_menu_block`), so a row cannot be laid out one way by
a declaration and another by an open.

**The outcome is one event, and the open id is what makes it unmistakable.**
The reply is only the acceptance and carries the session-minted, never-reused
open id — the shared `WINDOW_MINTED_ID_REPLY_LEN` frame a `Create` reply now
also begins with, rather than a second near-identical shape. The answer is
exactly one `WindowEvent::MenuClosed { window_id, open_id, outcome }` with
`MenuOutcome::{Chosen, Dismissed, Refused}`. **One** kind, not three, so an
app's handling is a total `match` and the engine's "this event answers an
open" rule is one variant that cannot drift. It fits the existing fixed
40-byte event frame (14 of its 24-byte block), so an outcome costs no other
event a byte — a deliberate choice, since widening that block would have taxed
every event on the channel.

The id is load-bearing, not decoration: without it an app that asked again
while a previous answer was still in its mailbox would read one gesture's
`Dismissed` as the next one's outcome — reachable with no app bug, since a
keyboard-driven open races a delivered answer. `MenuRefusal` is closed
(`NoDisplay`, `SeatBusy`, `NoResources`) and an unknown discriminant fails
closed; a refusal is an answer the app reports and carries on from.

**Exactly-once is enforced, not hoped for.** The engine keys the open to the
attested owner, holds one unanswered open per window, and requires an outcome
to name *that window's own* open before delivering it, clearing it when the
sink accepts. A second outcome for one open is refused; so is an outcome for
another window's open, or for one already answered. Per *window* rather than
per seat is what lets M2's singleton close one chain and answer **it** while
another window's open stands — no engine change, no second slot, and no sink
threaded through the request path. A second open on a window whose open is
unanswered is refused (`AlreadyExists`), which a well-behaved app cannot reach:
while its chain is up the seat's grab consumes the press that would open
another. `WindowHost::menu_open_requested` defaults to refusing, so a desktop
composing no menu service fails closed, and a refused open records nothing and
spends no id.

**M1d — attached windows (landed, then deleted).** The row kind, its present
request, its arrival event and the engine's attach/detach lifetime were built
here and removed in M3.4 for want of any client (D19). What the stage
contributed that *stayed* is the shared frame-layout block one definition now
serves (D11), the shared surface prologue every surface-opening request writes
through (D12), and the client's per-window record pruning (D13).

### M2 — the service (landed)

`userland/gui/session/src/menu.rs` is the chain: one `Option<OpenChain>` per
seat holding the owner, the model, the plates with their placements and
pinned-by-drag flags, and whatever hangs off the deepest one. It owns model,
state and geometry and touches **no** compositor — the session presents the
surfaces it lists and takes down what it no longer has — which is what lets
every rule of section 1 be tested without a screen.

What it guarantees, beyond section 1 itself:

- **One answer, one delivery point.** Every close — a chosen row, a dismissal,
  a chain displaced by the next open, an owner's death, a mode change — queues
  its answer through `MenuChain::take_answers`, drained in one place. No path
  can answer a chain twice and none can leave one unanswered. A chain very
  often ends inside the window engine's own serve pass, which already holds
  the borrow `deliver_event` needs, so queueing *all* of them rather than only
  those is what keeps the point single.
- **The mode change is the chain's own rule**, not a dismissal every
  mode-changing call site must remember: the chain records the screen and the
  output epoch it was placed against and ends itself when either moves.
- **The service-facing model is a superset of the wire one, structurally.** A
  `ChainRow` carries the whole of `ControlState`, because the desktop's own
  rows may state that the *system* lacks authority for a command; the wire has
  no field for that, so a decoded application row cannot claim it (D10).
- **The host resolves the anchor**, because the engine retains neither the
  model nor the pointer: `ShellWindowHost::menu_open_requested` resolves the
  window-local anchor against the owner's live client origin and never reads a
  file.
- **`lib/controls::window`'s `TitleBar` seats an empty command set**
  (`TitleBarCommands::Empty`, `TitleBar::plate()`), extended rather than
  copied: one drag gesture, one untrusted-label bounding. The whole-band drag
  span and the centred title follow from the emptiness, not from new knobs.

**`MenuRefusal` has its producers, one per seat condition.** `NoDisplay` when
there is no output to place on and `SeatBusy` when a surface a menu may not
displace holds the seat (the lock screen, the trusted picker) are decided as
the open is served — the open is *accepted*, so the application is owed its one
answer and gets the reason rather than a chain. `NoResources` is answered where
it is honest: when the session actually cannot give a plate its surface, which
is at draw time, not at ask time. A refusal never takes down a chain the user
is already using.

Two things the stage's own test list named that the tree answers differently,
rather than leaving untested:

- **Seat loss** has no per-chain answer. Losing the lease ends the *session*
  (`drain_fault`), and the window channel goes with it, so there is no
  surviving path on which a `MenuClosed` could be delivered. The chain's
  lifetime rules cover owner death and the mode change; seat loss is the
  session's own end.
- **Damage confinement** is M4's, not this stage's. What M2 guarantees, and
  tests, is that a pointer travelling *within* a row costs no repaint at all,
  and that moving a highlight on one plate opens, closes and moves nothing
  else; what a repaint of the plate itself *costs* is M4's, and landed there.

The desktop's own surfaces are **not** clients yet: the pinboard's backdrop
menu is M3.2 and the bar's four subjects are M3.4, which is where those
migrations already lived. The service's production client today is the wire
path — any application's `OpenMenu`, implemented end to end.

### M3 — migrate, and delete

Each landing complete with its tests and docs, and each **deleting** the
surface's menu shell (§2.14):

1. `userland/apps/terminal` — `menu.rs` (`ContextMenu`, and `Command`'s
   shortcut table where the model now carries it) and the popup-window
   plumbing its run loop drives it through.
2. ~~`userland/gui/session`'s pinboard backdrop menu~~ — landed as M3.2.
3. ~~`userland/apps/files` — its `ContextMenu` and `OpenWithMenu`~~ — landed
   as M3.3.
4. ~~`userland/gui/taskbar` — `menu.rs`, `clock_menu.rs`, `system.rs`~~ —
   landed as M3.4. The bar kept its *subjects* and lost its shell.
5. ~~`userland/gui/taskbar`'s start menu~~ — decision 3 settled it: the
   program-library popup is a searchable scrolled list, not a menu, and stays
   bespoke. Nothing to migrate.

**M3.1 (landed).** `userland/apps/terminal` keeps no menu shell: `ContextMenu`,
its `MenuOutcome`, and the popup arm that drew them are gone, and `menu.rs` is
now the row model alone — `Command::ALL` built into an `AppMenu` by
`menu::model`, read back by `Command::from_item`. A secondary press sends
`OpenMenu` with the window-local point the press was reported at; the answer is
one `MenuClosed` matched against the open id that window is waiting on, so an
answer to a settled gesture cannot run a stale command. The accelerator
captions are the model's rows, and a test parses each row's own caption back
through `Command::accelerator`, so a row cannot advertise a keystroke that does
nothing. `Command::accelerator` itself stays: matching a keystroke is not the
same thing as captioning a row. The settings sheet is **not** a menu and keeps
its popup surface; `Content`/`OverlayRequest` collapsed to it alone.

**M3.2 (landed).** The pinboard keeps no menu shell: `PinboardMenu`, its
`PinboardMenuOutcome`, the seat drain and settle path that drove it, and
`DesktopShell`'s `present_pinboard_menu` / `pinboard_menu_bounds` / its own
compositor window are all gone. `pinboard.rs` is now the row model alone —
`PinboardCommand::ALL` built into a `ChainModel` by `pinboard::model`, read back
by `PinboardCommand::from_item` — and `DesktopAction::OpenMenu` is deleted with
it: `Desktop::context_press` answers whether an icon was under the press and
names no action, because the menu is the seat's chain and the embedder that owns
the chain opens it.

It opens with `ChainOwner::Backdrop`, so no `OpenMenu` crosses a wire, no open id
is minted, and its one answer arrives at `run.rs`'s single delivery point
(`answer_menu_chain`) beside every application's. **The two seat drains became
one**: the chain's drain now carries the desktop state a chosen backdrop row
acts on, so the pinboard's duplicate is gone.

Two rules landed with it rather than being carried over. D10's judgement is
applied: the sort order and the arrangement in force are a *radio group* —
`MenuMark::Radio` plus disabled plus a reason — not `ActivityState::Complete`,
which said "work finished successfully" about an appearance row. And a row's id
is its command's own position in `PinboardCommand::ALL` rather than its position
on the plate, so the gesture that leaves `Open` out shifts no other row's
meaning. M3.4 converted the bar's `system.rs` in-force appearance row the same
way.

The desktop's own menu also now resolves through the **same** seat rule an
application's open does (`seat_menu_refusal`, hoisted out of
`ShellWindowHost::seat_refusal`), so a backdrop press cannot take the grab from
the lock screen or the trusted picker by arriving from the other direction — a
guarantee M2 stated as the service's and the old shell did not have.

**M3.3 (landed).** `userland/apps/files` keeps no menu shell: `ContextMenu`,
`OpenWithMenu`, the two routers that owned input while each was up
(`apply_menu_event` / the old `apply_open_with_event`), and `lib/browse`'s seven
drawn-menu renderers (`build_context_menu`, `context_menu_rect`,
`draw_context_menu`, `context_menu_command_at`, `context_menu_command_rect`,
`build_open_with_menu`, `open_with_index_at`, and the private
`menu_enabled_row_at` they shared) are all gone. It is a **wire** client, so
M3.1 is its template: `lib/browse::chrome` is now the row model alone —
`CONTEXT_COMMANDS` built into an `AppMenu` by `context_menu`, read back by
`context_command_from_item`, with the one-based `row_id`/`from_item` inverses so
ids need no second table — and `run.rs`'s `open_context_menu` sends `OpenMenu`
with the window-local point the press was reported at, storing the returned open
id on the window (`OpenWindow::menu`). The answer is one `MenuClosed` matched
against that id, so an answer to a settled gesture cannot run a stale command; a
refusal is stated on `stderr` and the window carries on.

Two rules landed with it rather than being carried over. A row's id is its
command's own position in `CONTEXT_COMMANDS` (M3.2's rule), and because every
command is declared *disabled with its reason* rather than left out, position on
the plate and position in the list are the same thing however few are
actionable. And `ContextMenuModel::is_enabled` is now **derived from** a new
`reason`, so a row cannot be greyed with nothing to say — the reason field M1b
landed has its first client, and the three ways Open With… can be inapplicable
(no selection, not a file, a link that leads nowhere) each say which.

`ContextMenuModel` itself **stays**, as the plan said: it is the model that keeps
the file manager and the trusted picker from diverging. What moved is only where
the rows are *drawn*.

The builder lives in `lib/browse` rather than in the app because `run.rs` is a
freestanding binary no host test can reach: the model, the id round-trip, the
reasons, the emphasis, and the chooser's whole geometry are host-proven there,
and what is left in the app is the glue the menu vertical already exercises for
the terminal.

Decision 2 is settled above, so **Open With… is one row that concludes the
chain** and the chooser is the application's own surface: `OpenWithChooser` in
`lib/browse::open_with` (candidates, the shared row cursor, and the
`ScrollColumn` it scrolls through — its offset and its own `ScrollBar`) drawn by
`render::draw_open_with_chooser` as a scrolled list of `ListRow`s in a `Panel`,
hit-tested by `open_with_row_at` through the one placement all three share. It
scrolls by pixels — by wheel, by the drawn bar's drag, and by Up/Down/Home/End
with the selection revealed. A press on a row picks it; a double-click, `Enter`
or the Open button hands the file over through the same `launch_viewer` the
default open uses; `Escape` or Cancel dismisses it; and a press on the panel's
own plate picks nothing. Its bar, the listing's and the Properties window's
columns route a press through **one** rule (`ScrollColumn::route`), so they
cannot come to behave differently.

D20 is the migration's own finding: the chain's grab took the right-double-click
gesture's second press away, so that capability is a menu row now
(`ContextCommand::OpenAndClose`) and `gesture.rs` loses the three types that
spelled the gesture. Nothing else in the tree drew or clicked the file manager's
context menu — no QEMU vertical reconstructed it — so the migration broke no
end-to-end test; `PLAN.md`'s claim that the FM9-c right-click→Delete
click-through was wired into the `autoload_input` vertical was already stale and
is corrected there.

**M3.4 (landed).** The icon bar keeps no menu shell: `BarMenu`, `MenuLayout`,
`MenuChoice`, `MenuOutcome`, `OpenChild`, `TaskbarRepaint::MENU`,
`TaskbarRenderer::render_menu`, `TaskbarPresenter::present_menu`,
`Taskbar::{menu, menu_routing_mut, menu_layout, open_*_menu, close_menu}` and
the router's `route_to_menu`/`apply_choice`/`apply_system_action` are all gone.
The bar holds **no menu state at all** — while a chain is up the seat's grab
means no event reaches the bar, so there is nothing for it to be modal about.

It is an **in-process** client, so M3.2 is its template rather than M3.1: a
secondary press answers `TaskbarResponse::OpenMenu(MenuRequest)` — which menu,
its rows, and where the plate hangs — and `run.rs`'s `open_bar_menu` opens the
seat's one chain for it. All four subjects migrated: the application slot's
declared menu, the program-library row's context menu, the system quick
actions, and the clock.

**The model type moved to `lib/controls`.** An in-process client builds a
`ChainModel` (never an `AppMenu` — D10's authority state has no wire field), and
the bar cannot depend on the session, which depends on *it*. So `ChainModel`,
`ChainRow`, `ChainChild`, `from_app_menu` and `INFO_ROW_LABEL` now live beside
the `Menu`/`MenuItem`/`FactList` they are made of, and `lib/controls` gains the
`lib/abi` edge the row id and the wire model need (every crate that already
depends on `lib/controls` depends on `lib/abi` too, so nothing widens). The
chain itself — state, geometry, grab, lifetime, answers — stays in the session.
`PlatePlacement { anchor, side, gap }` joined it: three values every caller
passes together, which turns `plate_rect` from six arguments into four and lets
the desktop's shared open path stay inside the argument threshold.

**One chain, two answer shapes, and the seam is the owner.** `ChainOwner` is
now `Window { window_id, open_id } | Backdrop | Bar(MenuSubject)` — the address
an answer goes to. A chosen row of a **wire** chain leaves as the `MenuClosed`
the engine holds it to; a chosen row of a **bar** chain is read back by the bar
itself (`Taskbar::menu_chosen`, over the same table the plate was built from)
into the very `TaskbarResponse` a click on the bar produces, and routed where
those are. So the application-scoped `AppBarMenu` relay is untouched: the App
subject answers `AppMenuChosen { app, item }` and `route_outcome` relays the id
to the declaring process exactly as before. The subject travels **inside** the
owner rather than beside it, so a chain the next open displaces cannot have its
answer read against the next chain's subject.

The desktop's two in-process menus now open through **one** call
(`menu::open_desktop_menu`), which applies the seat rule (§1.5) and the model
check together, so neither the backdrop nor the bar can take the grab from the
lock screen or the trusted picker. And **the two seat drains became one**: the
chain drain lives inside the `SEAT_TOKEN` branch and its answers flow through
the branch's existing routing loop, so a *Log Out* row and a *Log Out* click
are honoured in one place — the alternative was a third copy of that routing.

Three rules landed with it rather than being carried over. A row's id is its
command's own position in its table (M3.2's rule), so the system menu without
*Switch User…* shifts no other row's meaning — and that numbering is now one
definition rather than three (D22). D10's remainder is applied: the in-force
appearance row is a radio group, not `ActivityState::Complete`, and explains
nothing — the mark already says the appearance is in force. And D19 is
closed by deletion: a desktop-owned chain has no application to draw an
attached window, so the mechanism had no client and is gone.

`userland/gui/switchboard` is a **wire** client, with M3.1 as its template: a
Tasks row's menu (`task_menu.rs`) opens on a secondary press or on Enter, the
panel holds the one open it is owed an answer for, and a chosen row acts on
the task by identity against the model held when the answer lands.
`userland/apps/widgets` draws a `Menu` as a *control-gallery sample*, not as
a menu; it stays.

Every menu-shell helper in `lib/controls` has two or more consumers (§15.5):
`plate_rect` and `PlatePlacement` place every plate and the information panel,
`Menu::render_rows` paints the rows of every plate, `TitleBar::plate` bands
them, and `ChainModel` is built by the bar, by the pinboard and by the wire
decode.

### M4 — a plate is a retained, damage-reporting surface (landed)

Only meaningful after M3, because while an application owned menu pixels the
desktop had nothing to retain. A plate is now cached chrome like the window
furniture (`plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md`): its compositor window keeps its pixels
between presents, and moving a highlight repaints and marks the two rows the
mark moved between rather than the plate.

Before it, every `Redraw` allocated a fresh surface for **every** plate and the
information panel, painted each whole, and handed them all to `set_surface` —
so one pointer sample crossing a row boundary cost a plate-sized allocation per
surface, a full paint of each, and a whole-rectangle mark on all of them. On
frosted, translucent chrome that mark is the expensive part: the plate has to
be re-blended against what it stands over, everywhere it covers.

- **The chain says what it owes, per surface.** Each plate and the information
  panel carries a `Repaint` — `Whole`, or the rectangles it owes in its own
  local pixels — and `ChainSurface` reports it. `Whole` is the state a surface
  is *born* in, which is what makes a plate rebuilt at a depth another plate
  held (a different submenu, possibly the same size, re-using that depth's
  window) repaint completely rather than showing the previous menu's rows.
  Row damage comes from the shared controls themselves: `Menu`'s highlight
  already reports the row the mark left and the row it arrived on, and the
  chain folds those screen rectangles into the plate's own space. `presented`
  clears what a surface owed, called per surface the session actually painted,
  so a heap refusal keeps its debt rather than reporting stale pixels current.
- **The compositor grew the window mirror of `repaint_desktop`.**
  `Compositor::repaint_window(id, size, area, paint)` hands back the window's
  retained content buffer with the rectangles of `area` clipped to it and marks
  only those; a window whose content is absent or is not `size` is given a
  fresh buffer, painted whole, and its geometry follows. The embedder *declares*
  its damage where a client's `present_window_content` has it *discovered* by
  the conversion, and that is the honest split: an embedder painting its own
  model knows what changed before it paints.
- **One paint, run under a clip.** The session clips the surface to each
  rectangle and calls `MenuChain::render_surface`, so there is no second
  "paint just this row" recipe to disagree with the first — only the writes are
  withheld. `render_surface` is also now the *only* entry point for a chain's
  pixels: the shell's own information-panel recipe is gone, and plate and panel
  share one `lay_plate` ground.
- **The paint starts from nothing, and has to.** Laying the plate ground
  *replaces* a pixel the shape fully covers but mixes an **arc** pixel toward it
  by that pixel's coverage, so a rounded corner would keep a tint of the
  highlight that last passed over it. `lay_plate` therefore clears before it
  lays, which is what a whole paint into a fresh buffer does anyway — and what
  makes "a partial repaint lands the pixels a whole one would" true by
  construction rather than by inspection. A test drives two chains identically,
  one repainted whole at every step and one only where it said it had changed,
  and compares the surfaces pixel for pixel.
- **What it costs now.** A highlight move: two rows re-derived, two rectangles
  marked, and no other surface of the chain touched. A drag: a move, and no
  repaint at all — the same pixels are simply somewhere else. A pointer
  travelling within one row: nothing, as M2 already guaranteed.

### M5 — a plate is floating chrome, not a solid card

**Landed.** Every menu reads like the taskbar and the popups it opens: a plate
is drawn on the *floating* theme, so its `surface_raised` ground takes the
palette's `chrome_alpha` and the compositor frosts what is behind it by
`chrome_backdrop_blur`. This superseded M2's "a plate covers what it opens
over", and the two tests stating that inverted with the stage.

Opacity and blur are **one decision, not two**: blur behind an opaque surface is
per-frame work nothing shows through, and translucency without blur is sharp
detail competing with the rows on top. A plate therefore takes both from the
shared theme values, never a weight of its own.

The values decision 4 fixed: `CHROME_ALPHA` is **204** (four fifths), and
`chrome_backdrop_blur` stays **7** logical pixels. Because the alpha is shared,
this re-skinned every floating surface — the bar, its popups, the notification
popover, the Switchboard readout, and every control plate standing on them.
`CHROME_PLATE_ALPHA` is now *derived* from it (half of what is left between the
ground and solid, which reproduced the authored 217 exactly at the old 179), so
raising the chrome opacity cannot narrow the step a raised plate reads by — at a
hand-authored 217 that step would have collapsed from 38 to 13.

What the chain does with it:

- The chain's geometry is the **one** `chain_geometry(session, compositor)`
  definition, and it carries the floating theme. The shell's own inline copy is
  gone (D24), so the pixels a plate is painted with and the row rectangles it is
  hit-tested against cannot come from two themes. Grounding a theme floating
  flips nothing but the ground, so no rectangle moved.
- The floating form is derived **once** for the desktop
  (`DesktopSession::floating_theme`), and the taskbar takes it rather than
  flipping its own: the ground is a property of where a surface is put on
  screen, and the session is what puts the bar, its popups and every plate
  there. One derivation is what makes a theme switch unable to leave a surface
  behind (`reground` is the single path both take).
- Every surface of the chain — each plate and the information panel — is
  rounded and frosted on **one** path in `present_menu_chain`, whichever of the
  three ways its compositor window was obtained (re-surfaced, created as the
  owner's transient, created standalone). Before, only the standalone path
  stated a look.
- A plate's own **rows** take `chrome_alpha` through the shared `ChromeLayer`
  rule, so a resting row stays exactly its ground with no second rule.

Untouched by it: the plate is still one ground for the band and the rows
together (D15), and the corner radius and rim are still the shared popup
recipe's.

The QEMU vertical's plate dump could no longer compare against an exact
`surface_raised`, so it now predicts each pixel as the ground composited over
what the pre-menu frame showed at that point, at the palette's alpha — which
holds a translucent plate to the exact composite the theme asks for, over the
terminal and over the wallpaper alike, where a bare distance from the ground
colour would have admitted any dark repaint.

### M6 — a row may act *and* open a child (landed)

Three capabilities, one shape: a row's command and a row's child stop being
alternatives.

- **A submenu is a relationship, not a row kind.** `AppMenu::push_under`
  accepts an `Item` parent, so a chooseable row with children draws the chevron
  and opens a plate on arrival while still answering its id when clicked.
  `AppMenuRow::Submenu` stays for a parent with no command of its own. The
  shared control stopped guessing: `Menu::activate` reports `Activated` for
  every clicked actionable row and the *chain* decides whether that is an
  answer or a child, because only the model knows which rows carry a command
  (the keyboard's `Right` is the gesture that means only "walk in", and keeps
  its own arm).
- **A quick-entry field** (§1.4) is the second non-plate child:
  `AppMenuItem::with_entry`, `ChainChild::Entry`, `SurfaceKind::Entry`, and
  `MenuOutcome::Entered` naming the field's own id. The text is held per window
  by the window engine — which already mints and owns the open id and already
  checks that a caller owns the window it names — and pulled once with
  `TakeMenuText`: owner-bound, one-shot, cleared by that window's next open, so
  a commit nobody pulled can never answer a later gesture. The session records
  it *before* the answer goes out, and a refusal to record degrades the gesture
  to a dismissal rather than naming a text nobody holds.
- **A row may name the bundle its icon comes from** (`with_icon_bundle`), and
  the session resolves it through the one `ArtworkCache` with the identical
  `IconRequest::bundle` a taskbar slot uses — so the artwork tier reads the
  bundle's own *signed* manifest and nothing else, an unresolvable path costs
  only the picture, and the paint itself reads nothing (`resolve_chain_icons`
  runs before it, mirroring `resolve_library_icons`).

The bounds are the format's, not capacities: `APP_MENU_ENTRY_MAX` is
`FS_NAME_MAX` because the field's purpose is a name, and `APP_MENU_BUNDLE_MAX`
is what a row record's one-byte length can state. The whole model still has to
fit `APP_MENU_TEXT_BYTES`, so a builder asks what is left before adding a row
rather than pushing and swallowing a refusal.

## 6. Decisions required (§15.7)

1. **The transport, re-opened by section 4.** `WindowRequest` is one fixed
   frame sized to its widest operation, so a richer menu model widens the
   frame `Present` pays for on every composited frame.
   **Recommendation: make the request frame variable-length** — a
   length-prefixed payload with a per-op maximum, written into a caller
   buffer rather than materialised as one fixed array. The menu model then
   grows without touching the hot path, and `Present` *shrinks* to the bytes
   it actually uses (§2.16). Alternatives: keep the fixed frame and accept
   the widening; or grant a shared region per declaration (rejected at M0
   for a per-open cost, but a *declaration* is rare enough that it would now
   be defensible).
2. **A dynamic list longer than a plate — settled, reversed by the owner and
   superseded by M6.** Open With… is **a row that both acts and opens a
   submenu**: arriving on it opens a plate of the applications that claim the
   file, highest-ranked first and each drawing its own icon; clicking the row
   itself opens the complete scrolling chooser. A plate still cannot promise to
   hold a list that grows with what a user installs, so the submenu is the
   *top* of the ranked list (`OPEN_WITH_QUICK_MAX`) and the chooser remains the
   whole of it. Two of the three original objections are answered rather than
   waived, and the third no longer applies:
   - **The per-plate row bound is not raised.** A plate does not scroll, so the
     quick list is bounded well inside it and the row's own click is the way to
     everything else. Widening a format bound "to be flexible" is still what
     §24.4 forbids.
   - **A submenu cannot be lazy, so the candidates are warm before the
     gesture.** The model crosses the wire complete, so the rows must exist
     when `OpenMenu` is sent. The file manager therefore keeps its program-store
     scan warm on the worker it already has (`Reads::want_bundles`): a
     right-click reads the answer that has **already landed** and performs no
     I/O at all, and asks again so the next gesture is current. Before the
     first scan lands the row simply carries no chevron and its click opens the
     chooser — the honest degradation, not a stall (§28). The staleness the
     original objection feared is bounded by one gesture, not by the life of a
     long-running component.
   - **An attached window still cannot conclude the gesture**, and nothing here
     is one: a submenu's rows are rows of the chain, so choosing one ends the
     chain with its id exactly as any other row does (D19 stands).
   What this buys is that the common case — "open this in that" — is one
   gesture inside the menu, with the application's own icon to aim at. What it
   costs is that the file manager must keep a scan warm to offer it, which is
   stated above and is where the cost belongs: in the application that knows
   what it browses, never on the desktop's open path.
3. **The bar's start menu — settled. It is not a menu and stays bespoke**, so
   M3 step 5 is closed with nothing to migrate. The program-library popup
   (`userland/gui/taskbar/src/library.rs`) is a **searchable, scrolled list over
   a data set the machine's size decides**: it holds a text filter, a scroll
   offset with the shared `ScrollBar`, and expandable folders over a catalog as
   large as the programs a user installs. One reason binds, and it is enough:
   - **A plate does not scroll.** `plate_rect` bounds a plate to the viewport
     and nothing scrolls it, so the entry set — which grows with what is
     installed — has no bound a plate could promise to hold. Raising the
     per-plate row bound moves the refusal rather than removing it, and widens a
     format bound "to be flexible" (§24.4).
   Three reasons that might have been expected to bind do **not**, and saying so
   is what makes this a decision rather than a restatement. A plate now *does*
   take text (M6's quick-entry field), so the popup's filter is no longer a
   reason — but a field is one line the desktop commits, not a live filter over
   rows fixed at open, so it does not give the launcher what it needs either.
   The popup is session-owned, so nothing about it crosses the wire complete.
   And its rows carry icons, which `MenuItem` draws. None of the three rescues
   it from the scroll. Expandable folders are *disclosure within one surface*,
   not a chain of child plates, so they are not a submenu either.
   What this costs is that the launcher does not read as a menu, which is the
   honest shape: a list of *everything installed* is a browser, and browsers
   scroll and filter. What it buys is that the popup keeps the search and the
   scroll it needs, while the genuine menu inside it — the context menu on one
   of its rows (`MenuSubject::Entry`) — is the desktop's chain like every other,
   migrated in M3.4.

4. **What "80% opacity and 50% blur" means in the theme — settled by the
   owner** (bound M5, landed with it). The requirement named two figures and two
   reference surfaces that disagreed: the program-library popup and the
   Switchboard capsule's menu were drawn at `CHROME_ALPHA` = 179 (70%) over
   `chrome_backdrop_blur` = 7 logical pixels. The owner's answer splits the two:
   - **The opacity is literal, and it is the shared value that moves.** 80%,
     i.e. `CHROME_ALPHA` = **204** — and the 70% every *other* floating surface
     was drawn at moves with it, rather than menus taking a second alpha of
     their own. So this is a deliberate re-skin of all floating chrome: the bar,
     the library popup, the notification popover, the Switchboard readout and
     every control plate standing on them, including the two surfaces the
     requirement cited as already right.
   - **The blur matches the right-hand icon-bar surface**, which is the shared
     `chrome_backdrop_blur` = **7** logical pixels. It does not move. The "50%"
     reading — half the `WINDOW_BACKDROP_BLUR_MAX_PX` (64) wire ceiling, i.e.
     32 — is **not** taken: that would have been a four-and-a-half-fold radius
     increase on every frosted surface, and the surface the owner points at is
     the one already at 7.
   - **A second alpha or blur for menus alone was rejected**, and stays
     rejected: two more theme values would say what `chrome_alpha` and
     `chrome_backdrop_blur` already say, and the requirement asks for menus to
     *match* those surfaces rather than differ from them.
   One consequence the requirement did not name and M5 therefore had to settle:
   `CHROME_PLATE_ALPHA` was hand-authored at 217, a step of 38 above the old
   ground. Left alone at an 80% ground it would have become a step of 13, so a
   button would have stopped reading as furniture standing on the glass. It is
   now *derived* — half of what is left between the ground and solid — which
   reproduces 217 exactly at the old 179, so this names the authored rule rather
   than changing it, and no future change to the chrome opacity can narrow the
   step to nothing.

## 7. Definition of done (whole plan)

- One chain can be open per seat, no app draws a menu pixel, and every menu
  in the desktop — the apps' and the desktop's own — comes from the one
  service.
- Every plate has a title band and drags by it; submenus open on arrival
  with no timer; the information panel hangs where a submenu would and dies
  with the chain.
- The info panel's text is the session's, from the signed manifest.
- Every migrated surface's menu code is **deleted**, not left beside the new
  path (§2.14), and no second menu shell or title-bar control exists
  anywhere (§2.2).
- The request is bounded, validated, fail-closed and fuzzed (§5.4, §19.6),
  and adds no capability (§5.2).
- The headless build still builds and runs with every `userland/gui/*` crate
  excluded (§17.3), and `cargo xtask deps-check` stays green.
- Docs land with the code: `docs/src/desktop/menus.md` states the model of
  section 1, and every migrated surface's page loses its menu description
  (§13).
- Whole-project gate green (§7): `cargo fmt --all`, one `cargo xtask ci`,
  `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5`, `tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20`.
