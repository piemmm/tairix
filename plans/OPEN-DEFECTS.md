# OPEN-DEFECTS — Close the remaining open core-kernel defect classes

Status: **in progress**

Binding under `AGENTS.md`. This plan is the single tracker for driving
the remaining open core-kernel defect classes to closure. It assumes
`plans/FIX-SYSCALL.md` is **substantially done** — syscalls run with
interrupts enabled on the bare-metal ports, the deferred drain runs on
the syscall return path, and the console-RX lock discipline (C1) is
closed — with only the residual per-arch validation verticals still
outstanding (D1 below). It supersedes no other plan; each defect keeps
its own detailed plan where one exists and this file is the umbrella.

Read first (§15.18): `plans/FIX-SYSCALL.md`, `plans/WATCHDOG.md`,
`plans/WIRING.md` (Arch HAL parity), `plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md`
(x86_64 product parity), `plans/CODEVERIFY.md` (the §27 sweep spirit),
`PLAN.md`'s P-series ("Preemption and blocking", P-6).

## Ledger

Index only. Each defect's own section — or, for the entries that have no
section, its Scope bullet below, and for those with neither, its row here —
is authoritative if they ever disagree. The record spells closure as DONE,
FIXED, and CLOSED interchangeably; this table normalises all three to
**closed**, and a partial fix stays **open**. 197 open, 287 closed, 484 total.

### Open (197)

| ID | Subject | Note |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | FIX-SYSCALL residual per-arch verticals (x86_64, riscv64) | design and code done; verticals not written |
| D3 | hard-lockup watchdog parity on x86_64 and riscv64 | aarch64 is the only port wired |
| D15 | `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` freeze at the PTY Ctrl-C stage | — |
| D17 | riscv64 loader performs no instruction-cache maintenance for loaded code | does not reproduce under QEMU; real silicon can fetch stale code |
| D21 | a layered block device republishes an unreadable member class as `Virtual` | — |
| D27 | ARXFS has no persistent deduplication index | correctness-safe |
| D32 | CPU 0 never returns to the dispatch loop, so every deferred wake strands | — |
| D46 | no discard reaches the hardware through a layer | partial — partition half closed; RAID and transport halves open |
| D49 | on aarch64 and riscv64 a vertical's success status is also what a reset produces | — |
| D53 | kernel-heap grow/shrink thrash costs work proportional to page count | reachability unconfirmed; fix only once confirmed |
| D60 | the window-content release has no end-to-end vertical | — |
| D80.1 | a window the terminal is refused is invisible to the user: the refusal reaches only its `stderr`, which a desktop app has no reader for | sub-item of the closed D80. The charter's fallback, the system log, needs `CAP_LOG_EMIT` in the terminal's manifest; a notice in the app's own UI is a `plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md` decision |
| D85 | an uninstalled x86_64 vector parks with no record; a spurious LAPIC interrupt is fatal | — |
| D97 | a userland service's log threshold cannot be lowered on a shipped system | four documents told the reader to lower it; corrected. The device manager's `13002`/`13006`/`13007` are unreachable on a real boot |
| D98 | the harness cannot order a typed key after a pointer click | blocks FM9-a's rename + toolbar gestures and FM9-c's delete click-through; needs one ordered script and a typed-key vocabulary |
| D99 | `lib/browse`'s `render::manager_tool_rect` has no caller outside its own tests | speculative surface kept deliberately; resolves with D98 or is deleted with the gesture |
| D103 | the fork-join pool has no true-SMP vertical | coverage gap, not a known defect; needs secondary bring-up in a user-program chassis |
| D111 | `rng_soak`'s `approximate-entropy` reference distribution runs 0.8 high | the only statistic whose null is genuinely wrong; a higher-order overlapping-window bias. Four others have no derived null but measure correct |
| D113 | `netstack-bond-qemu-aarch64` guest exits before its readiness marker | `qemu status -1` mid-scenario with no guest fault in the serial; cause unconfirmed |
| D118 | host tests that share one low task/process identity against process-global kernel state, and registries whose tests take no guard | partial — the registry guards and every reachable identity collision are closed, the latter as D147. Open: `console::cooked_foreground_maps_ctrl_c_to_a_queued_interrupt` failed once in 500 shuffled runs and is unexplained, its install-once-hook lead untested; and an isolated identity is still not the default — 300 of `syscalls.rs`'s 450 tests spell the literal `2` |
| D122 | kthread admission aborts the kernel on an allocation failure instead of failing closed | partial — the stack, the allocation that actually fails, is now a `Result`; the control block and the `Box<dyn>` around it still abort through the global allocator's handler |
| D123 | `kernel/core` is not under the UB oracle | `kernel/mem` is **closed** — enrolled and green (0 leaks) once `DirectPhysMap` gained a provenance root, every leaked fixture became a `Once` cell, `slab`'s proptest stopped wanting a cwd, the sample-sized sweeps were scaled, and the crate was dealt across the host's cores (`Spread::PerCore`) instead of taken serially in one process, which is what overran the runner's per-job budget; one 4-hour `dma` test is skipped by name. Stage 383 s. `kernel/core` is **not** budget-bound as previously recorded: 577 test-side `Box::leak` sites across ~40 fixture types had never been seen, because every whole-crate run aborted on provenance before the leak check ran — see the section |
| D127 | the tree carries `static mut`, which the charter names as a hack, in ~30 source files and 139 test kernels | noticed while enrolling `lib/kalloc`; not absorbed. Every site is a `.bss` arena or table (`HEAP`, `KERNEL_STACKS`, port scratch) reached only through `addr_of!`, so none creates a reference and none trips `static_mut_refs` — a spelling, not a known soundness bug. `SyncUnsafeCell` is the modern form. `tairix_kalloc::Heap` no longer forces it: the arena is a plain `static` reached through `Heap::as_mut_ptr`, and the Settings vertical is the first binary built that way, so the heap sites convert one line each. Either the sweep lands or a charter carve-out says why storage is not state; today neither is written down |
| D131 | the interleaving oracle reaches only `lib/sync`, and `kernel/sched/mlfq`'s existing loom models are dead | `--cfg loom` does not compile the kernel crate graph at all: loom's atomics have no `const` constructor, so every `const fn`-built static below is rejected in a static initialiser — `kernel/arch/api`'s `static ACTIVE_FRAMES: Once<_> = Once::new()` is the first, and `WaitQueue::new` / `SleepLock::new` are the same shape. So `kernel/sched/mlfq/tests/loom.rs` has models that **cannot be built and are enrolled nowhere** (its doc claimed `cargo xtask test` ran them; corrected), and `kernel/core` cannot be enrolled, which is why D129's interleavings are driven deterministically instead of searched. Resolving it means removing that `const` construction across the graph, or a loom shim in each crate that owns such a static; `kernel/sched/api::park` would need one too. Distinct from D123, which is the UB oracle |
| D132 | no run states whether a *double-click* in a file-manager window reaches `activate` on a guest | coverage gap with an unexplained observation behind it, not a confirmed defect. The `handover_qemu_aarch64` vertical originally injected the pair as one four-edge burst and never passed. The burst **was** delivered: four window events reached the manager's own event mailbox (`0xE117…` tagged with the `files` task) in the 60 ms after that window's first frame, and the manager repainted twice after them — yet no `fd_grant` followed. The aim was verified independently against the run's screendump and round-trips to the intended entry through the production hit-test, and the shared pairing rule accepts two presses 32 ms apart on one subject (neither `Moved` nor `Released` resets the tracker). So either the burst yielded one press rather than two, or the two resolved to different subjects — and **no existing record can tell them apart**: `MessageDelivered` carries a port, a sender and a length, every window event is 40 bytes, and no audit event anywhere names a pointer action. Answering it needs a witness that names the delivered event kind, plus re-adding injection (`PointerAction::DoubleClick` was deleted with its last consumer). The vertical now activates through the item's context-menu *Open* row, which runs the same `activate`, so the delegation chain is covered and only the pairing path is host-tested only |
| D139 | `lib/rt` is not under the UB oracle, and cannot be enrolled as the registry's scopes stand | noticed while adding a granted-region mapping; the allocator's pager seam hands it fabricated addresses, which strict provenance refuses as *unsupported* — a reason `Scope::LibExcept` does not currently admit |
| D140 | the desktop never installs the notification-icon set it can load, so a shipped chrome SVG would be ignored | latent today (no chrome kind ships an SVG); wiring it naively costs 80 speculative per-kind lookups at bring-up, so the fix is to discover the present assets from one directory listing first — see below |
| D141 | a per-inode ACL can be authored at provisioning but never changed or read back: there is no `fs_set_acl` and no `getfacl`/`setfacl` | noticed while designing `plans/SSH.md` §1.4; not absorbed. The rest of the §5.3 model is complete — `kernel/core/src/fs/perm.rs` enforces capability gate → ACL → mode, ARXFS persists the ACL, `tairix_users::policy` authors one at home provisioning — so the gap is only the userland write and read-back path: `fs_set_mode`/`fs_set_owner` exist and their ACL counterpart does not. Three consequences: a grant lives and dies with the inode its provisioner created, so a file a user deletes and recreates silently loses it; an account provisioned before a grant is introduced has no repair path short of recreating the home; and a user cannot inspect the non-mode authority over their own files, which for a security mechanism is the sharper one. Closing it is a syscall + ABI + VFS path + ARXFS write + a tool |
| D142 | the network stack's admin surface carries no message that *retires* an interface | noticed while landing `configure`'s write side; not absorbed. An interface removed from `network.conf` keeps the addressing the stack was last given until the next boot — every other edit now applies live. `configure` and the device manager both state the limit rather than implying otherwise, so nothing reports a success it did not get. Closing it means a framed remove message beside `NetInterfaceConfigMsg`, `Netstack` tearing the interface down (addresses, routes, bond membership, resolver entries) and the two pushers sending it for an alias the document dropped |
| D143 | no `rsa-sha2-*` SSH key support: the only pure-Rust RSA carries an unpatched advisory | noticed while landing `plans/SSH.md` S0a; the algorithm is absent rather than shipped weak. The `rsa` crate carries RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin timing attack) with `patched = []`: as of 2026-09-23, re-checked when `plans/SSH.md` S1 landed, it is unfixed on 0.9.10 and on every 0.10 release candidate through rc.18, the newest `rsa` release (April 2026). Its own advisory text says to avoid it where an attacker can observe timing over the network — which is exactly SSH. §19.3 blocks the dependency and §2.12 forbids hand-rolling the alternative; verify-only does not help, because `cargo deny` flags the crate rather than the call. The cost is a user whose only key is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, and the rare RSA-only host key; stock OpenSSH host keys are Ed25519 by default. **Re-check trigger:** whenever `lib/crypto`'s pins are audited or `plans/SSH.md` advances a stage, confirm whether the advisory has gained a `patched` version — if it has, `plans/SSH.md` S15 unblocks as an ordinary increment |
| D144 | `menu-qemu-aarch64` stalled once at its runtime ceiling with the terminal never launched, and the mechanism is not known | observed once in a full 182-test matrix run on `6f1895cc5`; has not reproduced (standalone 22.4 s, then 25.1 s, then green in a full gate). **Not** load: the guest was alive and idle at the kill (≈8 IPC/s, silent 1.98 s) and 600 s dwarfs the 22 s a pass needs, so it stalled rather than ran slow. Reached `desktop fully revealed` + `first input delivered kind=pointer`, then nothing: no `terminal.app` bundle load and so no `served window first frame on screen`, the gate the rest of the script waits on — the launch click had no effect. The recorded suspicion, that the row click raced the program-library popup, is **disproven**: the popup takes the pointer grab from `is_open()`, i.e. from the model, so a row click delivered before the popup's first present is still hit-tested against the open popup. Leading remaining candidate is `lib/virtio_input`'s documented silent-drop bound (the device discards events when no posted buffer is free; a press/release vanishing mid-burst was seen end to end before the pool went from 8 to 64), whose stated trigger — a click arriving while the desktop re-renders — is exactly what the old script produced by firing the row click during the popup's ~159 ms paint; weak, though, since a 64-deep pool should absorb a burst this small. The six library scripts now gate the row click on the popup's own `program-library popup on screen` witness (id 20015), so no script depends on the question and a recurrence records whether the popup ever reached the screen. Diagnosing it still needs the failing serial log copied aside: `persist_serial` rewrites one path per test |
| D145 | `netstack`'s `accept` scans the whole socket table to find the next unaccepted child, and a spurious `accept` scans it all | noticed while converting the socket bound to measured bytes (`plans/SSH.md` S0b); not absorbed, because it is a second index's worth of design rather than part of that conversion. Every other owned-handle lookup is O(1) through a keyed index; this one is `sockets.iter().position(...)` over the entire table, so a server accepting *n* connections pays O(n²), and the common `WouldBlock` — an `accept` with nothing ready — pays a **full** scan. Remote peers decide how many connections there are to accept, so it is the same "cost follows the table" class the indices were added to remove, reached by a path the owner drives. It is not a correctness or containment defect: the bound still holds and no authority leaks. The fix is not a fifth index but a per-listener FIFO of unaccepted child ids living *inside* the `Proto::Listen` variant, so it is created, drained, and dropped with the listener that owns it and needs no reservation of its own; `accept` then pops a handle and resolves it through `by_id` in constant time. Touches `Proto::Listen`'s shape and every listener site (`to_record`, `defence_counters`, `close`, `listen`, `accept_socket`, `drive_listener`, `advance_listener`, `drain_listener_accepts`, `stream_next_deadline`, `committed_of`, the invariant check). **Re-check trigger:** `plans/SSH.md` S5, whose `sshd` is the tree's first real `accept` consumer and the first workload that would feel it |
| D152 | a panic raised inside the framebuffer console's renderer deadlocks its own report | aarch64, the one port whose kernel renders a framebuffer console, on a release build with a live framebuffer. `SerialSink::write_event` renders through `video::write_bytes`, whose shared `paint` body takes `RENDER_LOCK` blocking, so a fault inside `lib/fbcon` or `paint` with the lock held hangs silently on the record it is emitting; `video::reclaim_surface`'s `try_lock` steps around the hang without fixing the write path. See the Scope bullet |
| D153 | services emit records at a rate an unprivileged client drives | noticed while adding `WINDOW_RETITLED` (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md` DS13); not absorbed. A window opened and closed, a menu opened, a title changed, or a size state asked for once per frame each costs one record through the session's `CAP_LOG_EMIT` (`WINDOW_SIZED` coalesces a burst between two frames into one, so it is at most one per window per frame), so a client holding no log authority can write the journal at frame rate; `netstack`'s `SOCKET_DENIED` and `discoveryd`'s `REQUEST_DENIED` are the same class, one record per refused call at the caller's call rate. Each record is honest and reaches only the diagnostic sink, never the kernel's audit log, and the bound belongs in the log path every service shares — a per-source record budget — rather than in each emitter |
| D154 | graphical drawing outside `lib/controls` still cuts a name where its room runs out, with no mark | noticed while moving every `lib/controls` site onto the shared recipe (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md` DS13); not absorbed. `lib/browse` (`render.rs`, three sites), `userland/apps/{widgets,view,terminal}`, `userland/gui/switchboard` (`view/resources/{mod,pane}.rs`) and `userland/gui/taskbar` (`render.rs`) draw `truncate_to_width`'s prefix alone, against `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §11A. Each becomes `elide_to_width` drawn through `tairix_controls::paint_run`, or through a `lib/font` home for the recipe where a crate sits below `lib/controls`, with a `testkit::marks_elision` regression test per site. The TUI programs' column cuts are the terminal convention and out of scope |
| D155 | the breadcrumb's collapse cell draws a private `...` where every other cut text ends in `…` | blocked on a decision: `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §11 fixes "three periods, not `…`" so the mark renders under any coverage, but the console atlas covers U+2026 (`lib/font`'s `coverage_reaches_beyond_ascii`) and the shipped faces draw it (the Settings vertical's Appearance description ends in `…`). Either the plan's rule is retired and `nav.rs` draws `tairix_font::ELLIPSIS`, or it stands and its rationale is restated; a regression test lands with whichever |
| D164 | 22 userland programs allocate fixed start-up buffers with `vec!`, whose allocation failure panics rather than returning a typed error | a sweep, one program at a time; new code takes `tairix_util::fallible::filled`. See the Scope bullet |
| D166 | x86_64's only platform entropy source is `RDSEED`/`RDRAND`, so a part or hypervisor that does not enumerate them leaves the kernel's random reserve unseeded for the whole boot | noticed when `netstack` began refusing to serve without a keyed SYN-cookie secret, instead of running with an unkeyed one, and every x86_64 network vertical went red: the QEMU harness presented `qemu64`, which has neither instruction, so each x86_64 guest booted `entropy reserve unseeded cause=draw_failed` and every CSPRNG consumer failed closed. The harness now presents both (`tools/qemu/src/x86_64.rs` `CPU`), as current silicon does; that corrects the test machine, not this defect. The kernel still trusts one source alone where the randomness design mixes several (`plans/FIX-RANDOMNESS.md`), so older parts that predate the instructions and hypervisors that mask their CPUID bits get no randomness at all. The fix is a second source the port can always reach, mixed with the first — a seed the boot loader hands over (its UEFI shell can draw one from `EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL`, `plans/BOOTLOADER.md`), and conditioned interrupt-timing jitter — never a fallback to predictable bytes. **Re-check trigger:** the next change to `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/entropy.rs` or to the boot hand-off |
| D168 | the shared device-tree walk emits nodes the firmware marked `status = "disabled"` or `"reserved"`, and drivers bind them | noticed against the pinned Pi 4 tree while designing SND5; not absorbed, because changing the rule can unbind a path metal already accepts. See the section |
| D169 | stable audit event ids collide across components: about thirty are claimed by two or three unrelated emitters | noticed while allocating the D167 ids; not absorbed — the fix is an id registry, a renumbering, and a `ci` uniqueness check. See the section |
| D170 | direct reclaim allocates on the kernel heap, infallibly, on the path memory pressure triggers | noticed while making `LiveSpace::drop`'s walk allocation-free (D167); not absorbed, because the cold scanner's interface changes. See the section |
| D172 | `usb_msd` reads the whole hardware tree into a fixed 8 KiB stack buffer to attribute a stall to a resetting ancestor, and no real tree fits it, so the attribution never runs | noticed while widening the node to sixteen resources (`plans/SOUND.md` SND5a), which shrank the buffer's reach from fourteen nodes to nine; not absorbed, because the fix is a kernel-side fold or a shared growing snapshot reader. See the section |
| D175 | memory below a narrow DMA ceiling has no reserve: ordinary allocations drain it first-come, so a constrained carve late on a busy machine is refused while RAM above the ceiling is free | noticed while making constrained carves deterministic (D173); not absorbed, because the fix is address zones sized from discovery, with a reserve, on every port. See the section |
| D202 | a limited `dma_alloc` scans the frame bitmap under the global allocator lock | noticed merging the DMA engine; not absorbed. `alloc_order_under` walks the bitmap below the ceiling holding the frame-allocator lock, O(frames) on fragmented RAM for every carve with an address limit |
| D203 | a DMA carve no window can name is still zeroed and mapped | noticed merging the DMA engine; not absorbed. `alloc_dma_region` ignores a translated window's lower CPU bound, so when nothing inside the window fits it still carves, zeroes up to `2^MAX_ORDER` pages, maps and unmaps before `translate_device_addr` refuses — always, for the Pi's peripheral window |
| D204 | DMA controller resolution re-walks the device tree per consumer phandle | noticed merging the DMA engine; not absorbed. `resolve_dma_controller` walks the whole tree for each distinct phandle of each consumer, O(nodes × consumers); one pre-pass building a phandle-to-id map is the fix |
| D205 | `HW_NODE_MAX_RESOURCES` is a fixed ceiling raised for one node type | noticed merging the DMA engine; not absorbed. Raising it from 8 to 16 grew every node from 577 to 833 bytes to fit the DMA controller; a node's resource set should scale with what it carries rather than take the widest node's size. Past the ceiling the walk drops a node's further resources without a record, so its driver binds a partial set unannounced (found reviewing D167's change, when the ceiling was 8) |
| D206 | `dma_ranges_aperture_of` folds a multi-entry `dma-ranges` into one translation | noticed merging the DMA engine; not absorbed. It reports the lowest entry's child base for the whole span, wrong for every other entry; no caller reads it translated today, and `dma_reach` is the correct composition |
| D211 | the fatal-fault verticals repeat the harness's build glue | noticed merging the fault-path rework; not absorbed. Their `build.rs` files repeat the linker-script stanza, one of 53 copies in the tree (the x86_64 fatal-fault pair now share `x86_64_guest_build`). The boot-stack guard check it also named is one `CpuStateCapture::boot_stack_verdict` since D181 |
| D214 | two identity-gated window requests refuse without an audit record | noticed merging the desktop idle work; not absorbed. `QueryNotifySources` and `LockScreen` answer `PermissionDenied` with no stable `lib/log` event, where the desktop-layer gate records `LAYER_REFUSED` |
| D216 | desktop controls allocate per pointer event and per paint | noticed merging the desktop idle work; not absorbed. `FlagSet::flag_rects` builds two `Vec`s on every pointer event and hit test, and `PermsSection::new` makes about twenty allocations on every paint, press and key. Partial: the screensaver half is closed — only the dimmed screensaver builds `backdrop_ground` |
| D217 | Settings waits on the desktop from its event loop | noticed merging the desktop idle work; not absorbed. It calls `notify_sources` and `lock_screen` synchronously over the window channel; the session answers from memory, but the interactive loop still waits on another service |
| D223 | the kernel's shared-region and call registries are global statics | noticed merging the DMA engine; not absorbed. `sharedreg::REGIONS` and `callreg` keep their state in global `SpinLock` statics the syscall and teardown paths reach directly; the owned-registry shape `PeerWatch` took, injected where it is used, is the fix |
| D224 | the tree has two secure-wipe primitives: the `zeroize` crate (a direct dependency of 12 crates) and the first-party `tairix_util::secret` (`wipe`, `Wiped`; used by nine crates, among them `kernel/core`, `lib/rt`, and `netstack`) | noticed while moving `lib/sandbox`'s session queue onto `lib/collections`' `ByteQueue`, which wipes through `zeroize` where the queue it replaced wiped through `lib/util`. Both are volatile stores behind a fence, so neither is weaker; the defect is that one job has two implementations, and their stated reasons contradict each other — `lib/log` and `lib/rng` chose `zeroize` for "no hand-rolled wiping", while `lib/util` is exactly a hand-rolled wipe. Needs a decision on which is canonical before a sweep: `zeroize` stays in the graph either way, because `lib/crypto`'s audited cipher crates depend on it, and the charter otherwise prefers the first-party one. Then every consumer moves to the one, and the other is deleted. **Re-check trigger:** the next crate that needs to wipe a secret |
| D228 | a grab does not hand the seat back as it found it | a key pressed before a menu chain, the lock or the screensaver takes the keys is released into the grab, so the application that saw the press keeps it held. Needs the grab-entry contract decided first: what the focused surface is told when the seat is taken mid-press. Partial: the pointer half is closed — the drains behind the lock and the screensaver follow the device into the shell's tracked pointer (`track_pointer`), which the window manager adopts on the stream's return, pinned by `the_pointer_follows_the_device_behind_the_screensaver` and `the_pointer_follows_the_device_at_the_lock`. The seat's modifier state already crosses a grab: every keyboard drain goes through `DesktopShell::poll_key`. Noticed fixing `plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D34 |
| D229 | the seat's pointer and keyboard channels carry no shared order or time | two independent rings in `kernel/core/src/seat.rs`, no per-seat sequence or arrival stamp: the desktop cannot restore their interleaving, so under load keys typed into one window before a click on another reach the window the click focused, and every timed gesture (hold, double-click, key-repeat start) is measured when the desktop processes it — a stalled desktop reads a tap as a hold. Fix: a sequence and arrival stamp per record on the `pointer_read`/`keyboard_read` drain, merged in order by the session. Noticed fixing `plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D34 |
| D241 | an orderly removal leaves its driver's DMA memory quarantined for the boot | noticed revoking D230's grants; not absorbed — needs an orderly-removal protocol that stops the driver first, or a parent-attested quiesce. See the section |
| D242 | the kernel binary keeps `static mut` state (the boot heap in each port, x86_64's boot stacks) | noticed sweeping citation residue; not absorbed — linker-reserved memory for all three ports at once. See the section |
| D243 | the device manager never learns that a driver died, so a crashed or failed-closed driver's device stays undriven | noticed with the devmgr review; not absorbed — needs the driver's `ProcId` in the store's load reply and a tree-plus-exit wait. See the section |
| D244 | MSI vectors are never freed | noticed revoking D230's MSI grants; not absorbed — a free in each port's producer. See the section |
| D245 | a re-plugged NIC or audio device can be handed no channel | noticed with the devmgr review; not absorbed — interface retirement in `netstack` and `audiod`. See the section |
| D246 | writable-root configuration is not re-read after the root unlocks | noticed with the devmgr review; not absorbed. See the section |
| D247 | the ports disagree on a partial boot hardware tree | noticed with the devmgr review; not absorbed. See the section |
| D252 | no oracle can interpret the virtio drivers' tests | noticed fixing D251; not absorbed — the mock peer needs provenance-carrying access. See the section |
| D261 | an endpoint grant names a numeric id another binding can take | noticed fixing D260; not absorbed — endpoint authority tied to one binding. See the section |
| D263 | an unplug and re-plug folded into one root-port change is taken for a glitch | noticed fixing D235; not absorbed — needs the port-enable check, a rescan mark, and the SuperSpeed case. See the section |
| D267 | `docs-check` has no stale-symbol check | noticed closing D226; not absorbed. The charter's `docs-check` fails a `docs/src/` page that names a symbol which no longer exists; `run_docs_check` builds rustdoc and the book and checks relative links, and nothing else, which is how D266's page names deleted modules without failing |
| D268 | the disk-image sector is still defined beside the one the disk authors share | `tools/mkimage`, the encrypted-root fixture and the kernel's root-mount tests take `tairix_syshelp::SECTOR_BYTES`, but `tools/qemu` (which plants those images), the `arxfs_image` and `posix_fs_suite` fixtures and `virtio_qemu_support` each carry their own `512`, so an image's author and the tool that plants it can drift apart. Needs deciding which of the tree's other `512`s are that quantity and which are genuinely their own (the virtio-blk wire sector, a FAT volume's chosen bytes-per-sector, a mock device's block). Noticed merging the `/System` sizing change; not absorbed |
| D271 | the driver-store unload's immediate path tears a driver down through its own inline copy of the process teardown, which omits half of it | noticed fixing D269; not absorbed, because routing it through the shared landing needs the landing seam in `KernelInitSpawner`, whose constructor a dozen QEMU test kernels call. `terminate_driver_process` retires each quiesced thread and then reclaims shared memory, endpoints, wait-sets, IRQ lines, the address space and the record itself; the exit teardown (`reclaim_process_resources`) additionally cancels the calls the driver posted on other endpoints, tears down its async ports, releases its futex keys, cpufreq role, seats and console foreground, prunes its wait rows, and audits the DMA memory it leaves to the quarantine. A driver still running when unloaded takes the full path through its deferred landing, so one unload reclaims different state depending on timing, and the immediate path leaves a USB class driver's queued transfer on its controller's endpoint and its ports bound. What it leaves is keyed by the driver's number, so a successor drawing that number would own the ports, reap the replies to the calls the driver posted, and hold its cpufreq role; since D269 the immediate path therefore never returns the number to the draw, a containment that costs one held id per such unload until this is fixed. The seam's own rustdoc already names the driver unload as one of the deaths `land_thread_down` serves |
| D272 | a hand-over the instance's mailbox refuses after the session relayed its document leaves the onward delegation pending in the instance's table | noticed fixing D133; not absorbed, because the fix is a kernel mechanism a grantor withdraws an unredeemed delegation through. `DeskReach::queue_open_target` redeems the session's grant and mints the instance its own before `hand_over` queues the entry; a refused queue answers `false`, which the launch contract reads as "nothing delegated", yet the instance's handle stays pending until it or the session exits. D133's per-grantor bound caps the residue at 64 per instance, charged to the session. The fix is either a withdraw operation on a delegation the caller minted, or a desk that reserves its slot before the relay mints |
| D273 | a signal intake a non-leader thread opts into is never used: the opt-in, the take and the wait-set readiness are keyed by the calling thread, while delivery and its targeted wake are keyed by the process | noticed fixing D270; not absorbed, because keying the intake by process needs a wake that reaches whichever thread waits, not the leader's task id. `signal_intake` and `WaitSourceKind::Signal` use `caller.task_id`, `try_intake` and `signal_intake_wake` the target `ProcessId`, and `threads::retire` clears the retiring thread's own entry; so only a leader can observe a termination request, and a request aimed at a process whose worker opted in terminates it instead. The docs already describe one intake per process |
| D284 | riscv64's remote fence has no fail-closed outcome when the firmware refuses the last resort | noticed fixing D281; not absorbed, because either answer changes a contract the charter guards. `fence_remote` answers a refused fence with a whole-space fence of every hart, the most permissive call the SBI has, and drops that call's status: `CrossCpuTlbShootdown` is infallible, so an `SBI_ERR_FAILED` there returns as though every hart had fenced, and the caller frees frames a stale translation may still reach. The fix is either a fallible shootdown whose failure keeps the batch's frames out of the allocator (`Retiring` already withholds a frame it cannot scrub), which widens the Arch HAL on every port for a failure only one can produce, or a stop-the-world fatal report stating the reason, which halts on a production path |
| D294 | a scheduler's overflow list still grows infallibly on the wake and yield paths | noticed fixing D291; not absorbed. See the section |
| D297 | every syscall entry and exit, and every user fault, takes the one global kill-gate spin lock and inserts into or removes from a shared B-tree | noticed fixing D296; not absorbed, because the fix is per-thread gate state reached without a global structure. See the section. The insert also allocates on the fault path, so an exhausted heap aborts the kernel there rather than failing the entry |
| D298 | a run ending on one CPU takes another CPU's dispatch of the same task for its own and requeues or parks it | noticed reviewing the merge of `1925ac852`; not absorbed. `park::settle` decides from the state word alone, and a remote park then wake can queue the task where another CPU sets it `Running` while its body still runs here: a `Yield` then queues it a second time and a `Park` parks a task that is about to run. D286 closed the case where the re-queued entry was not yet picked. Wants a per-run owner that pick and steal respect, and a multi-CPU conformance case |
| D299 | the shootdown and doom handshakes merged in `1cffc66b6` and `1925ac852` have no loom model, and `kthread.rs`'s new `unsafe` has had no miri run | noticed reviewing the merge; not absorbed. `ActiveCpus::enter` against `SpaceTlb::shoot_remote` and `doom` against `observe_doom` are store-then-load pairings fenced on both sides, and neither `tairix-kernel-mem` nor `tairix-kernel-sched-api` is in `loom`'s targets; `tairix-kernel-core` is outside `miri`'s |
| D300 | compress-out shoots down and takes the registry write lock once per page, inside the global tier lock | noticed reviewing the merge of `1cffc66b6`; not absorbed and unmeasured. Reclaiming `n` pages costs `n` synchronous IPI rounds with every other CPU's fault path waiting on the tier lock; the batching `Retiring` offers is not used there |
| D302 | x86_64 serialises every targeted user shootdown through one mailbox | noticed reviewing the merge of `1cffc66b6`; not absorbed and unmeasured. The single `SHOOTDOWN` mailbox now serves every unmap in a multi-CPU process as well as heap teardown and revocation |
| D307 | the wasm32 preemption clock keeps its frame times in two per-instance atomic statics | blocked on a decision: the two records the merge of `1925ac852` overstated are corrected, and what remains is whether the port may keep them. They are per-context by construction — each Web Worker is its own wasm instance, and the host's frame callback re-enters with no context — exactly as the port's callback, CPU-id and tick statics already are, but the charter bans global mutable statics outright. The static-free shape moves the frame clock into the host glue, which owns the frame loop, or hands every entry a context; either reshapes the port's host interface |
| D309 | 28 command bundles accept a `--help` their `Help/` never documents, and nothing holds a parser to its documented switch keys | noticed fixing the same drift in `wintersun` (`plans/WINTERSUN.md` WS23); not absorbed, because the fix is the check `plans/APPS.md` §3.1 promises — every switch a parser accepts is in `en-US/`'s `OPTIONS`, and vice versa — where `lib/help`'s lint holds only each translation to `en-US/`. The parsers of `session`, `top`, `tee`, `cat`, `man`, `vim`, `basename`, `servicectl`, `users`, `sysinfo`, `elsh`, `whoami`, `configure`, `sleep`, `seq`, `reset`, `wc`, `applib`, `printf`, `tail`, `head`, `clear`, `edit`, `files`, `dirname`, `yes`, `sysmon` and `ps` take `--help` while every locale documents `-h, -?`. Wants each command app's accepted switches exported for the lint to compare, then each key corrected in every locale |
| D310 | the freestanding bodies of the `tests/integration` kernels and guest programs are clippy-linted on no target | noticed fixing D301; not absorbed. `target_clippy` lints `kernel/`, `lib/`, `drivers/` and `userland/` alone, and on the host these crates build as stubs, so their real code is linted nowhere. The fifteen test kernels D301 touched carry 17 target-clippy errors between them (functions past the length cap, `let…else` rewrites); `threads_program`'s four were fixed there. Wants `tests/integration` enrolled in `target_clippy` and the debt it surfaces cleared |
| D317 | WinterSun's reference-scene mode solves every newly visible chunk on its event loop on each resize | noticed reviewing the merge of `ac3ecbb5d`; not absorbed. `run.rs`'s resize path reaches `reference.rs`'s `hold_ground`, tens of milliseconds per chunk before the window answers input again, where play mode hands the same work to a worker |
| D318 | WinterSun play mode asks again every frame for a chunk it could not hold for lack of memory, and drops the pacer's ticks when it cannot borrow the ground | noticed reviewing the merge of `ac3ecbb5d`; not absorbed. A chunk `HeldGround::adopt` refuses is dropped without entering `refused`, so `request_visible` re-solves it each frame for as long as memory stays short, and `simulate` discards the ticks silently when `ground.borrow()` fails |
| D323 | WinterSun repeats its loop and session set-up rather than sharing them | noticed reviewing the merge of `ac3ecbb5d`; not absorbed. `reference_loop` restates `run_loop`'s wait, serve and drain block, the `Session` literal is built twice (`main` and `reference_scene`), and `short_help` is one more copy of the per-application wrapper |
| D325 | an application is never told the pointer left its window, so whatever it last lit for the pointer stays lit | noticed reworking the Settings shell's pointer routing; not absorbed — needs a window-channel leave event every client handles. See the section |
| D326 | the Settings window presents nothing for a round that submitted an elevation, so a verdict answered on the loop's own thread waits for the next event to show | noticed adding the Settings hover replay; not absorbed — its regression test needs the run loop's repaint decision made host-testable. See the section |
| D327 | a pixel-scrolled list cannot lay out a row that starts past 2^31 pixels, so a directory of more than some 97 million entries loses its end | noticed moving every scrolling list to pixel offsets; not absorbed — needs the shared scroll view to lay lines out from the first one it shows. See the section |
| D331 | riscv64's `KernelArch::current_cpu` scans the whole `cpu_to_hartid` table for the running hart on every call | noticed closing D210; not absorbed. O(CPUs) on the scheduler's hot paths, and an unmapped hart falls back to the boot CPU's id, which misattributes a report taken there. The map lives in the arch instance, so the port's own reports cannot reach it and name `hart=` instead. The fix is a per-hart word holding the dense id — `tp` itself, or a slot the trap anchor already carries — with the hart id kept in the table the SBI calls index |
| D332 | the syscall dispatch slot is copied into every port's `syscall_entry.rs`, and the kernel binary's per-port dispatch shims are identical | noticed closing D180; not absorbed. `SyscallDispatchFn`, its `FnCell` and the install/getter pair are the same on all three ports, and `production_dispatch`, `production_user_fault` and `production_user_fault_terminate` differ only in the port each names. The D180 fix for the syscall slot: the slot beside `tairix_arch_api::fault`, and the shims once in `dispatch_core` over one `DISPATCH_SLOT` |
| D334 | the pinned rustc (`nightly-2026-07-03`) can segfault nondeterministically, failing a gate stage with no defect in the tree | noticed running the fault-path gate; not absorbed. rustc read address `0x11` in `rustc_mir_transform::validate` while encoding `crypto-bigint` 0.7.5's metadata in `fuzz --once`. The identical invocation (same `-C metadata`) built later in the same run and 1024 times in a 16-way parallel replay, and it is the only rustc segfault the build host's kernel log holds. It is not a stack overflow (a shallow backtrace, a near-null address), a stale cache (the run started clean) or memory exhaustion. Before a gate failure reading `rustc interrupted by SIGSEGV` is attributed to the tree, `journalctl -k` is checked for its `segfault` record and `target/` for the artefact its `-C extra-filename` names. Closed by a toolchain bump whose gate runs clean, or an upstream report with a reproducer |
| D335 | the Settings bundle's twelve translated help pages lack three of its `en-US` page's paragraphs — Appearance and Accessibility, Storage, Users & Groups — and its Sound and Theme examples, against `plans/APPS.md` §8.1 | noticed updating the help for the sidebar's independent lists and tree keys (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md` DS17), whose own sentences reached every locale; not absorbed — the stages that added those paragraphs updated `en-US/` alone. Closed by translating them into every required locale, with a `help-lint` rule that fails a translation carrying fewer top-level paragraphs than its canonical document as the regression check. **Wider than Settings.** A structure lint — each translation carries `en-US/`'s sections and, in each, as many paragraphs, lists of as many items and tables of as many rows, in order, compared in `lib/help`'s `lint_help_trees` beside the switch-key drift — fails 180 translations: every one of the 12 locales of `terminal`, `tail`, `sysmon`, `sysinfo`, `ss`, `settings`, `ping`, `ls`, `ln`, `fstree`, `flock`, `files`, `cp`, `configure` and `cat`, roughly 5,000 untranslated English words per locale (`fstree` and `configure` are under two thirds covered). The lint lands with the translation sweep, since landing it first fails the gate |
| D345 | a child the kernel itself admits — a driver of the bootstrap floor — is registered against `ProcessId(0)`, which nothing on a booted system reaps, so each such exit leaves a zombie row holding its pid | noticed while placing admissions in sessions; not absorbed. The QEMU chassis reap these rows with `poll(ProcessId(0), …)`, so registering them parentless breaks every vertical that does; the fix moves those chassis to the exit record the device manager needs for D243 |
| D353 | the step from a layout `Rect` to the unsigned surface rectangle a paint takes is written out at about 25 sites across `lib/*` and `userland/*`, and they disagree off-surface | noticed reviewing the merge of `4d9882014`; not absorbed. `lib/controls`' `surface_rect` refuses a rectangle whose origin is above or left of the surface; `lib/browse`, `decision.rs`'s `band_origin`, `userland/apps/settings/src/footer.rs` and `userland/apps/view/src/run.rs` clamp that origin to zero and keep the width, so a partly off-surface rectangle is drawn shifted rather than cut; the terminal keeps two private copies of its own. The fix is one conversion on `tairix_geometry::Rect` that clips to the surface, with every site moved onto it and each off-surface case pinned. **Blocked on a decision.** A survey found 60 production sites plus the 82 callers of `lib/controls`' `surface_rect`, and clipping is right only for writes a rectangle merely confines — a fill, a clip window, a damage rectangle. A shape — a rounded plate, a ring, a frost, a gradient — computes its coverage from its own origin, so clipping its rectangle redraws its corners at the cut edge. The conversion that is right for both is a signed placement: a `Surface` operation that states the part of a negative origin as a `with_origin` offset and paints at the non-negative remainder, so the shape is drawn whole and the buffer keeps the part on the surface. Which of the two the sweep takes is open |
| D363 | no audited hardware crypto backend — AES-NI, SHA-NI, CLMUL, the ARMv8 crypto extensions, AVX2 ChaCha — is reachable on any TAIRiX target | each RustCrypto crate detects through `cpufeatures`, which on `os = none` answers only compile-time features, and a raised floor would drop every part below it; TAIRiX may not transcribe the primitives. See the section |
| D368 | `desktop-pressure-qemu-aarch64` once ran past its 600 s runtime ceiling in a full QEMU matrix, still writing output when it was killed, where alone it passes in 28 s | seen once, in a full pre-gate matrix; its serial log and `hang.txt` did not survive, so the cause is unknown. D54's worker storm, which starved every concurrent reader on this class of vertical, is an unconfirmed candidate. It closes on a root cause alone, and a recurrence keeps both files for the diagnosis |
| D370 | a file on the encrypted root is held twice in RAM, as ciphertext blocks in the boot disk's `BlockCache` and as plaintext chunks in its volume's `CachedFs`, and a cold read copies it through both | found measuring Settings' wallpaper reads; not absorbed. Both are reclaimable `CleanFileData`, so the cost is memory and one copy per block, not correctness. The block cache is what keeps the three windows onto the one disk coherent (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` SMART11), so keeping file data out of it is **a decision**: admit only filesystem metadata below the volume layer, or keep both |
| D373 | the minimal clock's time cannot reach its share of the screen above 1765 px of height: its type is held to the font service's 512 px glyph bound, so at 3840×2160 it is 23.7% of the height rather than 29%, and the date shrinks with it while both baselines stay put | found reviewing the ribbon screensaver; not absorbed. The glyph bound is a containment bound and stays. **A decision:** letter the time at the bound and scale the block up to its share, or lay the whole face out from the capped size |
| D374 | while the compositor keeps no content — released under memory pressure — the ribbon repaints the whole screen every frame, summing and toning every sample row though its layout already marks about 60% of them black, and each strip still paints as three chunks (16, 16 and 1 columns) | found reviewing the ribbon screensaver; not absorbed. Filling the rows no column of a chunk reaches with black, and folding a strip's single leading column into its first chunk, would cut that work; each is measured by the sums and writes a frame makes rather than by wall time |
| D376 | the signed driver-image fixture — sign a manifest, emit its image, trust anchor and syscall-table hash — is re-rolled in 19 vertical `build.rs` files, while `tairix_itest_harness::driver_image::build_signed_driver_image` serves two | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed: 19 scripts across three ports, each re-verified on QEMU. The fix is one harness fixture writer over `build_signed_driver_image`, taking the image constant's name and the capability set, whose output is byte-identical to each script's |
| D377 | the x86_64 kernel's promise never to execute VEX rests on `cpufeatures` answering only compile-time features on `os = none`, and nothing tests that a task's YMM, ZMM or opmask state survives the kernel | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. The RustCrypto AVX2 backends are compiled into the kernel since their `soft` pins went, so a `cpufeatures` that probed CPUID would run them under a task's live upper halves and could leave key material there. `fp_isolation` checks only the low 64 bits of `xmm` under yield-only switching, and `entry_hygiene` ignores FP. The test: a `-cpu max` vertical whose task fills its YMM, ZMM and `k` state, drives kernel crypto and a preemption, and reads it all back unchanged |
| D378 | the x86_64 switch-in hooks repoint the entry stacks of `BOOT_CPU` rather than of the CPU resuming the thread | latent: production x86_64 runs one CPU. Before it brings up a second, the core must hand every port's `ProcessResume` hook the resuming CPU, since reading the LAPIC per switch costs an exit under virtualisation |
| D379 | the session maps a client's whole granted region, so a client can make it map far more than the preview it asked for | noticed reviewing a merge; admission now precedes the map, but `shm_map_from` takes no length bound. The fix is a maximum length on `shm_map_from`, refused kernel-side, across its callers |
| D380 | a refused Settings-only window request is audited every time it is made, so an app can flood the audit trail at will | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. The audit stream is deliberately never rate-limited, so the answer is producer-side coalescing — one record per refusing peer per interval, carrying a count — which is a `plans/SYSLOG.md` decision |
| D381 | the x86_64 and riscv64 FP-state work carries unswept duplication and stale prose: the QEMU CPU string written twice, an `alloc_format` wrapper, three near-identical `qemu_tests` rows, the 15-register push/pop written five times, a misattached riscv dispatch doc, a duplicated SAFETY block, a self-correcting comment, and a dead probe loop | noticed reviewing a merge; raised with the user as its own sweep of that code, with its verticals re-run |
| D382 | a kernel translation fault in the Pi 4's root-unlock kernel thread printed no fault report: the UART stopped at the last queued line and the machine sat silent | found bringing EMMC2 up on metal (D383's fault); not absorbed. The fatal path flushes its report before parking (`flush_console_blocking`), so something between the vector and that flush never finished — the stop of the other CPUs, or a second fault inside the report that met the one-shot fatal latch and parked. Needs a deliberate kernel fault on metal to localise. See the section |
| D383 | the aarch64 root-unlock reached its DMA pools through the sparse boot identity window, which maps only the kernel's physically-addressed gigapages, so a carve anywhere else faulted when it was zeroed | found bringing EMMC2 up on metal: the constrained staging carve landed in gigapage 2. Fixed in the change that found it — DMA through the kernel's direct map, register windows through the identity window's Device gigapages (`DeviceWindows`) — and proven on metal. **Open for its regression test**, which QEMU cannot yet give. See the section |
| D384 | a grant a process delegated outlives it: a recipient keeps a grant for every grantor instance and resource it was ever given, so a long-lived server's table, and the scan each mint makes of it, grows with every client it outlives | noticed reviewing a merge that keyed delegated grants by grantor; not absorbed, since when a delegated grant must end — grantor exit, region teardown, or both — is a grant-lifecycle decision. See the section |
| D385 | TextEdit's, Paint's and the viewer's `-h` can never read their own Help: the own-bundle help source opens `Help/` through `fs_open`, which needs `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, and all three deliberately hold no filesystem capability | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. Granting `CAP_FS_ACCESS` would hand each the whole filesystem for a help page; the fix is a read path to a program's own bundle, which is a design decision. See the section |
| D386 | on AMD parts before Zen 2 the x87 scrub leaves the last-instruction and last-data pointers naming kernel text and data, which the next task reads with `FNSTENV` | noticed reviewing a merge; no slide leaks while x86_64 links at a fixed base, but it defeats KASLR once x86_64 has it. Not absorbed: the fix cannot be confirmed without that silicon. See the section |
| D387 | the session copies and checks up to a 16 MiB clipboard payload on its serve loop, per set and per get, and maps the client's whole granted region to do it | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. The map is D379's route; the copy belongs off the loop the desktop is drawn from |
| D388 | the document host's job-room accounting and its re-resolving of a window after an input that may close it have no test, and no QEMU vertical covers TextEdit, Paint, the clipboard, a drag onto the icon bar, or the Save picker | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. Both editors now run in `tairix_window::docapp`'s host, which is freestanding-only because its windows are `WindowPane`s over live frame regions; testing it on the host needs the pane behind a seam the loopback transport can serve, or a guest vertical per editor |
| D389 | a refused enrolment write reaches `servicectl` as the store's own errno, so a store code that coincides with one the manager gives its own meaning (`NotFound`, `Busy`, `LimitExceeded`) is reported with the wrong reason | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. The fix is a reply that says the record could not be written apart from carrying why, so the tool never has to guess from the code |
| D390 | PID 1 adopts the administrator's enrolment overrides only if they are readable within about 63 s of boot; unlocked later, the disabled services run all boot, and the next `servicectl enable`/`disable` rebuilds the document from an empty base, erasing every earlier decision | **high**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `init/src/run.rs` `OVERRIDE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` ends the ladder; `manager.rs` `enrol_control` writes `overrides_for(&self.vendor, &desired)` from the unadopted layer. Adoption needs an event the unlock raises, and a write must refuse, or re-read, while the on-disk layer is unadopted |
| D391 | any process can restart a stopped or disabled service that declares no connect capability, through the open activation endpoint — `timed`, with `CAP_TIME_SET`, among them | **high**; noticed reviewing a merge; predates it, but defeats its enable/disable outcomes. `init/src/manager.rs` `connect` activates any `Stopped`/`Inactive` registered service whatever its activation mode or enrolment. A connect must refuse a service not enrolled, and one not on-demand |
| D392 | `write_overrides` syncs the staged document before the rename and nothing after it, so an enable/disable `servicectl` reported as recorded is lost to a crash within the filesystem's dirty-age window | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `init/src/run.rs` `write_overrides`; the ARXFS rename stays in the open transaction for up to 30 s on SD/eMMC. The rename needs its own commit barrier before the outcome is reported |
| D393 | disabling a service that a late-read override enabled but that was never registered fails with exit 1 and files a spurious `ACTIVATION_DENIED`; enabling it answers "already enabled" without starting it | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `init/src/manager.rs` `enact_enrolment` calls `stop` on a name `adopt_overrides` never registered |
| D394 | the service-manager docs disagree with the code: `docs/src/userland/init.md` on a corrupt store, `docs/src/lib/users.md`'s 512-byte line cap against `MAX_LINE_LEN` 1024, `init/src/lib.rs`'s manifest decode that no longer exists, `servicectl`'s `Exit::Failed` rustdoc, and `audiod/src/region.rs`'s `BufferTooSmall` where the code returns `LengthOutOfRange` | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed |
| D395 | the `shm_grant` and `shm_grant_peer` docs still send a delegated grant's recipient to `shm_map`, which now refuses it, so a third-party C server written from them always gets `TAIRIX_E_NOT_FOUND` | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. In `lib/abi` (`syscall.rs`, the net and audio channel and `raid_ipc` docs), `lib/rt` (`shm_grant`, `shm_grant_peer`, `MappedGrant`) and `lib/abi-sys`; the recipient's call is `shm_map_from` |
| D396 | `lib/vcmailbox`'s `decode_gpio_state_write_response` reads the tag's value word before rejecting a zero-length tag, so a malformed firmware reply ending on the message's last word panics the kernel during EMMC2 bring-up | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `locate_tag` may return `at = PROPERTY_WORDS - 3` with no buffer, and `words[at + 3]` is read inside the match tuple. The length check must come before the read, with a regression test on that reply |
| D397 | EMMC2 chooses Auto-CMD23 from the card's SCR alone, so on an SDHCI 2.00 host, where that transfer mode is reserved, every multi-block transfer is left open | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; cannot occur on the BCM2711 the driver binds. `drivers/storage/emmc2/src/lib.rs` with `bringup.rs`; the choice needs the host's version too |
| D398 | EMMC2 computes the next block address after an I/O's last chunk and never bounds the CSD's `C_SIZE`, so on a card of 2^32 blocks an I/O ending at the last block lands and is then reported `LengthOutOfRange` | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `drivers/storage/emmc2/src/lib.rs` (`at.checked_add(blocks)`) and `command.rs` `geometry_from_csd` |
| D399 | EMMC2's speed ladder repeats the identical 3.3 V High Speed bring-up when a UHS-capable card that refused the 1.8 V switch steps down a rung | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; failure path only. `drivers/storage/emmc2/src/bringup.rs` |
| D400 | EMMC2 exports `pub mod card` and `pub mod host`, widening the driver's public surface beyond `register` for no outside consumer and contradicting its README | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `drivers/storage/emmc2/src/lib.rs` |
| D401 | `brcm,bcm2711-emmc2` is written twice, in `kernel/arch/aarch64/src/platform.rs` and the EMMC2 driver, so changing one leaves the card bound without its DMA window and SD supply | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; the GENET and PCIe strings share the pattern |
| D402 | the EMMC2 README still says "metal pending" where `plans/PI.md` P8 records UHS-I DDR50 with ADMA2 accepted on metal | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed |
| D403 | a new-name Save As creates its file on the picker's worker before the pick concludes, so a cancel or a refused delegation leaves an empty file under the typed name | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/gui/session/src/picker.rs` (`PickAccess::save_flags`, `opened`) and `run.rs` `settle_pick` |
| D404 | a system-modal prompt does not block a drag though the session's docs say it does, so a drag carried over a prompt swallows the keys meant for it | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/gui/session/src/windows.rs`: `seat_held` counts only the lock and the picker |
| D405 | `DragEnded` and `PreviewRendered` conclusions are never shed, so a client that stops draining can hold more than `HOLD_BACK_CAPACITY` events, contradicting the hold-back's stated bound | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; still bounded by the client's render limit. `userland/gui/session/src/holdback.rs` |
| D406 | TextEdit's Whole Word search can match inside a word where a 16 MiB search step splits a multi-byte character, and in hex mode where the selection ends inside one | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/find.rs`: a step starts at a raw byte offset |
| D407 | TextEdit records an edit's undo with allocations that cannot fail, after the document has already changed, so an allocation failure aborts the app with its unsaved work | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/history.rs` and `document.rs`, reached from `editor.rs` `Editor::edit` |
| D408 | TextEdit repaints only the edited line when an edit keeps the line-feed count, so hex rows after an inserted or deleted byte, and text rows below a line whose row count changed, keep stale pixels | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs` `damage_hex_rows` and `Lines::of` |
| D409 | TextEdit's drag auto-scroll moves the view but repaints only the selection's rows, so rows scrolled past keep their old pixels | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs` `drag_to`, `nudge` |
| D410 | a TextEdit line-ending conversion whose step returns partial re-queues itself over a newer conversion of the same kind, silently dropping the user's last choice | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/run.rs` `queue`, `converted` |
| D411 | TextEdit's find and replace fields have no length bound, so a large paste is drawn on every find-bar repaint and each Find builds an up-to-64 MiB needle with an allocation that cannot fail before refusing it | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs`; the fields need the pattern's own 1024-byte bound |
| D412 | TextEdit never repaints a check's problem underline: a newly reported problem is not underlined, and a fixed one stays underlined | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `view.rs` `checked` repaints only the gutter and the status band |
| D413 | TextEdit's horizontal extent does not grow as wider rows scroll into view, as its rustdoc says, because `scroll_to` never measures | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs` |
| D414 | closing TextEdit's find bar during a search leaves "Searching…" in the status band until the next edit | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs` `close_find` |
| D415 | moving focus between TextEdit's find and replace fields with the pointer does not repaint the find bar, so the field that lost focus keeps its caret and focus ring | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs` `find_pointer` |
| D416 | TextEdit maps an edit's old selection through the already-edited document, so an undo above the selection can leave a stale highlight | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/view.rs` `report` |
| D417 | TextEdit's status band cuts its format and position readouts mid-digit: the format slot is sized for "System configuration" but "Network configuration" is wider, the position slot fits neither ", N selected" nor the hex offset, and nothing ellipsises | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `userland/apps/textedit/src/layout.rs` and `paint.rs` |
| D418 | TextEdit's README lists its capabilities without `CAP_LOG_EMIT`, which its `AppInfo` requests | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed |
| D419 | the generated C headers publish no AppInfo flag bits: `tairix_appinfo.h` carries a `flags` word with no macros for `APPINFO_FLAG_NO_ICON_BAR`, `APPINFO_FLAG_MULTI_INSTANCE`, the new `APPINFO_FLAG_DOCUMENT_WRITE`, or `APPINFO_FLAG_MASK`, so a C tool must hard-code them and the drift guard cannot see a renumbering | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `tools/xtask/src/commands/c_header.rs`'s AppInfo section and its pin test; the bits are `lib/abi/src/appinfo.rs`'s |
| D420 | `AppManifestSource::parse`'s `# Errors` list omits the refusal of an unknown `document-access` value | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `tests/integration/harness/src/app_image.rs` |
| D421 | `tairix-appstore` sits in `tools/xtask`'s `[dependencies]` under a comment claiming a production use, though its one use is in `qemu_tests.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)]` module | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. It belongs with xtask's other test-only crates in `[dev-dependencies]` |
| D427 | `Slider`'s cap and its stops disagree everywhere but `request`: `set_value` and `with_stops` snap after clamping and can land above the cap, and `with_cap` clamps without snapping, so a key can move the value the wrong way | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; latent, since no caller combines a cap with stops. `set_value(900)` under a 950 cap with five stops sits at 1000; `new(1000).with_stops(5).with_cap(600)` rests off a stop at 600 and Right settles at 500. One private seating step (clamp, snap, take the stop beneath a cap) belongs in all four, with a regression test over those cases. `lib/controls/src/value.rs` |
| D428 | `Slider::stop_value` floors where `stop_of` rounds, so past 502 gaps a stop's own value maps back to the stop beneath and a key can no longer step past it | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; latent, since the Settings sliders take at most nine stops. With 1000 stops, Right from stop 500 lands on 501 permille, which snaps back to 500, and the knob never moves again. Rounding in `stop_value` makes `stop_of(stop_value(i)) == i` for every count `with_stops` accepts; an exhaustive test over 2..=1001 pins it. `lib/controls/src/value.rs` |
| D429 | x86_64's `CR4.OSXSAVE` enable runs `or` inside an `asm!` block that declares `preserves_flags`, which the inline-assembly contract forbids | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge (the block predates it, `a00926b5f`); not absorbed. `or` writes OF, CF, SF, ZF and PF, so the compiler may keep a comparison's flags live across the block: undefined behaviour on the boot path of every x86_64 CPU with XSAVE. Dropping `preserves_flags` from that block alone is the fix; the `xsetbv` block's is correct. `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/xstate.rs` |
| D430 | WinterSun's settings sliders keep a private copy of the stops mapping that `lib/controls`' `Slider::with_stops`, `stop_value` and `stop_of` now provide | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `permille_of` and `position_of` are `stop_value` and `stop_of`, and `detented` imitates stops with `with_steps` and re-seats the knob on every sample; building the knobs `with_stops` deletes all three and fires Preview only when a detent is crossed. `userland/games/wintersun/app/src/settings.rs` |
| D431 | an SVG `data-outline-color` of zero alpha is accepted though it paints nothing, so an untrusted cursor set can declare an invisible rim the pipeline still strokes and composites | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. Only `none` and `currentColor` are refused; `#0000`, `#10203000` and `rgba(0,0,0,0)` pass, against the rustdoc, `docs/src/desktop/svg-assets.md` and `parse_fill`'s own rule. `lib/svg/src/document.rs` |
| D432 | `lib/raster`'s `box_blur_coverage` is public, and re-exported, with no caller outside the crate | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. Its one outside user moved to `soften_coverage`; it becomes `pub(crate)` and leaves the README. `lib/raster/src/{blur,lib}.rs` |
| D433 | x86_64 decodes the CPU vendor twice, and decides a security scrub by the vendor's display string | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `hybrid.rs` keeps its own `AuthenticAMD` constants and `is_amd_vendor` beside `cpuname`'s `vendor_from_leaf0`, which is now always built and documented as the one decode, and `xstate::keeps_x87_pointers` compares against `"Intel"`. It fails safe, since an unknown vendor is scrubbed, but a typed vendor removes the string coupling. `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/{hybrid,cpuname,xstate}.rs` |
| D434 | docs left stale by the pointer and slider work | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `lib/wallpaper/README.md`'s registry lacks the four `cursor.*` keys; `docs/src/desktop/theming.md`'s list of every logical length omits `slider_knob`; `lib/controls/src/value.rs`'s module doc still calls the knob a thumb; `lib/theme/README.md` claims one smoothstep for every animation, which D372 disproves; `Ring::thickness`'s rustdoc omits the clamp to `MAX_DRAWING_EXTENT` its fill applies |
| D435 | the new slider tests are weaker than their names, and two test files gained decorative banners | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `the_knob_is_the_themes_size…` bounds the knob only from above, `a_focused_knob_is_ringed_clear_of_itself…` never measures the gap, nothing drives `set_value` or `with_cap` with stops (D427), and `lib/controls/src/value_tests.rs` and `lib/svg/src/document_tests.rs` each add a `// ---` banner the charter forbids |
| D436 | resampling zero-fills its row cache and accumulator on every call, though both are written before they are read | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; performance, and the cost predates it. Resetting the held rows already rules out a stale row and the first tap writes the accumulator, so the fill is some 0.3–0.5 MB a frame at 4K for nothing. `lib/raster/src/resample.rs` (`resample_into`, `RowCache::reset`) |
| D437 | the cursor fitter's rule that keeps a stem from vanishing pushes each of a run of close edges one pixel past the last pushed one, so the drift accumulates without bound | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; latent, since no shipped cursor needs more than one push. `knots` pushes against the *pushed* `last_pixel`: in the committed fixture at a 16 px side an edge 3 px from the hotspot lands 5 px out and halves a bar, and one-unit stripes land edge *k* at *k*−1 px rather than *k*/2 px, running off the image, against its own rustdoc and `docs/src/desktop/cursors.md`. Bounding the push to one step, with a test that every knot lies within a pixel of its own nearest boundary, is the fix. `lib/cursor/src/fit.rs` |
| D438 | the cursor fitter cuts a pattern tile's content one nesting level earlier than the renderer, and restarts the tile's depth at zero | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. At `MAX_GROUP_DEPTH` `restated` drops a whole node list where the renderer still draws plain fills, so a pattern whose tile nests seven groups renders empty once fitted (and a clip at that depth masks its subtree away), while `Edges::collect` skips such fills' edges and `drawn_contours` still outlines them. `Fit::node` already keeps a too-deep group's place with no content; one tree map for both removes the divergence. `lib/cursor/src/fit.rs` |
| D439 | the cursor outline treats a contour whose signed area nets to zero as enclosing nothing, so a figure-eight body is drawn without its rim | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; latent, since the shipped-set rim test would refuse such an asset. `encloses` tests the shoelace sum, and the hourglass `M4 2 H20 L4 22 H20 Z` sums to exactly zero before and after fitting while the renderer fills both lobes; only an all-collinear contour is degenerate. `lib/cursor/src/raster.rs` |
| D440 | the cursor fitter's minimum-length test reads each segment alone, so an upright or level edge split by a vertex is never snapped, as every stroke's butt end now is | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; latent, since the shipped sets use filled shapes. The stroker's six-point segment, from the same merge, splits each end into two half-width pieces, so a two-unit stroke at a 24 px side leaves a half-covered row at each end. Merging consecutive collinear upright or level runs before the test is the fix. `lib/cursor/src/fit.rs` (`Edges::contour`), `lib/svg/src/stroke.rs` |
| D441 | `lib/cursor` restates logic `lib/raster` and its own fitter already hold | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `Edges::collect` is a copy of `tairix_raster::for_each_fill`'s walk; `outline_pixels` is `Span::pixels(width).max(1)`; `image.rs` rounds `a·b/c` three times over (`at_side`, `scaled`, `scaled_signed`); `CursorImage::row` re-implements `Surface::row_span` for its one caller |
| D442 | stale or false comments in `lib/cursor` | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `tests.rs`'s `NATIVE` says the reference side is the built-in design grid, which is 2048 units; `raster.rs` says offsets round half away from the anchor where `round_i32` rounds half up; `raster.rs` and `docs/src/desktop/cursors.md` say a built-in and a decoded cursor's grids differ, though both are 2048; the miter-limit note overstates which corners square off; `Cargo.toml` names neither `fallible` nor the built-in art's `round_i32` among `tairix-util`'s uses; `a_larger_pointer_casts_a_proportionally_larger_shadow` checks only larger |
| D443 | the pointer trail stops asking for frames by the clock rather than by what it drew, so its last ghost can stay on screen until the next input | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `Trail::next_frame_in` answers `None` once the clock passes the catch-up instant, but the frame drawn just before it still holds the oldest copy and the park reads a later clock, so with no other deadline armed the ghost stays, most visibly after a flick stops against a screen edge. The shake and the beacon owe a frame until they have drawn their rest state; the trail must too, with a test that draws just before catch-up and parks just after. `userland/gui/session/src/aids/trail.rs`, `aids.rs` |
| D444 | a Ctrl press that wakes the screensaver sets off the locate rings when it is released | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. The wake path drops only a *completed* tap: the press leaves the recogniser armed, the screensaver goes down at once, and the release, almost always a later wake, completes the tap, against `run.rs`'s own comment and `docs/src/desktop/session.md`. The wake must abandon a tap in progress too, with a test of press, abandon, release. `userland/gui/session/src/{run,keyboard}.rs` |
| D445 | the pointer aids render on every wake rather than once a frame, so a shake resamples the enlarged cursor at the pointer's sample rate | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; performance. `animate` steps the aids on every wake, the enlargement ramp's level changes on nearly every one, and `set_enlargement` skips only an identical permille, so a 1000 Hz mouse reinstalls the enlarged image some 160 times across a 160 ms ramp for about ten presented frames, and a running beacon's halo is erased and redrawn per wake, against the "once a frame" `aids.rs`, `docs/src/desktop/session.md` and `docs/src/desktop/cursors.md` state. Skipping an install whose pixel side is unchanged removes most of it; stepping the aids only on a frame the pacer admits removes the rest. `userland/gui/session/src/aids.rs`, `userland/gui/wm/src/select.rs` |
| D446 | Ctrl with the scroll wheel counts as a lone Ctrl, so releasing it shows the locate rings | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `Scrolled` stamps no gesture time where a button does, though the seat already treats a scroll as a deliberate gesture. `userland/gui/session/src/device.rs` |
| D447 | turning a pointer aid off while it runs leaves its last frame on screen | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `set_policy` resets or stops the aid and the loop then parks with nothing owed, so frozen rings, an enlarged pointer or ghosts stay until the next wake; the rest-state rule D443 needs closes it too. `userland/gui/session/src/aids.rs` |
| D448 | the pointer-aid merge left tidying undone in the window manager and the session | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `covering_sources` was inserted between `resolve_chrome`'s rustdoc and its body, so `resolve_chrome` lost its docs and `covering_sources` wears the wrong ones; `pointer.rs`'s `erase` hand-rolls `Surface::fill_rect`; `shake.rs`'s `Ramp` restates `tairix_theme::Fade` in permille; `beacon.rs` keeps its own millisecond constant; `wm/src/tests.rs` adds a decorative banner; `set_cursor_look`'s rustdoc omits its `shadow` parameter. `userland/gui/{wm,session}/src/` |
| D449 | a locate beacon's halo damage allocates per rectangle on the composite path | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; performance, bounded. The halo's slabs expand into up to a few hundred canonical damage rectangles, and each builds a fresh `covering_sources` vector and rebuilds the sprite list for the ~720 ms a beacon runs; the vector can be reused as `hits` already is. `userland/gui/wm/src/compositor.rs` |
| D450 | `Compositor::repaint_window` clones the caller's damage region on every call, an allocation per repaint for every embedder | noticed while scoping the ray-traced screensaver's repaint; not absorbed, because the fix changes the compositor API every embedder paints through. The clone exists only to clip the region to the window; a scratch region the compositor keeps, or a clip applied as the rectangles are walked, removes it. `userland/gui/wm/src/compositor.rs` |
| D452 | SplitMix64's output function is written out three times: `lib/rng`'s crate-internal `SplitMix64::next`, `lib/raytrace`'s `sample::mix64` and `terminal.app`'s `effects::splitmix` | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. One public `lib/rng` mixer that `SplitMix64` itself steps through serves all three with bit-identical output. `lib/rng/src/noncrypto.rs`, `lib/raytrace/src/sample.rs`, `userland/apps/terminal/src/effects.rs` |
| D453 | a process's scheduling level reaches only its leader thread: `sched_set_priority` re-weights the leader's task alone, and every new thread is admitted at `Normal` | **medium**; noticed while scoping the ray-traced screensaver's idle setting; not absorbed, because the fix needs its own concurrency design (section below). A lowered multi-threaded process keeps its workers at `Normal`, and a process lowered by its parent or under `CAP_PROC_CONTROL` escapes the demotion by creating threads. `kernel/core/src/{threads,syscalls}.rs` |
| D454 | the file manager reads a second window's first listing on its event loop | noticed while fitting the window to its listing; not absorbed. `first_listable` walks its fallback ladder (the named folder, then home, then the root view) synchronously, which is sound for the first window because none exists yet, but `open_more` runs it on the loop for every later one while other windows owe frames, so a slow or failing volume stalls them all. The fix is the ladder on the worker: open at the named folder over the deferred source and fall back when its listing is refused, the window fitted when the listing that stands lands. `userland/apps/files/src/run.rs` |
| D455 | the ABI spells "no timeout" four ways and the kernel converts a relative timeout to a deadline in eight places, though `waitq::deadline_for` is documented as the one definition every timed park shares | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed, because the fix changes syscall semantics. `WAITSET_TIMEOUT_NONE` and `LOCK_WAIT_FOREVER` are two ABI constants for the one `u64::MAX` spelling; `futex_wait` and `users_db_wait` name it only in prose, which leaves `lib/rt`'s `sync` and `lib/parallel`'s `pool` each a private copy; and `stream_read` means *indefinite* by `0`. `waitset_wait`, `irq_wait` (`kernel/irq`, which cannot reach `kernel/core`), the unlock service and five more sites saturate the add themselves, so a huge finite timeout silently becomes an indefinite wait where `deadline_for` clamps it to a real deadline. The fix is one `TIMEOUT_NONE` beside `Duration64` in `lib/abi`, `deadline_for` moved below every caller, `stream_read` given `0` = do not wait (auditing its 36 callers, each of which would otherwise start spinning), and the generated header regenerated. The drivers, the channels, the session and the greeter spell the waitset's form as `WAITSET_TIMEOUT_NONE` alone |
| D456 | the WinterSun figure engine carries its own 3-vector and rotation frame beside `lib/util`'s `space` | noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `figure/src/frame.rs`'s `Body` repeats `Vec3`'s dot, cross, length and a Rodrigues turn, and `Basis` repeats `Frame`'s apply (`to_world`), unapply (`to_local`) and compose (`rotated_by`) — 346 references across 26 files. Whether `Body` stays a distinct type (its named body axes keep a figure-frame offset from being mistaken for a world one) is a `plans/WINTERSUN.md` decision; either way the math is `space`'s, reached through a typed view rather than written a second time |
| D458 | a DMA master narrower than its grant is handed memory past its reach: the xHCI decode reads `HCCPARAMS1.AC64` but nothing narrows a carve by it, and `dma_alloc` takes no driver-stated limit | **medium**; noticed while bounding translated IOVAs; not absorbed, because the fix is a narrowing limit on the carve ABI (never wider than the grant) and its runtime and driver plumbing. Untranslated, a 32-bit controller on a machine with RAM above 4 GiB may be given a frame it cannot address; behind a translation unit the top-down IOVA makes it certain. `lib/usb/src/lib.rs`, `kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs` |
| D459 | the greeter presents up to four times a loop round, and paints the whole screen once per input event | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed, because the fix reworks how `LoginScreen` defers its paint against its scanout ring. `run.rs`'s pointer and keyboard drains each `show` (`:308`, `:344`) before the round presents its wake and `refresh` results (`:512`, `:528`), so a round with motion and a due ribbon frame makes two to four blocking presents; `on_input`/`on_pointer` (`screen.rs:286`, `:335`) paint inline for every event, so a key-repeat burst costs a full repaint each. Both break "drain, then paint once". The fix records each event's change, paints once after the drains, and presents the round's union once (the early show before `fade_out` kept), with a test that a burst paints and presents once |
| D460 | the greeter's smaller seams: one lockout slot, an unchecked chrome bound, the identity line spelled three ways, display power on the loop, a whole-screen ribbon present | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `wait.rs:36-60` keeps one lockout, so a second locked account drops the first's countdown though the greeter README and `NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` say returning to it finds it still counting (the authority still enforces it; no bypass). `MAX_CHROME = 96` (`lib/greeter/src/surface.rs:31`) is justified by the longest host name but neither derived from nor tested against `HOSTNAME_MAX` (64; the longest identity line is 91). The identity line is hand-spelled in `greeter/src/chrome.rs:73`, `login/src/view.rs:218` and `switchboard/src/resource_report/mod.rs:190`, so the graphical and text logins disagree. `switch_off`/`wake` make blocking `set_power` calls from the loop (`screen.rs:417`, `:440`), the desktop screensaver's shape too: a design question for `lib/display`. `compose_ribbon` merges its strips into one box (`screen.rs:650`), so each 30 Hz frame presents about the whole screen where a short rectangle list would do |
| D461 | `lib/display`'s sleep answers a refused blank as `Blanked` or `Refused` while leaving the display awake | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. With `can_blank == false` a refusal leaves the state `Awake` (`sleep.rs:89-95`) but returns variants documented as "kept black and still in its place", so the session logs "the screensaver is kept black instead" (`userland/gui/session/src/run.rs:2638`) with no screensaver shown; `sleep_tests.rs:119` asserts only `.is_some()`. A distinct `LeftAwake(DriverError)` answer, tested, fixes the record |
| D462 | three raytrace output defects: river meanders bent by points already moved, a sky hemisphere weighted toward the zenith, and distant grass leaning one way | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed, because each changes what the scenes look like. `land.rs:1656-1673 shape_river` moves `course[index]` in place and takes its normal from the moved `last` and the unmoved `next`; with sway up to ~36 m over ~4 m spacing the tangent tilts up to ~75° and the course can fold, and `travelled` is measured on moved points too: compute every offset from an untouched copy. `atmosphere.rs:301-311 hemisphere` weights texels by `sin e`, but rows pack `e = s²π/2` and each ring shrinks with `cos e`, so the weight is `sin e · cos e · s` and the zenith cap takes about three times its share of the ambient that lights the clouds. `grass.rs:1024`, `:1029` draw a far cell's shoot rounding and its first heading from one value, so the shoots that survive the rounding all head into one arc (suspected; a heading histogram confirms it). Each fix lands with its test: a straight course moved sideways by `sway`, the hemisphere integral of a uniform sky, the heading spread |
| D463 | numeric helpers written out again across `lib/raytrace`, `lib/terrain`, `lib/ribbon` and `lib/theme` | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. The `f64`→`f32` narrowing is defined five times in `lib/raytrace`, each with its own `#[allow]` (`land.rs:433`, `prototype.rs:85`, `cloud.rs:960`, `bvh.rs:92`, and `atmosphere.rs:128 stored`, which is `prototype::stored`), and again in `terrain/droplet.rs:274` and `ribbon/light.rs:1900`. Bilinear blending is re-done at `cloud.rs:945`, `:701`, `:755`, `shade.rs:140` and `terrain/droplet.rs:205` beside `heightfield::bilinear`; `cloud.rs:568 henyey_greenstein` is `sky.rs:224 scattering` and `cloud.rs:956 cell` is `heightfield.rs:692 count`; the `fade`/`lerp` closures repeat `noise.rs`; a share-to-byte rounding appears three times; `heightfield.rs:524 lowest_over` copies `highest_over`'s walk. `leaf.rs:74 power` is `terrain/incision.rs:144 power`, and the `exp(p·ln x)` idiom is inline four more times (a `mathf::powf`). `Vec3::luminance` has one consumer while the Rec. 709 weights repeat in `lib/theme/src/legibility.rs:33` and `radiosity.rs:227`; `grass.rs:1226` hand-rolls the rotation `Phasor` packages (it needs the cosine too); `compose/footprint.rs`'s `Index` and `compose/woodland.rs`'s `Crowns` are one chained grid twice; also `work.rs:177-194` and `:224-232` re-implement `band.rs:12-28`, `architecture.rs:694-697` is `landscape::stand`, `woodland.rs:841`'s angle wrap is `bark.rs:598`'s, `woodland.rs:1021-1024` is `landscape::square`, the `ground < sea + 0.2` wet rule is written at `land.rs:319` and `:381`, `bark.rs:563 mix` is `noise.rs:42 lerp`, `atmosphere.rs:98-112` and `:362-365` hand-roll bilinear blends, `cloud.rs:506-522 past_column` repeats `grass.rs:1365-1393`'s grid-wall walk, `compose/stones.rs:48` writes `rock::MOST_FRACTURES` as a literal, `land.rs:2314 pair` repeats `work.rs:106 apart` with a split that panics past the end, and `work.rs:16-24`'s rustdoc restates the `#[allow]` reason beneath it |
| D464 | raytrace composition units neither bounded nor parallel, and canopy grids padded up to 2.9× | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; performance. `compose.rs:203-268` builds every non-tree prototype in one unit on the calling thread (a 5120-facet rock and its whole BVH in one `step(usize::MAX)`, logs, stumps, palms, ferns, saguaros), against the module's promise that each unit is small enough for a caller answering a frame to stop after it; `woodland.rs:729` sorts every seedling (about eleven times `most`, a million ~80-byte entries for a 90 k-tree forest) in one unit; the last `FarSettle` unit blends the whole 1025² far grid's border single-threaded (`land.rs:1195-1201`). `compose.rs:946` rounds a canopy tier's side up to a power of two, so a meadow's ~1344- and ~1200-cell tiers become 2048-cell grids, ~34 MB each where ~14 MB would do, every padded vertex filled; also `shade.rs:65-114 Shades::of` walks every crown twice into two 513² grids and blurs them eight times in one single-threaded unit (`woodland.rs:965`) |
| D465 | raytrace per-sample work not hoisted | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; performance. `land.rs:1896` calls `band(0)` per far vertex and `:1930` recomputes `exp(0.8·ln …)` per call, both constant per grid, and `:1876` reads `horizon.height_at` for every far vertex, also where the blend is 1; `trace.rs:786` and `:1038` both evaluate `canopy.diffuse()` (eight `exp`) for one shading point; a leaf's outline profile is worked out three times a hit (`covers`, `prototype.rs:419 off_midrib`, `Foliage::colour`); `atmosphere.rs:733` recomputes `atan2(sun.z, sun.x)` per lookup; also, under `Dome::Air`, `trace.rs:548-556` traces a full sun transmittance ray for every eye hit before the in-scatter it serves is known to matter (medium: a further BVH walk per sample), `woodland.rs:260-263 Reading::tree` reads one height three times through `lie`, `wet_at` and `water`, `plants.rs:133-134` takes `ln` inside a sort comparator, `bark.rs:151-167` evaluates the bark pattern four times a hit, and `grass.rs:691-724 Lawn::canopy` re-derives the stand the walk already had |
| D466 | raytrace invariant tests cut from 24 seeds to 3, and new code untested | **medium**; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. This row is the issue the charter requires beside a weakened test: `compose_tests.rs:28 SEEDS = 3` (with `STILL_SEEDS = 12`) now runs `every_scene_is_lit_and_made_of_sound_parts`, `every_hull_lies_within_its_extent`, `the_camera_is_above_the_water` and `the_pieces_stand_in_the_frame` over 3 seeds a setting where they ran 24; the cheap checks belong on the composed `Stage` over 24 seeds, the built corpus kept for the costly ones. Untested: `heightfield`'s new API (`leave_out`/`present`, absent corners in `seal`/`patch`/`smooth_normal`, `attributes_at`/`attributes_of`, `lowest_over`); `terrain.rs`'s tilt, `rim: None`, `keep`/`pin` and the wandering clearing edge; `land_tests.rs:184` never asserts `kinds[1]`; the nest-border join, deltas, bridge decks and the horizon grid; `stones.rs`; the Valley vantage and `Aqueduct::site`; `Kind::Gorse` is missing from `plants_tests`' `KINDS`. A sculpture may stand in water or inside another piece (suspected: `landscape.rs:3245 sculpture_piece` claims without `stage.clear` or `wet_at`, `erg` likewise at `:2417`), to be asserted across `Setting::Sculpture` seeds; also the merge deleted `an_eye_stands_on_the_lowest_ground_in_sight`, `an_eye_with_nowhere_dry_to_stand_stays_above_the_water` and `an_eye_stands_its_rise_above_the_ground` without replacement and cut the exact-rise check to one seed; and `glare`/`sun_in_view`, `damp`, the coarse cloud march, `Instance` and `Lawn` in `every_bounded_shape_lies_within_its_box`, and the leaf budget's `MOST_PARTS` truncation have no test |
| D467 | `lib/terrain`'s smaller seams | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `route.rs begin` clears `cost`, `came` and `settled` over the whole grid per route though the search keeps to a box (a 512² realm, ~2.4 MB, per WinterSun road; a full-grid fill inside one raytrace step), against the module's cost proportional to distance; a per-search generation stamp bounds it. `narrow(usize) -> u32` is defined at `drainage.rs:48`, `route.rs:227` and as a closure at `grid.rs:38`, and saturates to the `u32::MAX` that also means "unreached" past 2³² samples: `Flood::new` and `Router::new` should refuse such an area and keep one helper. `NEIGHBOURS` restates `FlowDir::offset`/`length`, held together only by a test. `drainage.rs order_key` quantises to 1/4096, so a pit can fill up to a quantum high despite "no epsilon"; an IEEE total-order key is exact. `droplet.rs:85` squares an `i32` offset that overflows past radius 32767 (suspected; `new` should refuse a radius `run` cannot use). `hillslope::slump` and `Flood::order` have no consumer outside the crate's tests |
| D468 | the bcm2835 DMA driver's reset-reporting and withdrawn-channel edges | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed. `engine.rs stop` answers `Halted::Undrained` when only the `DEBUG` clear fails, which the ABI defines as writes cut off; `Controller::new`'s `engine.channel(channel)?` (`controller.rs:284`) returns `None` unrecorded, and `main.rs:177` then logs a refused reset; a withdrawn channel's level-triggered line stays in the wait set, so one held high wakes the loop for nothing (it needs a reset the bus refuses, which real hardware does not); `retire` stops twice and can record `Unreset` twice; `(owned, usable): (u64, u64)` are two swappable masks; with no window covering the registers the driver comes up and then refuses every Prepare instead of failing at bring-up |
| D469 | the ribbon tones its clear space before painting it over, a shadowed run warms its glyphs twice, and the starfield keeps its own clock | low; noticed reviewing a merge; not absorbed; performance. `lib/ribbon/src/light.rs:836-839 paint` tones every pixel of the clear space and then overwrites it with `SKY`, on every full repaint of the login column; with `draw_text_shadowed` removed, `lib/font/src/font.rs:664-676` makes two `with_client` passes per shadowed run; `userland/gui/session/src/saver/starfield.rs:189-193` hand-writes the bounded late-wake step `SceneClock` provides. A paint may also wait on the font service for an uncached glyph (suspected, desktop-wide: the login clock spells day and month names) |
| D471 | `waitset_create` is unbounded and has no destroy: each call inserts a set into the kernel's process-global registry, infallibly, and a set lives until its owner exits | **high, security**; noticed bounding the sandbox's reply wait; not absorbed, because the fix is a kernel resource-limit design of its own. An unprivileged process looping the call grows kernel memory without limit, and the infallible map insert aborts the kernel when the heap refuses. Wants a per-process bound under the resource-limit facility, a fallible insert that fails closed, and a destroy the runtime's wait-set handle calls on drop. `kernel/core/src/waitset.rs`, `kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs` |
| D472 | the sandbox's one-shot request write has no deadline: a worker that answers without reading can leave its request pipe full, and the caller's next write then blocks for ever, stalling every later decode queued on that worker | **medium**; noticed adding the reply deadline; not absorbed, because the bound needs a timed stream write (`STREAM_WRITE` taking a deadline as `STREAM_READ` does) or a writability wait the one-shot channel can arm without minting a wait-set per worker (D471). `lib/sandbox/src/rt.rs`, `lib/rt/src/io.rs` |
| D473 | an asynchronous clipboard put is refused once the keyboard moves on: the session takes a put only from the window that holds the keyboard, and Paint's copy is encoded on a worker, so one that lands after the user has clicked elsewhere is refused (and said); one whose window closed goes through another of its windows only if that one has the keyboard | **medium**; noticed fixing a copy lost with its window; not absorbed, because the fix is a clipboard protocol change: a claim made at the copy gesture under the keyboard rule, fulfilled later under the claim, as X11 selections, Wayland data sources and RISC OS's claim-entity do. `lib/abi/src/window_ipc.rs`, `userland/gui/session/src/windows.rs`, `userland/apps/paint/src/run.rs` |
| D474 | the ext4 driver carries its own CRC-32C beside `lib/crc32c`, the algorithm's one definition | noticed checking `lib/crc32`'s consumers; not absorbed, because `lib/crc32c` answers only a whole buffer, initialised and inverted, while `metadata_csum` continues a raw register from a seed with no final inversion. The fix is a continuation entry in `lib/crc32c` that its dispatched implementations serve (the CRC instructions already take the running value), which the driver then calls; its integration test keeps its own copy, deliberately, as the independent reference. `drivers/filesystem/ext4/src/lib.rs`, `lib/crc32c/src/lib.rs` |
| D475 | 36 manifest and source comments call `Errno` "the frozen `Errno`", though `abi-v1` is not frozen until the first release | noticed writing Paint's manifest, whose own line now says `abi-v1`; not absorbed, because the rest is a wording sweep across thirty-odd unrelated bundles. `grep -rn 'frozen `Errno`'` lists them |
| D476 | Paint's shape coverage is a second scan converter beside `lib/raster`'s: a brush, line or ellipse edge pixel is sampled sixteen times rather than answered by the exact-area converter every other surface fills through | **medium**; noticed reviewing Paint's shapes; not absorbed, because moving onto `lib/raster` extends its interface: Paint needs a hard-edged mode, a pixel covered by whether its centre is inside, for pictures that hold no partial coverage, and the converter's per-row coverage exposed rather than only its fills. Which interface `lib/raster` grows is its owner's decision. `userland/apps/paint/src/shape.rs`, `lib/raster/src/` |
| D479 | the bcm2835 DMA driver trusts an unconfirmed reset: `stop` takes the write's `Ok` as the channel idle and `release` frees its chain, and `halt` discards what `settle` answers, so a channel that ignored the reset keeps fetching freed control blocks on a machine with no translation unit; the window split (`covers_registers`) has no host test | **medium, security**; noticed reviewing the IOMMU merge, beside D468; not absorbed with DMA work waiting on the IOMMU plan. A bounded read-back (`CONBLK_AD` zero, `CS.ACTIVE` clear) failing closed to `DeviceFault`, `halt` answering its result, and the split moved into the host-tested lib. `drivers/dma/bcm2835/src/{engine,controller,main}.rs` |
| D483 | `lib/terrain`'s talus gathers without bound: a sample's shed is capped at half its steepest excess, but nothing caps what a pit receives, so a pit fed from eight sides overshoots them all — a 3×3 pit of 0 ringed by 10 ends one pass at 35.2 against a ring of 5.5 — and the rustdoc's "no sample is lowered past a neighbour it sheds onto" is false; the banded `slump_measure`/`slump_settle` split the raytracer runs has no test | **medium**; noticed reviewing the raytrace and terrain merge; logged rather than absorbed, by the user's decision for this merge. Bound each pair's transfer (e.g. `rate·excess/8`) so eight donors cannot lift a pit past them, restate the rustdoc, and test a single pit and banded-equals-whole. `lib/terrain/src/hillslope.rs` |
| D484 | `lib/terrain`'s grid arithmetic and search seams: `Grid::area` and `index` multiply unchecked in `usize`, so on a 32-bit target a side of 65 536 aborts inside `fits` before any `OutOfMemory` refusal, which D467's later refusal cannot help; no route test exercises the search box; and every relaxation re-derives by division the coordinates `neighbour` just computed, and the goal's | low; noticed reviewing the raytrace and terrain merge; logged rather than absorbed, by the user's decision for this merge. A fallible `Grid::new` checking that side² fits `usize` and `u32`, a confined-box test, coordinates carried through the search. `lib/terrain/src/{grid,route,droplet}.rs` |
| D485 | the merge's smaller seams outside the raytracer: `SceneClock::moved` and `seconds` are public with only test callers; WinterSun's hydrology defines sea level a second time (`SEA`) beside `Elevation::SEA_LEVEL`, and its `DIFFUSION` comment puts the stability bound at a quarter where `hillslope` documents one; `sites.rs` still narrates the A* search `tairix_terrain::route` now owns, re-derives `Grid::neighbour` and `drainage::downstream`, and its `solve` does not document the `Mismatch` it can return; the session page's and the settings plan's account of preparation (a band of rows per slice) is stale against `prepare`'s deadline-bounded units; the greeter's `EXIT_NO_DISPLAY` message cannot say whether the mode or the allocator refused; and `lib/util::space::aligning` half-turns about an arbitrary perpendicular for bends between 120° and 180°, so a frame carried along a branch can flip | low; noticed reviewing the raytrace and terrain merge; logged rather than absorbed, by the user's decision for this merge. `lib/theme/src/motion.rs`, `userland/games/wintersun/world/src/{hydrology,sites}.rs`, `docs/src/desktop/session.md`, `plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md`, `userland/gui/session/src/saver/raytrace/engine.rs`, `userland/session/greeter/src/run.rs`, `lib/util/src/space.rs` |
| D486 | raytrace composition defects: a canopy fill clones the lawn's shade grid infallibly (`compose.rs:951-957`, about 0.9 MB at tier 2), so memory pressure aborts the session where the crate promises `None`; nothing keeps trees or stones off a bridge's deck (`bridges` claims nothing, and the road attribute is withheld where the deck spans) or out of an aqueduct's bays, so a willow can stand through the deck; a narrow diagonal river loses its water surface in dashes, because the fresh-water grid fills only within half its width and a far step (`land.rs:2088-2097`); woods with no sward build no shade grid, so a plaza's thousands of trees neither roof the air nor drop litter; and the README's "a setting, a seed and an aspect compose one scene" no longer holds, since the sowing reach depends on resolution | **medium**; noticed reviewing the raytrace and terrain merge; logged rather than absorbed, by the user's decision for this merge. `lib/raytrace/src/{compose.rs,compose/landscape.rs,compose/architecture.rs,compose/woodland.rs,land.rs}`, `lib/raytrace/README.md` |
| D487 | raytrace render defects: the coarse cloud march charges a clear column's jump to its step budget, so a low coarse ray across a broken deck stops part-way, and the horizon's cloud drops out of indirect light and wet-ground reflections while the eye still sees it (`cloud.rs:445-465`); radiosity reuses a record across 30° of turn where its doc says fifteen (`radiosity.rs:53-55`); a limb's taper and form are never applied (`tree.rs:817-823`), so every twig ends at 4 % of its girth; an instance hit returns girth and bark `uv` in prototype units, so a scaled tree wears bark at the wrong size (`shape.rs:387-393`); `Spot::ground`'s doc says nought off the land where the tracer fills `PLAIN`; and the bark's angle reference switches axis as a limb nears horizontal, leaving a ring seam (`prototype.rs:380-385`) | **medium**; noticed reviewing the raytrace and terrain merge; logged rather than absorbed, by the user's decision for this merge. `lib/raytrace/src/{cloud,radiosity,tree,shape,pigment,prototype}.rs` |

### D453 — a process's scheduling level reaches only its leader thread

`SchedPriority` is documented as a process's time-shared service level, but
the kernel applies it to one task: `sched_set_priority` calls `set_priority`
on the target's leader `TaskId` alone, and `threads::create` admits every
thread at `Priority::Normal`. So the Switchboard's *Lower* barely touches a
program whose work runs on a pool; a demotion meant to contain a tenant fails
open the moment it creates a thread; and the level reported for a process (its
leader's) need not be the one most of its threads run at.

The fix makes the level the thread group's: the change re-weights every thread
of `CapTable::threads_of(process)` and records the level for the group, and a
new thread is admitted at the recorded level. The two race: a thread created
while the level changes must not keep the old one, so the level is read and
the thread registered under the lock the change takes, and the thread's weight
is set before it is unparked. The ordering wants a loom model beside the host
tests.

Regression tests the fix carries: every existing thread of a lowered group
reports the lowered level; a thread created afterwards is admitted at it; a
thread created concurrently with a change ends at the changed level; a raise
still needs `CAP_PROC_CONTROL`; the process record reports the group's level.

### D140 — the loaded notification-icon set is never installed

`lib/icon`'s `IconSet` is the desktop's *tintable chrome glyph* tier: the
taskbar's notification area resolves each `StatusKind` through
`TaskbarRenderer::icons()`, and `set_icons` swaps a loaded set in, bumping the
generation that is part of the glyph cache's epoch. `DesktopSession::load_icons`
assembles that set from `/System/Graphics/Icons/<asset-id>.svg`. Both halves are
complete and unit-tested — and **neither is called from the session's bring-up**,
so the desktop always draws its built-in chrome glyphs. (This is the icon
counterpart of the cursor-load gap DS3b closed; noticed while closing that one.)

It is **latent**, not visible: the only kinds `draw_icon` resolves are
`Network`, `Volume` and `Battery`, and none of the three ships an SVG today, so
installing the set would change no pixel. It becomes a real defect the moment
any chrome kind ships artwork.

**Why it is not a two-line wiring fix.** `load_icon_set` reads one path per
`IconKind` — 80 of them — of which 78 would miss. Calling it at bring-up
would add 80 speculative VFS lookups to every boot to enable nothing. The
honest shape is the one the cursor and wallpaper stores already use: list
`/System/Graphics/Icons` **once**, keep the names `artwork_kind_for_file`
resolves to a kind with a `.svg` extension, and read only those. That is a
signature change to `load_icon_set` (it needs the present kinds, since the
`SessionFileReader` seam only reads a path) plus the bring-up call.

| D114 | `mem_unmap` refused every release a shrinking heap arena asked for, so the switchboard spent whole frames re-asking |
| D115 | the Switchboard memory composition read "unknown" under load, because it was built from a count of *mappings* rather than of RAM |
| D116 | a duplex storage or network trace tinted both directions alike, and the storage rail plotted only reads |
| D117 | a wait-queue test asserted a clear reading of process-global deferred-wake flags its siblings set |
| D119 | a wired path-backed descriptor was refused to a child holding no `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, breaking the inherited-document hand-off |
| D120 | a per-CPU guarded-copy republish was refused, halting every aarch64 secondary |
| D121 | `ContextSwitch::prepare` took the task's stack as a bare integer, so no UB oracle could interpret the three paging ports |
| D124 | the kthread resume handle round-tripped a control-block pointer through a `usize`, stripping its provenance |
| D125 | a host test identified a function by its address, which the language leaves unspecified |
| D126 | the kernel heap allocator threaded its free list and slab pages through integers, so no UB oracle could look at it |
| D128 | the panic backtrace's stack reader rebuilt a pointer from an integer address, so the unwinder could not be interpreted — and only ever vouched for the boot stack, so a kthread panic carried no frame chain |
| D129 | the `SleepLock` releaser deleted a live waiter's re-registered row, stranding it on a free lock |
| D130 | a thread killed while parked left its row in every wait queue, where a counted wake spent itself on it |
| D137 | the blocking `wait` registered the calling thread's *process* on the wait queue and parked the *thread*, so a non-leader reaper slept for the rest of the boot |
| D138 | `desktop-pressure-qemu-aarch64` photographed its artwork baseline on the desktop's reveal, which orders against neither the bar seating a slot nor that slot's artwork landing |
| D146 | a CPU fault in a minimal QEMU integration kernel was a silent hang |
| D147 | host tests hand-picked the task ids they keyed process-global registry state on, so a sibling test's `exit` scrubbed it by that id mid-assert |
| D148 | the hover gate's damage bound was exhausted by a desktop that re-damaged its whole icon bar after every published frame |
| D149 | icon artwork landing repainted the whole icon bar and the whole library popup, where only the slots and rows that gained a picture changed |
| D150 | boot stack had no overrun detector on any port |
| D151 | every in-tree fuzz harness drew its structural choices from an unmixed LCG's low bits, where bit *k* has period 2^(k+1) |
| D156 | `cap_delegate` let any task narrow any other task's capabilities by naming its pid |
| D157 | socket clients authenticated the stack's deliveries by pinning whichever sender posted first |
| D158 | `timed`, `ping`, and `telnet` bound fixed well-known delivery port ids any process could squat first |
| D159 | the mDNS engine charged the shared per-interface reply budget before the per-peer one |
| D160 | a sandbox session's parent allocated each worker-declared frame infallibly |
| D161 | userland drew keys, nonces, sequence numbers, ports, and ids through `random_get` and carried on with zeros when it was refused |
| D162 | the kernel never seeded its CSPRNG on a port whose hardware RNG is declared `Pending`, though the boot seed it had captured could have |
| D163 | `netstack` exited on every start-up failure without stating why |
| D165 | the SVG decoder admitted a pattern tile magnified past what the renderer can size, which the renderer then refused to draw at all |
| D167 | a dead driver's DMA memory was freed while its device could still master it |
| D173 | a DMA carve under an addressing limit took whichever block the free lists offered first, and refused it when that block lay above the limit |
| D174 | adjacent usable boot-map regions were populated as separate runs, so the buddies at their seam never merged |
| D176 | the userland runtime and its C stubs were outside the UB oracle, and three findings kept them there |
| D177 | the I²C controller driver wrote its bind records to a log it had no authority to reach, so every one was refused |
| D178 | a DMA window whose bus side starts at address 0 read as an untranslated limit, so its carves were named by their CPU address |
| D179 | a store answer adopted mid-drag snapped the terminal's settings sheet back under the pointer |
| D180 | the three trap-path callback slots were copied into every port's `fault.rs`; they are one `tairix_arch_api::fault` module — the fatal handler, now a `fn(KernelFault) -> !`, and the user-fault resolver and terminator — which every port's trap path, the kernel's bridge and user-fault wiring, and the verticals name (`each_slot_is_claimed_once_and_reads_back_what_was_installed`) |
| D181 | the boot-stack guard read a stack pointer on another stack as an overrun; the post-mortem judges one on the stack published for the running task on the canary alone, a fault is judged from the stack its code ran on (`fault_sp`) and a user-mode fault from none, and a port's prose names the limit for a stack no registry names (`a_stack_pointer_on_the_running_kthread_stack_is_no_boot_stack_overrun`, `a_fault_is_judged_from_the_stack_its_code_ran_on`) |
| D182 | the QEMU runner re-counted every unsatisfied readiness marker over the whole transcript on each 4 KiB read, quadratic in the transcript on the failure path; each marker now resumes past its last match and no earlier than a match could still begin (`MarkerProgress`), which reproduces the whole-log count exactly, pinned by `a_marker_counted_a_read_at_a_time_matches_the_whole_logs_count` and `a_pass_that_finds_nothing_resumes_at_the_logs_end` |
| D183 | `netstack` never released a dead principal's sockets, so a crashed process held its ports, groups, and connections for the rest of the boot; fixed on the kernel's `peer_watch` exit feed, pinned by `an_exited_principals_sockets_are_reclaimed_and_its_port_is_free_again` |
| D184 | a multicast group or bound datagram port taken before an interface existed, or before a bond was composed, never reached it, and a released bond member's group counts diverged from what sockets held; pinned by `a_membership_taken_before_an_interface_existed_reaches_it_and_its_socket_is_told`, `a_bond_composed_after_a_socket_joined_carries_its_group_and_its_bound_port`, and `a_released_member_holds_exactly_the_groups_sockets_hold_when_it_leaves` |
| D185 | an enrolled bond member's own engine held the service loop's park deadline, so the loop woke for timers nothing would service, and a bond's second member never had its device filter programmed; pinned by `an_enrolled_members_own_engine_never_holds_the_park_deadline` and `every_member_of_a_bond_has_its_own_device_filter_programmed` |
| D186 | `netstack` held one port space for both address families, so an IPv4 and an IPv6 socket could never share a port and a dual-family service lost one family — `discoveryd`'s IPv6 socket could not bind 5353 beside its IPv4 one, silently; each family now has its own space, pinned by `each_family_has_its_own_port_space` |
| D187 | PID 1 checked a service's conditions only to admit it: a provided condition stayed satisfied after its provider stopped being ready, so what required it ran on against a stack that had gone, and a stop of a service still waiting for admission was not honoured; a condition now holds only while a ready provider or an assertion does, its withdrawal stops what requires it and holds it for re-admission, and a stop is final, pinned by `a_provider_that_fails_withdraws_its_condition_and_holds_what_requires_it` and `stopping_a_service_still_waiting_for_its_condition_cancels_its_admission` |
| D188 | the startup description silently dropped options: a `session` accepted unit options it never honoured, and a repeated option replaced the first; both now refuse the config, pinned by `a_session_carries_no_unit_option` and `a_malformed_or_repeated_option_refuses_the_whole_config` |
| D189 | x86_64's per-CPU descriptor table routed no exception: `percpu::init` rebuilt all 256 vectors on the silent default thunk, so any fault after it parked the CPU with nothing said, and D146 held only until then; the boot and per-CPU tables now share one builder (`fatal_table`), pinned by `tairix-test-fatal-fault-percpu-qemu-x86_64` |
| D190 | x86_64's boot descriptor tables were a global mutable static (`UnsafeCell` behind a hand-written `Sync`) carrying about 20 KiB in `.data`; `linker.ld` now reserves them beside the boot stack, sized by the `boot_tables_bytes` symbol the port defines from the type, and the trampoline hands them to the entry, exercised by every x86_64 vertical |
| D191 | a syscall copy into or out of a page the caller maps uncached, device, or write-combined went through the cacheable direct map, whose dirty lines a non-coherent DMA master never sees and whose eviction overwrites what it wrote; the copy now refuses the page, pinned by `a_page_mapped_uncached_is_never_copied_through_the_cacheable_alias` |
| D192 | a DMA controller's windows were composed from its own bus alone: an empty `dma-ranges` read as unconstrained whatever the buses above said, and a window's end was never clipped to them; every bus is now composed in (`tairix_fdt::dma_reach`), pinned by `an_inner_window_is_clipped_to_the_outer_one_and_rebased_through_it` and `a_controller_below_an_identity_bus_reaches_memory_through_the_soc_above_it` |
| D193 | a translated DMA window covered a child with its bus base but another CPU start, a translation that re-points the device outside its carve; coverage now demands containment and the identical offset, pinned by `a_translated_dma_window_covers_only_a_sub_window_with_its_own_offset` |
| D194 | a shared-region map installed its entries before taking its reference, so a concurrent last unmap freed frames still mapped, and an unmap freed them before withdrawing them from the snapshot the copy path reads; the reference now comes first and is held until the teardown is published, pinned by `a_last_unmap_racing_a_map_cannot_free_the_frames_under_it` and `an_unmapped_region_is_freed_only_when_its_reference_goes` |
| D195 | the shared-region registry allocated infallibly on syscall paths (`create_dma`'s chunk list, the chunk copies, the map inserts), so a full kernel heap aborted a syscall; every allocation is now fallible and unwinds through the cleanup the map-failure tests cover — no host test can fail the heap itself |
| D196 | the desktop's idle lock failed open: a lock that could not engage was marked done and never asked for again, so the screen stayed open until the user returned; it is retried on a paced one-shot, pinned by `a_refused_lock_is_asked_for_again_on_a_paced_retry_never_at_once` |
| D197 | the idle lock could be held off: idle deadlines were served only on a wake that timed out, so a client keeping the loop busy postponed them indefinitely, and a key repeat the session made up counted as input, so a stuck key did too; both are closed in the serve loop (`is_due` pinned by `is_due_says_what_due_would_take_without_taking_it`; the loop wiring itself has no host test) |
| D198 | the idle lock came up over the screensaver, because the restack keeping the saver on top ran only on a non-idle wake; the idle path now restacks too (loop wiring, no host test) |
| D199 | a USB keyboard that went away left its held keys down, so the session repeated one for ever; the driver releases every key it last reported held before it exits (`tairix_hid::release_held`), pinned by `a_keyboard_leaving_releases_every_key_it_last_reported_held` and `a_release_delivers_what_was_latched_before_it` |
| D133 | a grantor could grow a recipient's pending-delegation table without bound, and the desktop session left every document it could not hand on pending for its life; a grantor may now have at most `FD_DELEGATIONS_PENDING_PER_GRANTOR` (64) pending to one recipient, refused past it as `LimitExceeded`, its delegations end with it, and the session declines a document nothing took, pinned by `a_grantor_is_refused_past_its_pending_bound_to_a_recipient`, `a_grantors_pending_delegations_end_with_it` and `a_hand_over_relays_a_document_to_the_resident_instance_or_delegates_nothing` |
| D200 | a served caller, and a grant's endpoint server, were resolved by their reusable pid, so a mint could land on, and a seat or grant query answer about, a successor admitted under that number; every such path now resolves the process instance — `shm_grant_peer`, `shm_grant` and `call_grant` mint under the capability table's read lock to the instance the call or endpoint recorded (`CallEndpoint::owner_instance`), and `call_peer_seat`, `call_peer_holds` and `call_peer_node` read under the same lock — pinned by `shm_grant_peer_mints_to_the_caller_being_served_while_it_lives`, `shm_grant_delegates_only_a_held_region_to_the_endpoints_server`, `call_grant_delegates_only_a_held_endpoint_to_the_recipients_server`, `call_peer_seat_reports_the_live_lease_of_the_in_service_peer` and `call_peer_holds_answers_a_controller_only_about_its_lines_and_windows` |
| D201 | `call_peer_holds` answered any endpoint server about any resource kind its caller held, so a server could probe the authority of whoever called it; it now answers only the holder of the endpoint's `DmaController` duty, and only about a request line naming that endpoint or an MMIO window (`OutOfRange` otherwise), pinned by `call_peer_holds_answers_a_controller_only_about_its_lines_and_windows` |
| D207 | the served-caller gate was copied into seven handlers and `shm_create_dma` repeated `dma_alloc`'s carve checks; both are now one definition each (`served_endpoint`, `dma_carve_terms`), and every peer query and delegated mint reaches its instance's state under one rule (`for_instance`) |
| D208 | aarch64's fatal record reported a fault address and syndrome the CPU never gave; `KernelFault`'s syndrome and address are optional and recorded `null` when absent. aarch64 reads `ESR_EL1` only for a synchronous or SError entry (`has_syndrome`) and `FAR_EL1` only where `far_is_valid`, once at entry, takes the PC from the frame, and offers the access-flag path and the resolver only a valid address; riscv64 names `stval` only for an address cause and reads it once, before anything that can take a nested trap rewrites it, and x86_64 no address outside `#PF` (`only_a_synchronous_or_serror_entry_carries_a_syndrome`, `an_abort_with_fnv_set_names_no_address`, `a_fault_with_no_address_records_none_and_probes_nothing`, `far_is_read_once_before_anything_can_take_a_nested_exception`, `the_fault_path_reads_stval_once_before_anything_can_trap`) |
| D209 | the ports' own fatal reports could re-enter without bound, and so could the post-mortem through its display reclaim and nested record, and the kernel binary's bridge through the console flush it ran before any latch; every report path takes an entry from the one `tairix_arch_api::fatal` latch first — one full report, one bare record, then silence — every console drain runs behind it through `KernelArch::flush_console_blocking`, a nested entry draining its bare record once written, and aarch64 enters it without atomics while stage-1 translation is off (`the_latch_grants_one_report_then_one_nested_record_then_silence`, `a_third_entry_halts_silently`, `a_fault_inside_the_console_drain_ends_in_the_nested_record`) |
| D210 | the fault reports disagreed across ports in what they read and when: aarch64 flushes the lock-guarded console only with translation on and seeds `TPIDR_EL1` at entry, so `cpu=` is always the dense id and a port that cannot name one says `hart=` or `apic_id=`; every report judges the guard from the faulting code's stack pointer, x86_64's being the `RSP` the CPU pushed; the kernel's pre-init window falls back to the port's own reports; x86_64 brings COM1 up once instead of re-initialising a live line; and a broken boot invariant — `refuse()`, a syscall before the dispatcher — is reported and parks on every port instead of leaving through QEMU's debug port or halting silently (`an_unmapped_processor_is_named_by_its_hardware_identity`, the fatal verticals' records) |
| D212 | the x86_64 boot and per-CPU tables' contents were untested, and the validator whose rustdoc said it ran before `lidt` never did; `fatal_table` builds over injected entries and is host-tested under both IST mappings, and `load` refuses a table `Idt::validate` rejects (`a_fatal_table_routes_every_vector_as_its_mapping_says`, `every_exception_vector_is_routed_once`, `a_malformed_table_is_refused_before_it_is_loaded`) |
| D269 | a kill removed a parked victim's task before its teardown withdrew the records keyed by its number, and the zombie-leader hold was returned at the group's last retire, before the process teardown ran, so the number could be drawn while a capability record, address space, grants and endpoints still named it; every user thread's id is now held from admission (`reserve_task_id`, fallible, so a refused hold refuses the spawn) to its teardown's last step — a non-leader's by `retire`, the leader's by the process teardown, and never on the driver-store unload's incomplete immediate path (D271) — pinned by `an_unloaded_drivers_number_stays_out_of_the_draw`, `an_admitted_childs_number_is_held_until_its_teardown_withdraws_its_records`, `no_retire_returns_the_leaders_id`, `a_siblings_retire_returns_its_own_id` and `a_held_id_is_refused_until_it_is_released` |
| D270 | seat leases and wait-sets were keyed by the calling thread while the process teardown released them by process, so one a worker thread took outlived its process and passed to whichever task drew that thread's id, with the seat's display and keyboard input; and a worker could neither watch its own process's endpoint or port nor share a lease with its siblings. Both are now the process's, pinned by `a_seat_lease_belongs_to_the_acquiring_threads_process` and `a_wait_set_belongs_to_the_creating_threads_process` |
| D274 | a delegation's redemption was not bound to the process that minted it, so the desktop session, redeeming whatever grant a `HandOverLaunch` named, could be made to consume a delegation another application had minted to it — the recipient's handles are dealt in sequence, so the next was predictable — and hand that application's document to the caller's own instance, or destroy it; the session now redeems through `fd_redeem_from`, bound to the attested caller carried on `LaunchTarget::Document`, and a handle the named instance did not mint answers `NotFound` and stays pending — pinned by `a_bound_redemption_takes_only_the_named_grantors_delegation`, `a_held_delegation_is_handed_on_without_widening_it` and `a_hand_over_relays_a_document_to_the_resident_instance_or_delegates_nothing` |
| D275 | a process's number returned to the draw before its death's trailing steps — a node release and the exit record, both keyed by it — and while its parent's unreaped row still stood, so a successor drawn at it could lose its node claim, be reported exited, or have its row overwritten; the number is now returned last (`retire_number`), after the exit is recorded, and a zombie's row holds it until the reap or the parent's death drops the row — pinned by `a_zombie_holds_its_number_until_its_row_is_gone`, `an_admitted_childs_number_is_held_until_its_teardown_withdraws_its_records`, `an_exit_reports_whether_a_reap_is_owed` and `parent_exited_drops_unreaped_zombies` |
| D276 | the held-id set hashed task ids under a predictable key, although which ids are held is shaped by what an unprivileged user spawns and keeps, so one could pile its threads into one bucket of a table probed while the scheduler holds its task table; it is now keyed under the per-boot hash key, falling back to unkeyed only on a boot that never got one, as the futex table does |
| D277 | `fd_grant` resolved its recipient's instance and minted into that number's table under separate holds, so a mint could land in a successor's table, unredeemable yet charged to the grantor; it now resolves and mints under one hold (`for_instance`), as every other delegated mint does |
| D171 | a dead address space was torn down with one TLB invalidation per page, broadcast on aarch64; a space its `ActiveCpus` shows active nowhere is now cleared with no invalidation at all (`AddressSpace::clear_lowest`), since every CPU that ran it discarded its translations when it switched away — pinned by `a_space_active_nowhere_is_torn_down_without_a_single_flush` and `a_space_still_active_elsewhere_is_shot_down_before_its_frames_go_back` |
| D234 | a user-space unmap on x86_64 or riscv64 invalidated only the calling CPU, so a sibling thread elsewhere kept a translation to the freed frame; every path that releases a user frame now clears its entries, shoots down the CPUs the space is active on (`ActiveCpus`, kept by the dispatcher, through `CrossCpuTlbShootdown::shootdown_user_range`), and only then zeroes and frees it — pinned by the `live::tests::views` and `retire::tests` suites and `a_user_task_holds_its_cpu_in_its_spaces_set_from_before_its_root_loads_until_it_parks`. See the section |
| D278 | every user release — `mem_unmap`, `dma_free`, `file_unmap`, a thread stack's release, direct reclaim — freed its frames before dropping them from the copy path's snapshot, so on aarch64 SMP a sibling thread's `read(2)` into the region could write a frame already handed to another process; the pages now leave the snapshot inside the release, before any frame goes (`SnapshotRetire`), and a snapshot that cannot take the removal is suspended until re-frozen — pinned by `an_unmapped_anonymous_frame_is_freed_only_after_every_view_lets_go`, `a_file_region_frame_is_freed_only_after_every_view_lets_go`, `a_dma_buffer_is_scrubbed_and_freed_only_after_every_view_lets_go` and `a_snapshot_that_cannot_drop_a_retired_page_resolves_nothing_until_replaced` |
| D279 | compress-out sealed a cold page while it was still mapped and in the snapshot, so a sibling thread's write between the seal and the unmap was lost when the stale copy was restored — and the tier's `&mut` over a page another CPU could write was a data race, its concurrency contract predating threads; the page now leaves every view before it is read, and a refused seal maps it back and restores it to the snapshot — pinned by `a_write_that_lands_as_the_page_leaves_its_views_is_sealed_with_it` and `an_incompressible_page_is_put_back_exactly_where_it_was` |
| D280 | a DMA carve was mapped before it was scrubbed, so a sibling thread could read the block's previous owner's bytes through the fresh mapping; its free scrubbed it while still mapped, and an undone carve was freed without a second scrub; a carve is now scrubbed before it is mapped, and freed or undone only after its entries are gone on every CPU and in the snapshot — pinned by `a_dma_buffer_is_scrubbed_and_freed_only_after_every_view_lets_go` and `a_carve_is_scrubbed_before_any_page_of_it_is_mapped` |
| D281 | riscv64's remote fence dropped a refused SBI call, skipped the fence outright for a range it could not express, and called the firmware once per hart; the harts now fold into one call per 64-hart window (`hart_windows`), a refusal or an unrepresentable range becomes a whole-space fence of every hart, and a secondary hart is not started on firmware without RFENCE — pinned by the `sbi::tests` window tests |
| D282 | a riscv64 hart that walked a page before another hart mapped it could re-fault on its cached absence indefinitely, because a fault that found its page already resident returned without a fence; the fault path now discards the faulting CPU's stale entry on that race — pinned by `a_fault_on_a_page_another_cpu_mapped_discards_the_stale_entry_here` |
| D283 | a sparse release cost time proportional to its whole range rather than to its resident pages: the unmap translated every page and the snapshot retirement walked every page of each batch's span; the release now visits only the space's live pages (`AddressSpace::next_live`) and retires each resident run, not the span — pinned by `a_sparse_release_visits_and_retires_only_its_resident_pages` |
| D285 | the charter-citation strip's residue survived where a stripped citation had ended its line: a parenthesis left open there, opening on its gloss's dash (`needs (` / `— no bloat).`) or holding nothing but the title of the section it named (`Arch HAL (` / `"TLB shootdown").`), in fourteen comments D236's forms could not see, since `charter-cite` joins a paragraph's lines with a space; each now reads as prose, a restated rule dropped, and the check refuses both forms — pinned by `a_parenthesis_a_stripped_citation_left_open_at_a_line_end_is_refused` and `a_parenthetical_whose_citation_was_stripped_is_refused` |
| D213 | the session defined the Settings bundle identifier beside `tairix_taskbar::system::SETTINGS_BUNDLE`; its copy is gone and every consumer takes the taskbar's, still checked against the Settings manifest by `the_settings_bundle_is_the_one_its_manifest_declares` |
| D215 | `activate_for_test`'s rustdoc sat inside `choose_for_test`'s, leaving one helper both texts and the other none; each now carries its own |
| D218 | `lib/input`'s click tests declared the pairing interval twice, in two units; the nanosecond form is now derived from the one `Duration64` |
| D219 | the figure-design fuzz harness never checked what an edit did |
| D220 | the figure designer adopted refusals over the drag in hand and overwrote choices it should keep |
| D221 | the figure crate kept per-species odds and the motion order in several places |
| D222 | the WinterSun figure plans and comments contradicted the code |
| D225 | the DMA quarantine rested on premises the kernel did not enforce |
| D227 | request drivers took any completion as the current request's once a chain was abandoned, and reused staging the device still held |
| D230 | a removed node's grants outlived it: its driver, and whatever that driver delegated to, kept the device's windows and interrupt lines, and a republished transport reached the old driver |
| D231 | `irq_bind` bound any line to any holder of `CAP_IRQ_BIND` |
| D232 | a shared region's reference was released after a teardown that failed part-way, so its frames could be freed under live entries |
| D233 | an xHCI enumeration retry replayed the requests its failed attempt left on the old EP0 ring, and retried without resetting the port |
| D236 | the charter-citation strip left broken sentences behind: parentheticals opening on a colon, semicolons running into a dash, sentences opening on one |
| D237 | the EMMC2 bring-up re-polled `ACMD41` back to back, with no interval, up to a million rounds |
| D226 | live drivers freed DMA memory their device could still own |
| D235 | a control transfer that did not complete left the device's EP0 unusable, so a device that never answered a string request failed its attach |
| D238 | a configuration's stray descriptors were taken as real interfaces and endpoints |
| D239 | the HID report parser misread hostile and unusual descriptors |
| D240 | a RAID member offered its window's region id where the composer needed its handle |
| D248 | the virtio test doubles were compiled into every production build |
| D249 | the mailbox service busy-spun its reply waits |
| D250 | virtio-net freed its receive buffers unscrubbed at teardown |
| D251 | the virtio mock host handed out pointers its own leak had invalidated |
| D253 | a device a controller reset moved to another index lost its node |
| D254 | a controller halted on the submit path was never recovered |
| D255 | a dead xHCI controller left the HCD idling, and a lost wait-set exited clean |
| D256 | a re-plugged device's driver was handed the previous device's buffer |
| D257 | an endpoint the event loop could not watch was bound again, never served |
| D258 | any process could steer the RAID composer with a forged offer |
| D259 | a member listing opened a second view of a window the array was using |
| D260 | a re-enumerated disk could never rejoin its array |
| D262 | any task could grow an endpoint server's grant table |
| D264 | a kept USB node reported a slot id a controller reset reassigned |
| D265 | a storage device without a serial number was kept across a reset on model and position alone |
| D266 | `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` documented the deleted keyboard scaffold's diagnostics as live, under ids the audit catalogue has since reissued; the table and the poll-loop paragraph are gone, the note says which ids were reissued, and the one live record the table carried, the boot path's `4100` PCIe discovery (still colliding with `FsNodeMutated`, D169), is named on its beacon row |
| D74 | EEVDF charged every dispatch a fixed service quantum regardless of how long it ran |
| D75 | EEVDF's ready set was a `Vec` scanned linearly on the dispatch path |
| D286 | a returning body's `Park` or `Yield` was applied over a remote park and wake that landed while it ran, losing the wake or queuing the task twice |
| D287 | a task a yield or an overflow drain moved to another CPU was queued there without a signal, so an idle CPU could leave it waiting |
| D288 | a CPU's competing weight drifted: a priority change while a task was counted, or a steal or migration racing a remote park, took off a different weight than went on |
| D289 | CFQ's and EEVDF's virtual time saturated `u64` within hours of CPU time on a gigahertz counter |
| D290 | the scheduler's intervals had no unit: MLFQ's boost interval and EEVDF's request were raw port ticks |
| D291 | a run-queue push allocated infallibly on the wake and yield paths, so memory exhaustion aborted the kernel |
| D292 | a task that left the real-time band by a yield kept the virtual time it left with and held the CPU until it caught up |
| D293 | `SchedulerPolicy::yield_current` was dead contract surface, and two crates' docs described it as the live `irq_wait` path |
| D295 | the aarch64 and riscv64 timer-HAL conformance tests installed and fired a tick callback in the preempt statics the preempt suite clears, holding none of its lock |
| D296 | a kill recorded its victim's death only after telling the scheduler to retire it, so a retire in between orphaned the death: the parent's `wait` hung and the process was never reclaimed (`stress-qemu-aarch64`); the same unsynchronised split let a death land twice, land on a queued thread, or retire a thread inside a kernel body |
| D301 | a kernel-init spawner built without a TLB shootdown built address spaces that never invalidated other CPUs; `KernelInitSpawner::new` now requires the shootdown and `KernelArch::cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown` has no default, so no port or spawner reaches no other CPU by omission, and every test kernel passes its port's own |
| D303 | a CPU in a shootdown mask with no LAPIC or hart mapping was skipped rather than widened; `CpuMask::reach` answers `None` for a mask naming a CPU the port cannot reach, and x86_64 and riscv64 then shoot down every CPU (`a_member_without_an_id_widens_the_reach_to_every_cpu`) |
| D304 | `vmm`'s `clear_lowest` was a `pub unsafe fn` with only in-crate callers and `attach_tlb`'s precondition was unenforced; both, with `reclaim_table_frames`, are crate-private, so only a live space's construction attaches a reach, and the `ptr` helpers are a private module whose dead `end_within` is gone |
| D305 | the CPU-mask layout was written in `retire.rs` and again in `xtlb.rs`, and one recording shootdown double three times; `CpuMask::words_for` and `CpuMask::slot` are the one layout `ActiveCpus` writes, and `RecordedRemote` (behind `host-tests`) is the one double the `retire`, `live` and `revoke` suites record through |
| D306 | a DMA region teardown that found a page already cleared returned before the remote shootdown and the snapshot retire, leaking the frames; a cleared page now counts as unmapped, the range is always shot down and retired, and a block still mapped or unscrubbable keeps its record for teardown to surrender (`a_free_that_finds_a_page_already_cleared_still_returns_the_block`, `a_block_that_cannot_be_scrubbed_stays_live_for_teardown`) |
| D308 | the autoload vertical's guest kept its own copy of the window-event endpoint tag; `tairix_abi::window_ipc::event_endpoint_for` and `is_event_endpoint` are the one definition, beside the other pid-derived endpoints, and the guest asks `is_event_endpoint` |
| D311 | a DMA free that failed part-way returned its custody reservation while its record stayed live for teardown to surrender, so the teardown's hold spent a reservation already returned — a block leaked for the boot, or another block's room taken; `free_dma` now returns a reservation exactly when its record leaves the window (`a_free_that_keeps_its_block_keeps_its_reservation_for_teardown`) |
| D312 | a DMA free that could not clear a page part-way retired its whole range, though the pages from the failure on were still mapped and still the driver's, and `DmaPool::free` promised a teardown surrender the kernel pool has no custodian for; only the pages cleared are retired, the doc states what becomes of a kept block, and `CpuMask::reach` is `#[must_use]` (`a_release_that_cannot_clear_a_page_retires_only_what_it_cleared`) |
| D313 | `lib/util::mathf`'s `sin`, `cos` and `tan` answered the value at 2^20 quarter turns for every larger angle; past it Payne and Hanek's reduction now runs in integers over a table of `2/PI`, so every finite angle reduces exactly and an infinite or `NaN` one as zero, pinned by `angles_past_a_million_quarter_turns_reduce_exactly` (exact references) and `angles_past_a_million_quarter_turns_track_a_correctly_rounded_libm` (every exponent) |
| D314 | `lib/window::app` recorded a refused present's damage as named, so a rectangle past the surface widened every later present into one the frame codec refused; `client::retained_damage` clips it to the window before it is painted or recorded, pinned by `a_rectangle_past_the_surface_is_sent_clipped_so_it_cannot_poison_later_presents` |
| D315 | the QEMU harness raised a marker's input flags before its dump flag, and a pointer step read the dump's first, so input could overtake the dump keyed on the same marker; `ReadinessFlags::watch_list` raises every dump flag first and `InjectionState::input_ready` reads the input's own flag first, pinned by `the_drain_raises_every_dump_before_any_input_it_could_gate` |
| D316 | screendumps were named per enrolment, so the flake hunt's concurrent replicas deleted and overwrote each other's; `screendump_path` makes each one of its run's sidecars, pinned by `sidecar_paths_never_collide_across_enrolments_or_replicas`, which now walks every dump |
| D319 | WinterSun's pinned digest lost the not-blank check on its own two frames; `the_frames_the_digest_folds_are_real_terrain_with_the_whole_cast` checks both, drawn through the digest's own `draw_frames` |
| D320 | the session asked whether every shown window was visible, a linear search each, on every presented frame; `report_on_screen` asks only about a window with an announcement pending, pinned by `a_frame_with_nothing_pending_never_asks_which_windows_are_visible` |
| D321 | `lib/util::mathf`'s `exp` saturated from 709 and answered zero from -708; its bounds are now the doubles nearest `ln(f64::MAX)` and `ln(f64::MIN_POSITIVE)`, and the scale is applied in two halves so `2^1024`'s side of the range is reached, pinned by `exponential_reaches_both_ends_of_the_double_range` |
| D322 | docs left stale by the move of `event_endpoint_for` and the re-send: `lib/window`'s README and the terminal's manifest name its home in `tairix_abi::window_ipc`, the README describes `try_present` and the re-send, `Compositor::has_damage` and the desktop pages say it answers what the next present sends (a refused frame included), and the Settings test's doc comment is back on its function |
| D324 | `tools/syshelp` planted a bundle directory named from an unchecked manifest `name`, and a named key was checked only when its step was reached after boot; `bundles::is_command_word` is the one rule the payload walk and the harness both apply (`a_bundle_name_is_a_plain_command_word`), and named keys are the closed `tairix_qemu::NamedKey` |
| D330 | x86_64's diverging exception stubs, its resumable ISR stubs (the timer and the TLB-shootdown IPI) and its `syscall` entry called Rust eight bytes off the System V stack alignment the compiler relies on for aligned spills; each enters with `%rsp ≡ 8 (mod 16)`, pinned by `stub_align_tests.rs`, which simulates every stub, the `#PF` and external-IRQ ones included, from its own source |
| D333 | the kernel post-mortem's field capacity left out the boot-stack guard's two fields, so a report at every cap — the full register set and backtrace, the regime and descriptor readings, an overrun verdict — dropped its deepest frames; the capacity counts every field a record can carry, pinned by `a_report_at_every_cap_drops_no_field`, and a port's own record refuses at build time a cause too wide for its capacity |
| D336 | a process kept running after whatever started it died — force-killing the desktop left every app it had launched running and unreachable, as did a logout, `login` dying, a terminal window closing and a service stopping — because the kernel grouped no processes; every process is now in a session that ends whole with its anchor (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`), pinned by `an_anchor_dying_kills_its_session_and_every_session_nested_in_it` and the `threads` verticals' session step on all three MMU ports |
| D337 | the Switchboard listed each parser-sandbox worker as a second copy of its owner (three `desktop`s, two each of `discoveryd`, `switchboard` and `timed` after one login); the process record carries the kernel's sandbox mark and the sampler folds a worker into its owner, pinned by `a_sandbox_worker_is_folded_into_the_program_that_started_it` |
| D338 | a kill landing between a child's capability record and its registration with its parent stranded the parent's `wait`; the record is inserted last, with the child's session, pinned by `a_kill_aimed_at_a_half_admitted_child_reaches_nothing` |
| D339 | the process list resolved each record's parent by a linear scan of every record; it reads the instance index, pinned by `the_process_domain_marks_a_sandbox_worker_and_names_its_owner` |
| D340 | `init`'s docs and audit event said PID 1 reaps inherited orphans, which the kernel never reparents; the event is `UNTRACKED_CHILD_REAPED`, pinned by `reap_distinguishes_service_exit_from_an_untracked_child` |
| D341 | a desktop session that died while switched away stayed a zombie and a live table entry until its user returned; `login` reaps it before each round, pinned by `a_session_that_ended_while_switched_away_is_no_longer_offered` |
| D342 | the mount and cache-ledger pages overflowed one `sysinfo` reply (64 × 224 and 64 × 128 bytes against 8188), so both lists failed once they grew long enough; every page is `reply_page` of its record and checked at build time, pinned by `a_mount_table_longer_than_one_reply_is_walked_whole` and `cache_ledger_walk_pages_until_short` over fixtures that refuse what the service refuses |
| D343 | closing a terminal window left its shell unreaped, and a foreground job that ignored end-of-file kept that shell alive with no window; the window's close ends the shell, whose session holds its jobs, and the loop reaps it, pinned by `a_shell_reap_names_a_load_failure_and_tells_gone_from_running` for the reap and the `threads` session step for the jobs |
| D344 | the peer-exit watch and the shared-memory region registry hashed ids whose live set an unprivileged user shapes under a predictable key, the D276 class; both build their tables under the per-boot key, pinned by `the_tables_are_built_under_the_published_key_at_the_first_watch` and `the_registry_hashes_under_the_published_key` |
| D346 | a process's CPU time, CPU and state in the process list were its leader thread's alone, and the load census counted each process once by its leader's state, so a multi-threaded process under-reported its CPU, read `Blocked` while a sibling ran, and its runnable threads were missing from the load; the process list reads the whole thread group under the table lock that lists it — summed time, the most active state, the first running thread's CPU — and the census counts threads, as `LoadAverage` documents. Pinned by `the_process_domain_and_the_load_census_read_a_whole_thread_group` and `a_group_reads_as_its_most_active_thread_and_their_summed_time` |
| D347 | the process-wait table scanned every row on each `wait` and every exit woke every waiter, and every wait-set waiter besides, on the machine; each parent's children are indexed as its own family, `WAIT_PID_ANY` takes the first child to exit, an exit or a stop wakes only its parent's key on `PROCWAIT_WAITQ`, a wait-set joins that queue only for a `Child` member, and the room an exit or a stop needs is reserved at registration, which is now fallible, so neither allocates. Pinned by `a_childs_exit_or_stop_wakes_only_its_own_parents_waiters`, `a_waitset_waits_on_child_exits_only_for_a_child_member`, `an_exit_or_a_stop_never_grows_a_familys_queues` and `wait_any_reaps_the_first_child_to_exit_first` |
| D348 | a two-level list's Right/Left tree keys were written twice, in `Tabs::tree_key` and the program-library popup, and the copies differed; `lib/controls`' `tree_step`, beside `DisclosureSet`, is the one rule both apply, `Tabs` keeping its refusal on an entry that refuses a press, pinned by the step cases in `disclosure_tests.rs` and `left_and_right_do_nothing_on_a_searchs_flat_matches` |
| D349 | the Widgets gallery never scrolled, so the Collections tab's 670 px column ran past its fixed 620 px window and its Panel item was never drawn; the panel scrolls beneath the strip through the shared `ScrollView` and a `ScrollBar` that holds its one offset and joins the focus ring while the column overflows, a wheel turn the widget under the pointer does not use scrolls the column, focus moved by `Tab` reveals its widget, each tab opens at its top, and an open choice list is drawn over the strip and the bar. Pinned by `every_item_of_every_tab_scrolls_into_view_and_is_drawn` (the window and an 800×300 screen) and `focus_reveals_what_it_lands_on_and_the_bar_scrolls_from_the_keyboard` |
| D350 | Settings' sidebar panel copied a pane group's plate radius and fill; `FieldGroup::plate_radius` and `FieldGroup::paint_plate` are the one plate both draw, pinned by `a_groups_plate_alone_is_the_plate_the_group_draws` and `the_sidebar_panel_is_a_groups_own_plate` |
| D351 | tests `62f11decf` lacked or that could not fail: the break-restate test now latches an entry before restating (`restating_a_strip_that_gained_a_break_resets_the_latch`); the settings-glyph test takes its kinds from the canonical kind table rather than a hand-kept list that had missed nine (`each_settings_category_glyph_is_its_own_mark`, `no_kind_but_the_placeholder_draws_the_placeholder`); a disabled section refuses Left (`a_disabled_section_refuses_the_tree_keys`); and a disclosure changes nothing while a search is in force (`a_disclosure_does_nothing_while_a_search_is_in_force`) |
| D352 | a disclosure, and every search keystroke, re-measured the Settings pane though only the strip changed; the strip is measured alone (`Shell::measure_strip`), pinned by `a_strip_change_leaves_the_pane_as_it_was_measured`. `Tab::is_group_break` and `Tab::disclosure` had test callers only and are now what `same_entries` and the tree step read, and the check for a category's listed panes is one `first_listed_pane` |
| D354 | spawn's first `unpark` of a child could be refused by a kill that claimed the record just published, a branch no test reached; the record, its session and the first wake land under one table write lock, so no claim falls between them, pinned by `a_child_is_started_under_the_lock_that_publishes_it`, and the signal producer no longer wakes or parks a registered child whose record is unpublished by its bare number, pinned by `no_signal_reaches_a_child_whose_record_is_unpublished` |
| D355 | `a_walk_past_one_batch_ends_every_member_whatever_departs_under_it` chose its departing member by admission order, but the session walk goes in process-id order and ids are drawn at random, so whenever that member drew the lowest id it was killed before the first pause could take it away (about one run in seventeen, depending on which ids earlier tests had drawn); the test chooses its two departures in walk order, one the batch in hand already holds and one a later batch would have collected, so both skip paths are reached on every run |
| D356 | a wall-clock read the session could not make left its clock's deadline in the past, so on a machine with no wall clock the serve loop woke at once, again and again; `SessionClock::missed` asks again a minute later, pinned by `a_failed_read_waits_a_minute_rather_than_spinning` |
| D357 | the pointer stayed visible over the screensaver: the compositor drew the cursor above every window, and a cursor refresh re-installed one the screensaver had dropped; whether the cursor is shown is the compositor's own state, apart from its artwork, pinned by `every_kind_covers_the_screen_and_hides_the_pointer`, `controller_keeps_a_hidden_cursor_hidden_and_current` and `a_hidden_cursor_draws_nothing_over_a_full_screen_window` |
| D358 | the display service released a client's configuration on any request it refused, so any process could unconfigure the desktop's display by sending it something malformed or naming a seat it did not hold; only the configuring lease's end or a newer `Configure` releases it, pinned by `a_stranger_refused_for_the_seat_leaves_the_owner_presenting` |
| D359 | x86_64 kernel and user space built soft-float with SSE disabled (rustc's `x86_64-unknown-none`), so floating point ran as libcalls and the SSE code paths compiled out, and the x87/MMX file was shared between tasks: ring 3 could run x87 with nothing saving it on a switch; both build for the first-party hard-float `x86_64-tairix-none`, every entry frames `xmm0`–`xmm15` and `MXCSR` under the kernel `MXCSR`, and the extended state is saved per task at park and loaded on the ring-3 exit (see the section), pinned by `fp_isolation_qemu_x86_64` under three CPU models, the stub simulations in `stub_align_tests.rs` and the model `every_return_to_ring_3_holds_the_tasks_own_state` |
| D360 | first entry to user mode zeroed no register on any port, so a new process started holding kernel pointers — the kernel's layout — and the previous context's vector residue; x86_64 zeroes every GPR but `rdi` and loads every extended component's initial state, aarch64 zeroes `x1`–`x30`, `v0`–`v31`, `FPCR` and `FPSR`, riscv64 every GPR but `sp`, `a0` and `tp`, pinned by the `entry_hygiene_program` fixture each `fp_isolation` vertical runs and the source pins `the_user_entry_leaves_no_kernel_register_state` |
| D361 | `lib/crypto` recorded a `sha256-hw` backend on x86_64 that could not run: on `target_os = "none"` `cpufeatures` answers only compile-time features, so `sha2` always ran its software path; `build_support::sha2_selects_hardware_at_runtime` offers the candidate only on a hosted x86_64 build, pinned by `only_a_hosted_x86_64_target_runs_the_hardware_path` |
| D362 | x86_64 reported AVX and AVX2 from CPUID alone, without checking the operating system had enabled the YMM state, so a routine dispatched on them would fault; `features_from_cpuid` also requires `OSXSAVE` and `XCR0` SSE and AVX, pinned by `avx_needs_the_os_to_have_enabled_the_ymm_state` |
| D364 | riscv64 switched no vector state and never cleared `sstatus.VS`, which OpenSBI leaves enabled on a hart with the V extension, so tasks there would share the vector registers, and `detect` offered `V` to user space; every task starts with `VS` off and `V` is decoded but not offered, pinned by `user_entry_starts_the_task_with_floating_point_and_vector_off` and `the_vector_unit_is_decoded_but_not_offered` |
| D365 | the x86_64 default ISR thunk (`interrupts.s`) called its Rust handler with `%rsp` eight bytes off the System V alignment, which an aligned SSE spill faults on once the kernel is hard-float; the thunk is a Rust naked function that aligns down before the call, pinned by `every_diverging_stub_enters_rust_aligned_under_the_kernel_mxcsr` |
| D366 | a re-list asked because a folder may have changed could be answered by a read of it already under way, which may have begun before the change, so the desktop or the file manager could show a folder without the name just created or renamed; `DirectorySource::refresh` asks for a read that begins after it and `ListingDesk::refresh` stamps the request, so an earlier read is dropped and the folder read anew — pinned by `a_refresh_is_never_answered_by_a_read_already_under_way` and `only_a_reload_asks_the_source_afresh` |
| D367 | Settings took the desktop's "a render is already pending" answer for a refusal of the picture, so while another window's render held the desktop's slot a picture it asked for kept its placeholder for good; the answer that the window holds all the renders the desktop runs is now waited on and the picture asked for again — pinned by `a_full_desktop_is_waited_on_never_taken_for_a_refusal` |
| D369 | the Raspberry Pi's EMMC2 card was clocked at 12.5 MHz for data, half SD Default Speed's 25 MHz, capping its 4-bit bus near 6 MB/s |
| D371 | two x86_64 FP-state model sweeps left the UB oracle through an in-source `#[cfg_attr(miri, ignore)]` while the miri registry reported `tairix-arch-x86_64` enrolled whole; the exclusion and its reason now sit in the registry's `LibExcept`, and `cfg-check` refuses an attribute `cfg` naming `miri` outside `tools/xtask/` — pinned by `an_interpreter_gate_is_caught_however_it_is_spelled` and the workspace scan |
| D372 | smoothstep was written out seven times — `saver/ribbon/light.rs`'s `edge`, `saver/starfield.rs`, `apps/cinder/src/fur.rs`, and `wintersun`'s `figure/src/clip.rs`, `figure/src/motion.rs`, `world/src/geom.rs` and `world/src/uplift.rs` — and `lib/raytrace`'s edged form restated its clamp and polynomial again; one clamped `lib/util::mathf::smoothstep`, with its `smoothstepf` twin, serves every floating-point caller, the ray tracer's edges mapped onto it, and the seven callers' inputs already lay in `0..=1`, so their results and the world generator's digests are unchanged — pinned by `smoothstep_is_clamped_monotone_and_flat_at_its_ends`, `single_precision_smoothstep_tracks_the_double_one` and `smoothstep_runs_from_nought_to_one_between_its_edges` |
| D375 | the ribbon painted nothing for an area reaching off the screen, where it should have painted the part on it; `Light::paint` clips the area to the screen first — pinned by `an_area_reaching_off_the_screen_paints_its_part_on_it` |
| D422 | the built-in pointer's outline was its body scaled six-fifths about its vertex mean, not an outline: the rim grew with an edge's distance from that point, so the I-beam's stem, the move and resize shafts had none, the arrow's was clipped off its top, and on a light window those edges vanished; an `Outline` is declared and stroked around the fitted silhouette a whole number of pixels wide, pinned by `every_builtin_cursor_keeps_its_rim_between_body_and_background`, `every_shipped_cursor_keeps_its_rim_between_body_and_background` and `an_outline_is_a_whole_number_of_pixels_wide_on_every_edge` |
| D423 | cursors were stretched onto the pixel side with no fitting, so at every size but the one a set was drawn for — 125%, 150%, every larger pointer size — their straight edges fell part-way across pixels and smeared; the artwork is fitted to the side's pixel grid from the hotspot, each edge split where the fit bends, pinned by `every_upright_and_level_edge_lands_on_a_pixel_boundary`, `the_hotspot_is_the_pixel_corner_the_artwork_is_laid_out_from`, `artwork_symmetric_about_its_hotspot_fits_symmetric_at_every_side` and `pieces_that_overlapped_still_overlap_once_fitted` |
| D424 | the shipped High Visibility move cursor drew as a dotted diamond, both sets' pointing hand was a staircase block, and that set's halo was a drawn stroke of uneven weight; both sets are redrawn and the shipped one declares its rim, pinned by `every_shipped_move_cursor_is_four_arrows` and `the_builtin_move_cursor_is_four_arrows` |
| D425 | a stroke's rectangle met the join at its end part-way along its own end edge, so once each piece's vertices were rounded onto the design grid the two parted by a sliver and a stroked ring showed hairlines of background along its centre line; each rectangle carries its segment's end points, pinned by `a_stroke_is_whole_where_its_pieces_meet` |
| D426 | a round join or cap was a disc of any number of steps, so a stroke of symmetric artwork came out lopsided by a few levels; the steps are a multiple of four, pinned by `a_round_disc_is_as_symmetric_as_the_square` |
| D451 | the minimal clock's ribbon followed the wall clock on a late wake, so a stalled frame jumped it as far as the stall, where every animated screensaver is documented to move at most a few frames; it accumulates its own time, each step held to the shared `SceneClock::MOST_FRAMES` — pinned by `a_late_wake_moves_the_scene_no_more_than_a_few_frames` |
| D470 | every windowed `Run` binary carried its own copy of `fail`, `fail_shell` and `report`; each states its reasons through the shared `tairix_window::app::{fail, report}`, which take any `Display`, and the greeter's audit record rides beside them |
| D477 | DMA translation's failure paths left a device reaching memory the kernel reused; each unconfirmed map, attach, unmap and domain end is kept out of reuse until the unit confirms, firmware's standing fault status is cleared at take-over, and every discovered unit's registers are guarded whatever its outcome |
| D478 | a virtio function behind a translation unit that declined `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM` was driven untranslated; discovery reads its offered features through the PCI configuration-access window and refuses to publish one that would bypass the unit, before any interrupt is routed or bus mastering enabled, audited `DmaTranslationBypass` |
| D480 | device addresses were confused with CPU addresses in the virtio drivers; the mock host tags every device address so a CPU pointer handed to the device faults, `DmaSlab::device_addr_at(offset, len)` bounds every sub-range, and the `phys` names that carried device addresses are renamed |
| D481 | ACPI DMAR discovery accepted overlapping units and a shared catch-all, resolved off-segment scopes through the wrong configuration space, and placed a window firmware named twice; units are validated for disjoint windows, a reserved window is resolved only on the probe's segment and deduplicated, and a unit with no node brings nothing up |
| D482 | the IOMMU merge's smaller seams: deps-check enforces the `kernel/iommu/*` layering row, a family's register layout is a charter carve-out, the silent table carries a non-zero domain id, unconfirmed carves are audited, the page-table engine and `vtd` share one `TableMemory` that orders a new table before its link, and the PCI address layout has one definition in `lib/abi` (the IOVA sorted-vector free list is IOM20's) |
| D488 | the Switchboard spelled the memory-pressure band with a private table (`nominal`, `elevated`, …) that disagreed with the kernel's own `PRESSURE_BAND_NAMES`; every surface now names a band through `tairix_abi::sysinfo::MemoryBand`, pinned by `every_band_depth_is_named_and_none_past_the_deepest_exists` and `the_memory_pane_names_every_band_as_the_system_information_api_does` |
| D489 | the Switchboard drew an interface's rates eight times too high: the stack's rate records carry bits a second and the pane spelled them as bytes; `NetInterfaceRatesRecord::{rx,tx}_bytes_per_sec` is the one conversion, pinned by `rates_record_round_trips_and_fails_closed` and `an_interfaces_served_rate_is_spelled_in_bytes_as_its_trace_is` |

## Scope

The open items, in priority order:

- **D164 — 22 userland programs allocate fixed start-up buffers with
  `vec!` (OPEN).** A `vec![0u8; N]` whose allocation fails panics through the
  allocation-error path, where the charter wants a typed error the program
  reports before it exits. Each is a buffer of a few KiB taken once at start,
  so the process could do nothing useful without it, but the exit should be a
  stated refusal rather than a panic. New code takes
  `tairix_util::fallible::filled` (`discoveryd` does); converting the rest is a
  per-program sweep, noticed while converting `timed` and `lib/resolver` for
  D161.
- **D165 — the SVG decoder admitted a pattern tile the renderer refuses —
  FIXED.** Found by `fuzz_svg` (seed `17573740323154604255`): a tile placed
  under `scale(1e5)` inverts into a `to_tile` whose determinant is below
  `Affine::invert`'s absolute floor, so the decoder accepted it and the
  renderer, sizing the tile through that inverse, refused the whole drawing —
  an icon failing to its lower tier over one fill. `PaintServers::pattern`
  now requires the round trip the renderer takes and resolves a placement
  magnified past it to no paint, exactly as it does a collapsed one.
  `a_tile_magnified_past_the_renderers_precision_paints_nothing`
  (`lib/svg`), which fails without the fix.
- **D163 — `netstack` exited on every start-up failure without stating why
  — FIXED.** Six refusals (an endpoint not bound or not watched, the
  wait-set not created, the service's own origin unread) returned `1`
  silently. Every start-up refusal, and the new no-entropy one (D161), now
  records `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (`16_028`) with its reason before exiting;
  `bind_endpoints` returns a reason for each of its refusals so none can be
  added without one. The exits are in the freestanding binary, which no host
  test can drive into a failed endpoint bind; the id is pinned by the
  event-registry tests.
- **D162 — the kernel never seeded its CSPRNG on a port whose hardware RNG
  is declared `Pending` — FIXED.** `seed_entropy_reserve` returned as soon as
  the port's profile said `Pending`, before the jitter, interrupt, and FDT
  boot-seed sources were mixed in — so riscv64, whose `Zkr` is pending and
  whose boot path captures `/chosen/rng-seed` precisely so it can seed,
  never did: `random_get` failed for the life of every riscv64 boot, ramzip
  never came online, and process ids lost their unpredictable half.
  `ArchEntropy::new` now keeps a port's handle only when its profile provides
  hardware entropy, so a pending source withholds only itself and is never
  touched, and the seed always mixes every source; the audit names the ones
  able to contribute (`bootseed` on a riscv64 guest).
  `a_pending_hardware_source_still_leaves_the_boot_seed_to_seed_the_reserve`,
  `a_port_with_no_usable_source_contributes_nothing_and_is_never_drawn`, and
  `the_seed_audit_names_exactly_the_sources_that_can_contribute`
  (`kernel/core`).
- **D161 — userland carried on with zeros when `random_get` refused —
  FIXED.** Eight call sites discarded the result: `netstack`'s SYN-cookie key
  (all-zero cookies, forgeable by anyone), its TCP initial sequence numbers
  and ephemeral ports (the only one ever tried was `49152`), DHCPv4 transaction ids and IPv4
  identification seeds; the resolver's DNS query ids; `timed`'s NTP nonces.
  On riscv64 (D162) that was every boot. `tairix_rt::random_fill` is now the
  one checked draw — the whole buffer or a typed refusal — and the raw
  `random_get` wrapper is private to the runtime, so the discard cannot be
  written outside it. Per-event values come from a `FastRng` keyed once by
  `FastRng::keyed_by(tairix_rt::random_fill)`, which builds nothing from a
  refused draw and costs one syscall per program rather than one per value;
  `fork` gives each netstack interface's DHCP client and RFC 8981 source its
  own stream. `netstack` refuses to serve without its secrets, `timed` and
  the resolver refuse to run without their generators, and the cookie key
  lives in a buffer wiped on drop. `the_checked_draw_is_whole_or_refused` and
  `the_checked_draw_takes_a_long_buffer_in_turns` (`lib/rt`),
  `a_refusing_source_builds_no_generator` and
  `a_fork_is_independent_of_its_parent_and_of_its_siblings` (`lib/rng`),
  `a_refused_draw_builds_no_secret` (`netstack`).
- **D160 — a sandbox session's parent allocated each worker-declared frame
  infallibly — FIXED.** A hostile worker declaring in-bound frames under
  memory pressure could abort the process supervising it. `SandboxSession::recv`
  now lends each frame in place and allocates nothing, and
  `proto::recv_frame_into` reserves fallibly (`ProtoError::OutOfMemory`) and
  is reused by the worker loops, which hold one buffer for the session.
  `one_reused_buffer_receives_consecutive_frames_exactly` (`lib/sandbox`).
- **D159 — the mDNS engine charged the shared reply budget before the
  per-peer one — FIXED.** A peer past its own budget still spent the
  interface's, so one flooding asker starved every other peer of unicast
  answers. `rate::PeerBudgets` is the one per-peer budget table, peer bucket
  first; the engine and `discoveryd`'s relay admission share it.
  `a_peer_past_its_reply_budget_cannot_spend_the_interfaces` (engine) and the
  `rate_tests` suite, checked against the old order by mutation.
- **D158 — `timed`, `ping`, and `telnet` bound fixed delivery port ids —
  FIXED.** The port registry is machine-wide, so whichever process bound
  `0x6e74_7071` first denied `timed` its NTP replies for the boot, and
  likewise `ping`'s and `telnet`'s. `tairix_rt::bind_private_port` draws an
  unreserved id from the CSPRNG under a bounded budget that fails closed, and
  every socket client (and `telnet`'s keyboard port) binds through it.
  `a_private_port_is_never_bound_unless_its_id_was_drawn` (`lib/rt`).
- **D157 — socket clients pinned whichever sender posted first as the stack
  — FIXED.** A delivery port is an inbox anyone may post to: a forged first
  post was pinned as the network stack, and a restarted stack was refused by
  every client that had pinned its predecessor. The `tairix_rt::net` receives
  now authenticate each message's kernel-attested sender as the stack's
  service account (`tairix_abi::net::NETSTACK_UID`, user trust domain) and
  discard any other unread; the four private pinning copies are deleted.
  `only_the_stack_service_account_is_the_network_stack` (`lib/abi`).
- **D156 — `cap_delegate` let any task narrow any other task — FIXED.** The
  syscall looked the target up and narrowed it with no authority check, so
  any process could strip any other of its capabilities by naming its pid.
  `CapTable::narrow` admits the caller itself or a live child — matched on the
  minted process instance, never a recyclable pid — and anyone else only for
  a `CAP_USER_ADMIN` holder; without it an unknown target is refused exactly
  like an unrelated one, so the call is no oracle for which pids exist, and
  the refusal is audited (`TaskCapabilitiesDelegateDenied`, `1024`).
  `cap_delegate_refuses_an_unrelated_target_without_user_admin` and six
  `CapTable::narrow` tests (`kernel/sec`).
- **D151 — every in-tree fuzz harness drew its structural choices from an
  unmixed LCG's low bits — FIXED.** `tairix_fuzzseed::Prng` (SplitMix64,
  pinned to the reference stream) is the one generator every harness, soak and
  randomised test draws from: every output bit is mixed, and the bounded draws
  (`below`, `at_most`, `pick`) reduce by multiply-shift from the high word, so
  no choice rests on a low bit. No private generator remains — the
  `struct Lcg`s, the inline closures, the xorshift64* and SplitMix64 copies,
  and the per-file `bounded`/`low_byte`/`index` helpers are deleted — and the
  entropy stand-ins are one shared test module each in `lib/rng` and
  `kernel/core`. The one exception is code under test that consumes `lib/rng`'s
  `RandU64`, which its tests feed from `NonCryptoRng`.
  `no_low_bit_repeats_on_a_power_of_two_period` and
  `a_power_of_two_bound_is_not_a_fixed_cycle` fail for any power-of-two LCG;
  `docs/src/security/fuzzing.md` states the rule.
- **D150 — the boot stack had no overrun detector on any port — FIXED.** The
  MMU is off while the boot stack is in use, so the guard is poison rather
  than a hole: every port reserves 4 KiB below the stack (the linker script on
  aarch64 and riscv64, `boot.s` on x86_64), the boot stub fills it with
  `lib/memguard`'s `GUARD_BYTE` — handed in as a `global_asm!` const operand,
  so assembly never re-spells the sentinel — and
  `CpuStateCapture::boot_stack_guard` gives the panic record its verdict: an
  `sp` below the stack first, else the canary's `intact` or `disturbed`. The
  `bootguard_qemu_*` verticals prove reservation, fill and handle on all three
  bare-metal ports. The panic path and the ports' own fault reports read
  the verdict, so a minimal test kernel's CPU fault names it too (D146).
  The record is
  `plans/FIX-PANICS.md`.
- **D149 — icon artwork landing repainted the whole icon bar and the whole
  library popup — FIXED.** `ArtworkDesk::take_landed` answers a
  `tairix_icon::Landed` naming the decodes that came back, and each surface
  latches only what the batch moved: the slots whose `AppSlot` changed (the
  strip whole only when the slot count re-lays it), the popup row whose picture
  changed, and the bar controls that resolve class artwork as they paint.
  `plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md` C.7.
- **D148 — the hover gate's damage bound was exhausted by a desktop that
  re-damaged its whole icon bar after every published frame — FIXED.** The
  library popup's one-shot "seen" witness fired through
  `Taskbar::library_mut`, a borrow that latches the whole bar and popup, so a
  calm desktop recomposed a full-width strip every frame. It now reports
  through `Taskbar::report_library_shown`, which latches nothing, and arriving
  desktop-icon artwork marks its cells (`Desktop::mark_icons`) rather than the
  layer. The hover vertical bounds total damage rather than a per-frame mean,
  so a host's frame count cannot move it. `plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md` C.7.
- **D147 — host tests hand-picked the task ids they keyed process-global
  registry state on — FIXED.** The call-endpoint registry, the wait-set table
  and the shared-region table are scrubbed by task id on `exit`, which sibling
  tests drive holding no registry guard, so a test that named its principal by
  a literal lost in-flight state to a sibling's reclaim of that number. A
  `test_boot::claim_task` claim is now a 16-id block above every hand-spelt and
  scheduler-drawn id and `claim_peer_task` hands out the rest of it, so a test
  modelling several principals names each without picking one; the owners,
  posters and exiting tasks those registries are keyed on now come from
  claims, save the few literals D118 records.
  `only_the_posters_own_reclaim_cancels_an_in_service_call` pins that a reclaim
  below the floor leaves a claimed poster's call alone.
- **D129 — the `SleepLock` releaser deleted a live waiter's re-registered
  row — FIXED.** SMP-only: about half of all four-CPU boots stopped at the
  `ARXFS passphrase:` prompt with no input driver loaded. A wait-queue row was
  named by task id alone, so the delete D112's fix introduced landed on a
  *newer* park than the one the scan examined, and the lock was then released
  with `CONTENDED` clear so no later release consulted the queue. Compounded
  by `unpark` reporting `Err` for a live task whose `Parked -> Ready` claim
  lost to a concurrent waker. Rows now carry a never-reused registration
  identity, the park/unpark handshake is one definition in
  `kernel/sched/api::park` with an honest error contract, and the enrolment
  gained a four-CPU row for the unlock -> store-scan -> autoload chain. The
  authoritative record is `plans/FIX-SLEEPLOCK.md` (S1, S3, S4, S6).
- **D138 — the desktop-pressure vertical photographed its baseline before the
  bar had drawn a slot — FIXED.** A test defect, not a desktop one: the reveal
  marker and the slot-drawn marker have no ordering, so under parallel load the
  artwork baseline was taken with the slot empty and the vertical reported the
  desktop as having dropped artwork it had not yet drawn. The baseline and the
  pointer script now wait on `APP_BAR_SETTLED`, the session's witness for a
  revealed bar holding its resolved pictures; see the section.
- **D137 — the blocking `wait` parked the calling thread but registered its
  process — FIXED.** A non-leader thread reaping a child registered the
  group's *leader* on `PROCWAIT_WAITQ` and parked *itself*, so the exit woke
  the wrong task and the real waiter slept for the rest of the boot —
  `view.app`'s third document never appeared because its decode worker was
  that thread. `ProcessWait::wait` now takes the waiting `TaskId` beside the
  `ProcessId` its table is keyed by; see the section.
- **D130 — a retired thread's rows outlived it and ate counted wakes —
  FIXED.** Nothing deregistered a task on its behalf, and the batched wakes
  counted the unparks they *issued*, so `wake_n(_, 1)` over a retired head
  reported a wake it never delivered — a lost `FUTEX_WAKE` with a live waiter
  still parked. Wakes now count what landed and reap what could not, and
  `threads::retire` drops the thread's rows from every queue and futex key.
  `plans/FIX-SLEEPLOCK.md` (S2, S5).

- **D1 — FIX-SYSCALL residual verticals** (x86_64/riscv64 syscall-body
  tests + metal re-confirmation). The design and code are done; the
  per-arch conformance verticals are not.
- **D2 — P-6: wait-queue §27 completeness rework — DONE.** The
  foundational primitive (`kernel/core/src/waitq.rs`) shipped as a thin
  slice; §27 required the complete primitive. Landed (three-index
  O(log n) `WaitSet` with a stated FIFO no-starvation discipline).
- **D3 — Hard-lockup watchdog parity** on x86_64 and riscv64 (aarch64
  is the only port with hard-lockup detection wired).
- **D4 — Latent §27 audit sweep — DONE.** The other foundational
  primitives (`lib/sync`, IPC/capability structures, allocators,
  `lib/collections`) were audited against §27. All are complete; `waitq`
  (D2) was the sole thin slice. One latent watch-item (the slab
  free-slot scan) is recorded and staged (not a live defect).
- **D51 — a byte-stream transfer staged the caller's whole declared length,
  not one ring — DONE.** `parked_stream_read` / `parked_stream_write` capped
  the staging buffer at `FS_IO_MAX` (1 MiB) while every backing they serve
  buffers exactly one `PIPE_CAPACITY` (64 KiB) ring, so a caller handing a
  whole payload to one call made the kernel allocate and zero a megabyte of
  heap, copy a megabyte across the user boundary, then discard all but 64 KiB
  of it. The parser-sandbox seam does exactly that (`send_frame` writes the
  entire payload in one `Channel::write`), so placing one 2.5 MB wallpaper
  master cost ~64 MiB of kernel-heap alloc/memset/copy in 1 MiB units, both
  directions — and `copy_in_user` restarts its copy from the buffer base
  after each demand-fault miss, so a large stage over first-touch user memory
  re-copied quadratically. Fixed by one shared `stream_stage_len` bound: both
  loops stage at most one ring and answer short, which the caller already
  loops on. Measured context: the decoder was never the cost — a shipped
  master decodes in about 15 ms at thumbnail scale, ~90 ms full-screen.
- **D61 — the stream write path registered for its wake *after* the poll that
  found the ring full — DONE.** `parked_stream_write` registered on the stream
  wait-queue inside the `Full` arm, so between the poll and the registration a
  peer that drained the ring woke only the tasks registered at that instant,
  and woke nobody. The writer then parked with `NO_DEADLINE` on space that had
  already freed, released only when unrelated pipe traffic happened to
  broadcast — a multi-second stall by construction, and an outright hang
  whenever the transfer was the machine's only pipe activity. The read path
  had the correct discipline and its own comment explaining it. Fixed by
  registering before the first poll and deregistering once the loop is left,
  matching the read path; the regression test observes the registration from
  inside the first step via `wake_waiter`'s registered/not answer.
- **D62 — the stream wait-queue was one global queue woken with `wake_all` —
  DONE.** Every 64 KiB chunk moved on *any* pipe or pty unparked every stream
  waiter on the machine, each of which re-polled its own unrelated backing and
  parked again, and each `wake_all` heap-allocated a `Vec` of the waiter ids.
  On a desktop with a sandbox worker per app plus shell ptys that is a
  double-figure thundering herd per chunk, so one app streaming a gallery
  taxed every other pipe user — a §2.16 / §27 defect, not a correctness one (a
  spurious wake is harmless). Closed by keying the waiters rather than
  splitting the queue: a `WaitQueue` registration is now `(WakeKey, TaskId)`
  key-major, so `wake_key` releases one condition's waiters as an O(log n +
  woken) range and `wake_all` stays what a genuine queue-wide broadcast uses.
  Each bounded ring mints its own `RingWaits` pair (bytes, space) — one pair
  per pipe, two per pty — and every park, transfer wake, last-end close, and
  `waitset_wait` `Stream` member names the one side it concerns. Keeping the
  single queue is what keeps the timed `sweep` / `earliest_deadline` /
  `nearest_timed_deadline` machinery unchanged: a timed `stream_read` needs no
  per-object queue for the sweep to enumerate. A `Stream` member resolves its
  ring once at wait entry, so the wait follows the object the descriptor held
  then; a sibling thread swapping that descriptor number mid-wait cannot be
  followed (the swap can always land between a re-resolution and the peer's
  write) and the readiness scan, which re-resolves the number, stops reporting
  the retired stream.
  Two further defects fell out of it. `PipeEnd`/pty-end `Drop` woke on *every*
  release, so a spawn's or a `stream_read` snapshot's clone/drop pair woke
  waiters for a condition that had not changed; only the last end of a side
  now wakes, and it wakes exactly the two conditions its departure retires.
  And `terminal_purge` on a pty flagged `console_wake` for the ring space its
  discard had just freed — the wrong queue entirely, so the parked writer was
  released only by unrelated pipe traffic and, once the broadcast was gone,
  never; `Pty::purge_session` now wakes both rings' space itself, where no
  caller can pick the wrong queue.
- **D66 — `DriverError::Busy` carried three unrelated meanings, and the generic
  mapping turned one of them into an I/O error — DONE.** Every distinguishable
  filesystem conflict now has its own driver value, so the VFS no longer
  disambiguates by which mapper the call site picked.
- **D84 — the sleeping mutex released the lock word after deciding nobody was
  waiting, so a contender that published in that window slept for ever —
  DONE.** The `stress_qemu_aarch64` early-boot silence recorded under D13 as a
  masked-section wedge. It is not one: every core is idle. Detail below.
- **D83 — on x86_64 only a page fault reached the fatal-fault report; every
  other kernel-mode exception died mutely — FIXED.** Each of vectors `0..=31`
  now carries a stub naming itself and its error code, funnelled into one
  fatal tail; the vector is packed into the neutral syndrome so a record can
  say which exception fired. Detail below.
- **D82 — refining a live translation is a break-before-make violation —
  FIXED.** kthread kernel stacks are runs of the shared kernel remap window
  with an unmapped guard slot, so no root refines a block for a guard page
  and the split surface is deleted. Detail below.
- **D85 — an unexpected interrupt at an uninstalled x86_64 vector parks with
  no record, and a spurious LAPIC interrupt is treated as fatal — OPEN.** The
  D83 shape surviving for vectors `32..=255`, which still share one
  vector-agnostic thunk.
- **D86 — on x86_64 a ring-3 exception other than a page fault killed the
  machine instead of the task — FIXED.** The port now has the sibling
  ports' terminator slot, and which vectors may be charged to a ring-3 task
  is a declared column of the one exception-vector table (the `#NMI`/`#DF`
  IST routes never are). D42 is the `#PF` half; one change closed both.
- **D54 — a desktop worker thread issued ~2500 file opens at session start,
  starving every concurrent reader — CLOSED.** It was the measured whole of
  the read-throughput gap `plans/FIX-KHEAP.md` reported. It no longer
  reproduces on its own vertical; detail below.
- **D73 — a woken task was placed *level* with the ready population, so the
  `(vruntime, id)` tie-break starved every task spawned after a set of CPU
  hogs — FIXED.** An interactive program's asynchronous bundle load took
  59–120 s while ten CPU-bound tasks saturated four CPUs. `admit_weight`
  returned the *leftmost ready entry*, which guarantees a tie with the task
  that would be picked next, and the ready set is keyed `(vruntime, TaskId)` —
  so the lower id won every time and a later-spawned task lost a full
  scheduling round on every wake. Recorded first as a second D68; renumbered
  here because the guard-arena D68 owns that id in code and docs. Detail
  below.
- **D74 — EEVDF charged every dispatch a fixed service quantum regardless of
  how long it ran — FIXED.** A run that requeues is now charged the ticks it
  used, so CPU time, not dispatch count, is shared by weight; one that parks
  is not, since its task rejoins with zero lag. Detail below.
- **D75 — EEVDF's ready set was a `Vec` scanned linearly on the dispatch
  path — FIXED.** Two binary heaps give an `O(log n)` amortised pick. Detail
  below.
- **D50 — the flake hunt's concurrent replicas re-planted one guest's backing
  image underneath itself — DONE.** Up to four simultaneous runs of one
  enrolment shared a planted-image path, so a replica rewrote a live sibling's
  disk mid-run. Sidecar paths are now per-run, not per-binary.
- **D57 — the first tightening of memory stopped every cache in the system
  from admitting, and took the desktop's pictures with it — DONE.** Reported
  as "32 terminal windows and the icons all become the same white silhouette
  and the desktop stops responding". Reproduced on the aarch64 `virt` board at
  the default 256 MiB: windows 1–24 opened in a fifth of a second each, then
  25 took 9 s, 26 took 29 s, 27 took 65 s and 28 took 118 s, with ~1800
  `fs_open`/`fs_write` pairs and ~1500 font-endpoint calls per 6000 audit
  lines — every icon re-read and re-decoded and every glyph re-fetched, per
  repaint. Three defects, all in the shared reclaim model:
  - `GrowthAllowance::permits` refused **all** cache growth in any band above
    normal (below 20% free), contradicting `shrink_target`'s own per-class
    ceilings: a class the policy says to preserve could keep what it held but
    never admit again, so every cache in the system — kernel filesystem
    metadata, block, launch, transform — decayed to uselessness while its
    ledger read healthy. Admission now reads the same `shrink_target` a forced
    shrink evicts to, so growth and shrink are one policy.
  - The desktop's decoded icons and client-side glyphs were classed as
    drop-at-mild disposable UI, though rebuilding one needs a capability-gated
    read plus a parser-sandbox round trip (icons) or an IPC round trip
    (glyphs) — the resources a machine short of memory has least of. Both now
    declare a display-derived working-set floor that mild and moderate leave
    alone; severe and critical still take everything.
  - A retention refusal was re-attempted every round for ever.
    `ArtworkResolver::declined` reports it and the session's icon desk holds
    that key back until the band moves.
  The same reproduction now completes in 30 s with the bar drawing its real
  artwork throughout, and is enrolled as
  `tests/integration/desktop_pressure_qemu_aarch64` — the guest passing only
  when the published band really left normal, so it cannot pass without having
  tested the state it is named for. Adjacent and **not** fixed by this: D54,
  the session-start burst of file opens from the same worker.
- **D58 — three window counts stood in for the bytes a window actually costs
  — DONE.** Found while fixing D57. The session bounded one client to 32
  *windows* (`WINDOWS_PER_CLIENT_MAX`), a figure that says nothing about the
  address space it maps for them: 32 windows of a 4K frame is a gigabyte,
  while a hundred terminal windows are a few tens of megabytes — and a resize,
  which is the other way a client grows what the session holds, was not
  bounded at all. It is now a byte budget derived from the machine's RAM
  (`client_frame_budget_bytes`), charged by creates, popups, and resizes
  alike. The terminal (32) and the file manager (8) each carried a further
  hand-picked count in front of it; both are gone, because every resource they
  stood for — the frame region, the pty, the shell child — is already bounded
  by something derived and fail-closed that those apps already report.
- **D59 — the release that was meant to bound many-window memory freed
  nothing, and reached only one of a window's three copies — DONE.** Found by
  reading the release ladder while answering "can 32 windows of a 4K frame cost
  less than a gigabyte". Two halves:
  - The compositor released a *hidden* window's pixels and, in the same wake,
    asked its client to present again; the client did, the buffer was
    established afresh, and the bytes came straight back. At mild pressure —
    the band where only hidden windows are released — the ladder therefore
    freed nothing and cost one repaint per hidden window while the machine was
    short of memory. Every compositor test passed: they call the release
    directly and none models the session delivering the redraw it queued. The
    request is now made by `set_visible` when the window is next shown, which
    that path already did.
  - A window's pixels exist three times — the app's render target, the frame
    region, and the compositor's converted copy — and the pages behind the
    region go only when *both* sides unmap it. The session released only its
    own, so a hidden 4K window still cost ~64 MiB of the ~96 it had. It now
    unmaps its side (`WindowServer::release_frames`) and tells the client
    (`WindowEvent::ContentReleased`, `Errno::NotAttached` on a present against
    a released window), which lets go of its own two and re-attaches on the
    paint that follows the next redraw request.
  A third half was found later, by reading the ladder's trigger rather than its
  body: it ran **only** on the pressure band's wake, and that wake is
  edge-triggered. A user minimising a window on a machine whose pressure had
  already settled produced no edge, so the release never ran for the ordinary
  sequence — get tight, then put a window away — and the largest block the
  desktop can give back was freed only if the band happened to move again. The
  ladder's inputs are the band *and* each window's visibility, so it now runs
  on either edge: `Compositor::set_visible` applies the same per-window
  decision to the window it has just hidden, and the session drains the
  released notices on the input wake as well as the band's. A
  minimise-then-restore inside one wake withdraws its own undrained notice,
  since neither side has let go and telling the client would cost an unmap and
  a re-attach that change nothing.
  Two smaller defects fell out of that reading. The session recorded nothing
  when it handed a window's frames back, though every other reclaim decision on
  the machine is logged and this is the largest of them
  (`CONTENT_RELEASED`, naming the window and the bytes). And `WINDOW_SHOWN` —
  "a frame carrying this window's own pixels reached the display" — stayed
  latched across a release, so a window released and never re-presented still
  read as shown; `SessionWindows::content_released` puts the record back to
  awaited and the frame that brings the pixels back announces it afresh.
  Adjacent, deliberate, and **not** changed: the session keeps converting each
  present into its own copy rather than compositing from the client's buffer.
  That would halve a *visible* window's cost, but it moves the
  straight-alpha-to-premultiplied conversion from once per damaged pixel to
  once per composited pixel per frame and gives up the stable snapshot, which
  is a speed and integrity trade rather than a win; the zero-copy path for
  visible windows is the hardware layer scanout `plans/FIX-DISPLAY-ACCELERATION.md`
  stages.
- **D60 — the window-content release has no end-to-end vertical: the one
  claim only a live desktop can settle is untested — OPEN.** Stated when D59
  landed. Every seam of the release path is host-tested — the engine's
  release/re-attach and the byte budget dropping a released window to zero
  (`lib/window/src/tests.rs`), the compositor's deferral and released-notice
  queue (`userland/gui/wm/src/tests.rs`), the session's trim producing the
  notice (`userland/gui/session/src/windows.rs`), the `ContentReleased` wire
  round trip (`lib/abi/src/window_ipc.rs`) — but no QEMU run has ever taken a
  window through *release → client lets go → shown again → re-attach → its
  pixels back*.
  - **Why the existing vertical does not reach it.**
    `tests/integration/desktop_pressure_qemu_aarch64` gets the machine into a
    non-normal band with a screenful of terminal windows, but
    `release_content_under_pressure` only takes a window that is **not
    visible**, and visibility there is an explicit flag rather than occlusion:
    cascaded windows are all visible, however deeply stacked, so at mild and
    moderate pressure the ladder correctly releases nothing. Only critical
    pressure touches visible windows, and it spares the focused one.
  - **The groundwork is in, and it found the defect the coverage was missing.**
    Reading the release ladder's *trigger* while designing this vertical
    surfaced the third half of D59: the ladder ran only on the band's
    edge-triggered wake, so "minimise a window on an already-tight machine"
    released nothing. That is fixed and host-tested
    (`userland/gui/wm/src/tests.rs`, `userland/gui/session/src/windows.rs`), and
    with it the two markers a vertical needs now exist: the session's
    `CONTENT_RELEASED` record and a `WINDOW_SHOWN` that is re-earned after a
    release.
  - **Two things in the design above do not work; use these instead.**
    - `shm_unmap` is `audit: false` in the syscall table (an unprivileged
      release of the caller's own mapping, the same posture as `mem_unmap`), so
      the client's half of a release is *not* in the audit trail and cannot be
      the guest's witness. Turning auditing on for it to make a test observable
      would shape production for the test. Witness the **re-attach** instead —
      `sc=shm_create` + `sc=shm_grant` attributed by `comm` to the app under
      test, which `ProcName::from_path` sets to the bundle's stem — and take the
      release from the session's own `CONTENT_RELEASED` record on serial.
    - The window cannot be a *terminal* window restored from its icon-bar slot.
      The terminal declares a default action, so a primary click on its slot is
      relayed to the app and opens **another** window; only an application that
      declares none (`tairix_window::info_and_quit`) gets
      `TaskbarResponse::AppRaise`, which is what shows a minimised window
      again. Use such an app — `widgets` is the smallest: no filesystem, no
      arguments, a fixed 820×620 window, and it is listed in the program
      library.
  - **The shape that works.** Reach pressure the proven way (the existing
    screenful of terminal windows), launch `widgets`, then drive two full
    cycles: raise it, maximise it so its body covers screen the cascade cannot
    reach, minimise it, and restore it from its slot. Gate causally throughout —
    the reveal witness, then per-window `WINDOW_SHOWN` occurrences, then
    `CONTENT_RELEASED` — and photograph the frame after the *first* restore,
    holding the second cycle until the dump has been read back so the guest
    (whose PASS is the *third* frame region the app creates) outlives it. The
    assertion is that a strip of the work area only a maximised window can
    cover is not the wallpaper: a window that came back transparent would leave
    it wallpaper, and no cascaded terminal reaches it.
  - **Two prerequisites the script cannot reconstruct without.** The gallery's
    declared window extent (`WIN_WIDTH` / `WIN_HEIGHT` / its `WindowSizing`)
    is private to its `Run` binary, so a host reconstruction cannot read the
    one definition and would have to restate it; hoist those into the crate's
    `lib` as `lib/browse` already does for the file manager. And the clamp that
    turns a declared extent into a client size lives on
    `tairix_window::Desktop`, which is built from a `DesktopInfo` — the host
    needs one composed from the board geometry rather than a second copy of
    `Desktop::window_size`'s arithmetic.
  - **What remains genuinely unwitnessed even then.** That the *pages* were
    freed, rather than merely unmapped on both sides. The sysinfo memory
    reading could show free memory rising across the release, but it is noisy
    on a live desktop; the honest witness is the release record plus the
    re-attach, and the page accounting belongs to a kernel-side test of
    `shm_unmap` refcounting rather than to a desktop vertical.
- **D56 — the page tables were reachable only through an identity map —
  DONE**, so every page table, and the direct map that shared the window
  with them, had to live below the user virtual base. Surfaced by D55, which
  removed the smaller of the two bounds; not introduced by it. The walk half
  is closed on every port — each recovers a table through its frame source —
  and so is the placement half: x86_64 has a kernel-half direct map reaching
  127 TiB, riscv64 191 GiB in Sv39's upper half, and aarch64 447 GiB in a
  `TTBR1_EL1` regime the architecture keeps disjoint from user space. No
  process root on any port carries a full-RAM identity map.
- **D55 — the x86_64 direct physical map covered only the first gigabyte —
  DONE.** Every kernel path that reaches a frame by pointer — the spawn image
  write, the shared-memory scrub, the remap window's own record store, the
  kernel heap's slab page supply — failed closed for a frame above it, and
  the allocator hands out its highest frames first, so on a machine with more
  RAM the first frame drawn was already unreachable. The port now sizes one
  identity map from the boot memory map, as its siblings do. Two defects fell
  out of it (a huge leaf dereferenced as a page table, and a RAM self-test
  that silently skipped what the map did not cover).
- **D49 — a QEMU vertical's success status is also what a machine reset
  produces**, on aarch64 and riscv64 (both report success as plain `0`). The
  harness's verdict is therefore fail-open: a guest that took the machine down
  without reaching its assertions scores `Pass`. Latent today (no enrolment
  resets its guest) and confirmed by measurement, not inference.
- **D45 — the per-CPU live-space publication accepted a non-`Arc` pointer —
  DONE.** Its `Arc` refcount write therefore landed out of bounds, corrupting
  the host heap and failing the §7 gate's test phase. It was a real unsound
  `unsafe` write, not test isolation: the `Arc` provenance is now a type
  invariant. Two further defects fell out of it (a dispatch refusal that left
  stale per-CPU publications, and a futex bucket table swapped under live keys).
- **D5 — `mem-pin-migration` intermittent multi-vCPU-TCG stall — DONE.**
  Root-caused to a lost-wakeup in the vertical's own secondary-CPU idle
  loop and fixed structurally (not a load artifact, not a budget bump).
- **D6 — `docs-check` cross-crate resolution failure — DONE.** A
  `docs-check` build failing to resolve real, unconditional `pub` items in
  sibling crates. The cause is a **poisoned build cache**: a `cargo` build
  killed mid-flight leaves truncated zero-byte rmeta that the next build's
  fingerprints accept as fresh. Not a rustdoc or mergeable-info defect — the
  errors come from *rustc* checking a dependent crate. The diagnostic recipe
  and the one contingency that would still make it a real doc-build defect
  are kept in its section.
- **D10 — `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` intermittent terminal-focus
  freeze — DONE.** The QEMU vertical intermittently timed out at the AW4
  terminal stage. Root cause was a fragile *test-harness* readiness gate
  (the terminal-window click keyed on a global window-endpoint
  `CallReplied` count that also counts window *presents*), not a kernel
  lost-wakeup: a timing-dependent files-window repaint inflated the count
  and fired the terminal-focus click before the terminal window existed.
  Fixed by gating on window *creation* (the once-per-window shared-frame
  `sc=shm_map`), which no repaint can inflate; a host regression test
  locks the creation-based gate in. (D7–D9 below are already-closed
  x86_64 defects.)
- **D11 — `netstack-listener-qemu-aarch64` RTO-cadence crawl — DONE.** The
  QEMU vertical intermittently (~1/3 of runs) timed out (300s): the single-CPU
  guest went **fully idle** (guest clock frozen) for a full TCP-RTO interval
  and only progressed when the host's retransmit raised a device IRQ. Root
  cause was **depth-1 transmit staging** in `lib/virtio_net` (candidate (b),
  not a scheduler lost-wakeup): each `service()` handed the device only one
  frame and stranded the ACK queued behind a data segment in the frame ring
  until an interrupt-driven re-service, so the transfer drained at the
  completion-interrupt/RTO cadence. Fixed by multi-in-flight TX pipelining (a
  fixed `TxStaging` pool sized to the transmit ring: reap-all + stage-all per
  `service`, head-keyed completion reclaim), with two host regression tests.
- **D12 — aarch64 GICv2 SGI end-of-interrupt dropped the source-CPU field
  — DONE.** Under IPI-heavy load (`stress --cpu 12`, and the earlier
  `--vm` reproductions) every CPU hard-locked with IRQ *unmasked* yet no
  interrupt delivered and a merely-*pending* stuck line. Root cause:
  `gic::acknowledge` masked the `GICC_IAR` value with `IAR_INTID_MASK`
  before `handle_irq` passed it to `GICC_EOIR`, discarding the SGI
  source-CPU field (bits [12:10]). The GICv2 spec requires an SGI's EOIR
  write to carry the same source-CPU bits read from IAR, so a reschedule
  IPI (SGI 0) sent from any CPU other than 0 was **never deactivated**:
  the CPU-interface running priority stayed raised and every further
  interrupt on that core (preemption timer, watchdog, devices) was
  blocked, wedging it. It presented as an undiagnosable "hard lockup" only
  because the never-EOI'd interrupt is a *banked* SGI, invisible to the
  observer's SPI-only `stuck_spi` scan. Fixed by carrying the full IAR
  value through acknowledge → dispatch (masking only for the INTID
  comparison) → EOI, so the source-CPU field survives to the completion
  write; host regression tests lock the full-IAR return and the
  source-CPU-preserving EOIR write in.
- **D13 — a distinct secondary-CPU hard lockup under `stress --cpu 20` —
  DONE.** On the (D12-fixed) debug image a secondary core wedged inside an
  IRQ-masked EL1 section, so the maskable liveness sample could only report a
  bare hard lockup. Root cause: the kernel heap allocator guarded its state
  with a plain `AtomicBool` spinlock that never masked interrupts, so an
  interrupt taken on a CPU already holding it whose handler allocated
  re-entered `alloc` and spun forever on its own mainline's lock — a
  single-CPU self-deadlock, unsampleable because exception entry masks
  interrupts. Fixed by `tairix_kalloc`'s crate-global interrupt-control seam
  (each port installs its primitive at `boot()`, before any secondary
  starts). The Pi 4 *boot* wedge this defect also chased was D81; the QEMU
  stress vertical's own early-boot silence was D84. `stress --cpu 20` no
  longer wedges on metal. The masked-section samplers built to chase it (FIQ
  self-sample, CoreSight `EDPCSR`) stay as standing observers for any future
  wedge.
- **D14 — `sysmon-qemu-aarch64` load-dependent inactivity-budget timeout
  under concurrent `cargo xtask ci` — DONE.** The single-CPU, full-boot
  `sysmon` acceptance vertical timed out only when the gate ran it alongside
  its ~dozen other QEMU guests: the matrix admitted one guest per host
  logical CPU, so co-scheduled single-CPU TCG guests starved each other of
  throughput until this work-heavy one fell silent for its whole 120 s.
  Fixed structurally — not a retry and not a budget bump — by the weighted
  QEMU concurrency budget (`qemu_host_budget_for`): the matrix admits
  in-flight guests up to **one third** of the host's logical CPUs, charging a
  uniprocessor guest two units and an SMP guest the whole budget so an SMP
  guest runs alone. The deliberate headroom reflects a guest costing far more
  than its lone vCPU thread (translation, RCU/main-loop and I/O threads, its
  own in-guest watchdogs). Because the per-guest deadline is an *inactivity*
  budget that serial output resets, a guest that runs slower co-scheduled is
  never mistaken for a hung one. Raising the budget is a timing change to be
  validated on the soak host, never from one green developer run.

- **D44 — a console reader's re-park used the CPU id it remembered before its
  first park, suspending whichever task now ran there — DONE.** `elsh` was
  killed for a fault it never took. Root-caused to a stale per-CPU index in
  `BlockingConsoleRead::read_until`, which read the CPU once before its
  poll-and-park loop; fixed by reading it at each park, plus a fail-closed
  dispatcher check that a suspension point lies on the task's own kernel stack.
  See the full entry below.

- **D15 — `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` freeze at the PTY Ctrl-C stage,
  timing-perturbable by an unrelated binary-size change — OPEN (for the
  PTY owner).** While landing the RFC 3168 TCP ECN engine (`plans/NETWORK.md`
  N13 — pure `lib/net`/`netstack` changes, nothing on the terminal/pty/
  shell/signal path, `enable_ecn` off by default so netstack behaviour is
  byte-identical), this vertical began freezing at the **AW4 PTY Ctrl-C
  job-control sub-stage** (`plans/PTY.md`): the guest emits `PTY ctrl-c
  armed`, spawns the recovery tasks, then the single CPU stops advancing
  (~60 s guest-time) with **no** kernel WARN/ERROR/panic/OOM — the desktop's
  own IPC loop stops too. A/B confirmed: with the ECN change the vertical
  freezes 4/4 runs (300 s **and** an 1800 s budget — a real freeze, not
  slowness); with the ECN change `git stash`ed it **passes**. Because ECN
  cannot reach the pty path, the correlation is a **timing perturbation**
  (the slightly larger `netstack`/driver binaries shift load/spawn timing),
  which points at a **D10-class fragile test-harness readiness gate** in the
  Ctrl-C stage — the same failure mode D10 fixed for the terminal-focus
  click (a gate keyed on a global window-endpoint `CallReplied`/occurrence
  count rather than a monotonic creation event). D10 fixed the terminal
  *focus* gate but the newer PTY Ctrl-C sub-stage appears to carry the same
  fragility. The ECN change is otherwise fully green (host tests,
  integration, `fuzz --secs 5`, clippy `-D warnings`, docs, fmt) and was
  accepted with this recorded for the PTY owner. Recommended fix
  (structural, per §7/§2.17): re-gate the Ctrl-C stage on a monotonic,
  count-independent readiness marker (as D10 did with `sc=shm_map` window
  creation), **not** a timeout bump or retry; reproduce with
  `cargo xtask test --qemu --only autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` on this
  branch. The subsequent RFC 8511 ABE change (`plans/NETWORK.md` N13,
  `lib/net::tcp::cc`) reproduces the identical freeze for the identical
  reason — a few added `lib/net` constants/helpers shift the same load/spawn
  timing; ABE cannot reach the pty path (`enable_ecn` off, `on_ecn`
  unreachable without a negotiated-ECN connection) — and was likewise
  accepted with this recorded for the PTY owner. The subsequent DHCPv4
  D2 change (`plans/DHCP.md` — the `lib/net::Stack`/`netstack` interface
  integration of the DHCP client) reproduces the identical 300 s timeout at
  the same PTY Ctrl-C stage (the last bundle of the store scan loaded — the
  transcripts name `viewer.app`, since deleted — desktop still pumping, no
  WARN/panic/OOM) for the identical reason — a few added `lib/net`/`netstack`
  bytes shift the same load/spawn timing; DHCP cannot reach the pty path — and
  was likewise accepted (User-confirmed) with this recorded for the PTY owner.
  The subsequent DHCPv6 D4a change (`plans/DHCP.md` — the pure
  `lib/net::dhcpv6` RFC 8415 client engine) reproduces the identical 300 s
  timeout at the same stage (the store scan's last bundle loaded ~87 s
  guest-time, desktop still pumping IPC, no WARN/panic/OOM) for the identical reason — the new
  `lib/net` module adds compiled bytes that shift the same load/spawn
  timing; DHCPv6 is inert at runtime here (D4a is engine-only, no netstack
  wiring) so it cannot reach the pty path — and was likewise recorded for
  the PTY owner. The subsequent DHCPv6 **D4c** change (`plans/DHCP.md` — the
  live two-process QEMU verticals; production `lib/net`/`netstack` untouched,
  all new code test-only in `netpeer`/`netstack_wire`/the three `dhcp6` test
  crates) reproduces the identical 300 s PTY-Ctrl-C-stage freeze for the
  identical reason and is likewise recorded for the PTY owner. That increment
  *did* land part of the §7/§2.17 structural recommendation — it bound the QEMU
  matrix concurrency harder (`qemu_host_budget_for`: one-quarter → one-**sixth**
  of logical CPUs) so co-scheduled single-CPU TCG guests get more host headroom;
  that rescued the new heavier `netstack-dhcp6-qemu-aarch64` full-boot vertical
  (which had briefly tripped a load-dependent 240 s timeout, now a 360 s budget
  sized to DHCPv6's larger work), but this desktop/PTY vertical still freezes on
  the D10-class readiness gate above, which only the marker re-gate will fix.
  Any small binary-size change is expected to keep tripping this gate until that
  structural fix lands. The subsequent DNS **DNS1** change (`plans/DNS.md` — the
  pure `lib/net::dns` RFC 1035/RFC 5452 stub-resolver engine, engine-only with no
  netstack wiring) reproduces the identical 300 s PTY-Ctrl-C-stage freeze for the
  identical reason — the new `lib/net` module adds compiled bytes that shift the
  same load/spawn timing, and DNS is inert at runtime here so it cannot reach the
  pty path — and was likewise accepted (User-confirmed) with this recorded for the
  PTY owner.

- **D16 — Raspberry Pi 4 near-every-boot hard lockup ~10 s after USB-HID
  bring-up — DONE.** On real BCM2711 (never QEMU, which uses virtio and a
  coherent I-cache) the boot wedged a core with interrupts masked shortly
  after the USB keyboard/mouse drivers loaded; the lockup watchdog reported
  a bare `context=kernel sampled=pre_silence k_site=user_switch
  k_detail=0x0e` (task 14, a `usb_kbd` EL0 driver) with no fault/syscall
  breadcrumb. Root-caused (on-metal beacons, then `objdump`) to **two**
  distinct metal-only defects, both fixed:
  1. **Missing I-cache maintenance after the loader writes a program's code
     pages.** `kernel/mem` `build_process_image` fills code through the
     cacheable direct map; the Cortex-A72 I-cache is not coherent with those
     writes, so a freshly-loaded driver fetched stale/garbage instructions
     and took an `EC=0` "unknown/unallocated instruction" abort on valid
     code (non-deterministic per physical frame — "always after USB" = the
     last-loaded drivers). Fix: a no-default `PhysMap::sync_instruction_cache`
     (aarch64 `dc cvau`+`dsb ish`+`ic ivau`+`dsb ish`+`isb`; coherent/host
     impls a documented no-op), called by the loader for `MapFlags::EXEC`
     segments only. The maintenance lives on `ConfiguredPhysMap`
     (the aarch64 physmap that carries the arch cache primitives), and **both
     aarch64 spawn producers — PID 1 `init_spawn.rs` and the runtime `spawn`
     `spawn_producer.rs` — load through it**; a `DirectPhysMap` (whose
     `sync_instruction_cache`/`clean_invalidate` are the I/O-coherent no-op)
     threaded into either loader silently defeats the guarantee and reproduces
     the fault as a `write=false fault_class=wild` data abort (the stale bytes
     now decode to a valid-but-wrong instruction that loads through a wild
     pointer) — the terminate path (fix 2) then kills the driver instead of
     halting, so the keyboard never comes up. The stored `BuiltImage.physmap`
     is the same map, so its `clean_invalidate` (the shared-memory zero-on-free
     scrub) is real on the Pi too. Regression coverage: the `kernel/mem` loader
     test proves `sync_instruction_cache` is called for EXEC segments only; the
     wiring is single-sourced (both loaders name `ConfiguredPhysMap`)
     and metal-only (QEMU `virt` is I-cache-coherent, so no host/QEMU vertical
     can exercise it — like fix 2 it is confirmed on metal).
  2. **The trap handler parked the whole CPU on that user exception.** An
     EL0 sync exception the specific handlers did not resolve (the `EC=0`
     here) fell through to `halt_current_cpu()` (`msr DAIFSet,#0xf` + `wfi`
     forever) — a one-task fault escalated to a system-wide hard lockup.
     Fix (§17.1/§2.9/§26.5): a shared `fatal_exception` that, for any
     lower-EL (`kind >= LOWER_SYNC`) exception, **terminates the offending
     task and keeps the CPU alive** via a new resolution-free
     `DispatchHook::terminate_user_fault` + aarch64 `UserFaultTerminateFn`;
     only a same-EL kernel fault or an unattributable one halts. Regression
     tests: the loader syncs code (and only code); the terminate path never
     returns "retry".

- **D17 — riscv64 loader has no instruction-cache maintenance for
  freshly-loaded code — OPEN (latent, real-hardware only).** Noticed while
  fixing D16's aarch64 wiring: the riscv64 spawn producers
  (`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/riscv64/{spawn_producer,init_spawn}.rs`) fill and
  map code through `DirectPhysMap`, whose `sync_instruction_cache` is the
  no-op, and RISC-V has **no** `ConfiguredPhysMap` equivalent — there
  is no `FENCE.I` maintenance anywhere on the load path. RISC-V instruction
  fetch is not required to be coherent with stores, so a real SiFive board can
  fetch stale code exactly as the Pi 4 did (D16). It does not reproduce on the
  QEMU `virt` target (TCG invalidates its translation cache on writes), so no
  vertical catches it. The proper fix is an Arch-HAL `sync_instruction_cache`
  slice for riscv64 (a `FENCE.I` broadcast to the executing harts, cross-hart
  via IPI) plus a riscv64 physmap that carries it, threaded into both riscv64
  spawn loaders — the same shape as the aarch64 fix, not a copy (§2.21). Left
  as a separate item because it is an Arch-HAL addition, not the reported
  aarch64 boot fault, and riscv64 metal is not the platform in play; it must
  not ship to real riscv hardware unfixed.

- **D18 — early-boot silent guest death when PID 1 spawns a 5th concurrent
  boot service — DONE (non-reproducing; superseded by FONT-SERVICE).** The
  original report was a silent aarch64 guest death ~2.5 s into boot when a 5th
  `service` was added to init's `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, attributed to a
  concurrency/capacity defect in the early-boot spawn path. It **no longer
  reproduces** on the current tree, and the feared silent-corruption path does
  not exist:
  - **Root cause was the per-app font payload, now removed.** Before
    FONT-SERVICE each GUI/service `Run` carried a ~10 MB `R` segment, so a 5th
    near-simultaneous address-space build during root-mount was genuinely heavy
    (page-table / RAM pressure at the tests' 256 MiB) — that weight, not the
    service *count*, was the trigger. FONT-SERVICE removed the payload
    (`fontd` rasterises on demand), so every early service is now slim.
  - **The spawn path is robust and fails closed.** Controlled aarch64
    `spawn-session` experiments (isolated): all 6 early processes
    (`sysinfod`→`netstack`→`devmgr`→`seatmgr`→`fontd`→`login`) spawn and the
    guest reaches login cleanly; a stress run of **10** concurrent boot
    services (crash-looping duplicates → heavy spawn churn) booted healthily to
    the 120 s harness timeout with **19** process-spawns, login serving IPC,
    and **no** panic/fault/guard-violation/corruption. The kthread-stack guard
    arena is ample (~60 stacks in the 4 MiB boot arena at 256 MiB) and its
    growth is implemented and fail-closed (chain-a-block via `FrameArenaGrow`,
    else the software-canary `BoxStack`); the startup-config parser fails
    closed at `> MAX_SERVICES` (`ConfigError::TooManyServices`). There is no
    silent overflow. `startup::MAX_SERVICES` is now *derived* from the
    boot floor (`DEFAULT_CONFIG`'s own `service`-directive count) rather than
    a magic `4`, so the floor can never overrun its own bound
    (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-1).
  - **Standing regression coverage (no new vertical — §2.2/§2.3).** Concurrent
    early-boot service bring-up during root-mount is exercised by
    `spawn_session_qemu_*` (4 services + session); EL0 multitasking under the
    live scheduler by `spawn_el0_timeshare_qemu_*` and `scheduler_stress_qemu`;
    guard-arena growth/fail-closed by the `stack_arena` host tests
    (`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/stack_arena_tests.rs`). SVC-A has since moved
    PID 1 onto the heap-backed `Init` engine (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md`),
    so the services are no longer bounded by a no-heap `const`; only the
    per-console session table (`supervisor::MAX_SUPERVISED_CONSOLES`) remains a
    fixed stack bound, and the growable discovery-registered service tier lands
    with its own N-service guard on the `lib/rt` heap (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5b).

- **D19 / D20 — `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` terminal + post-terminal
  sequencing drift — CLOSED (green).** The vertical was RED because its
  post-terminal stages were sequenced on **cumulative `MessageDelivered`
  counts** that the FONT-SERVICE cadence change drifted, firing the
  file-manager clicks early, hijacking focus off the terminal, and stalling
  the run (surfacing as a 300 s timeout). Resolution:
  - The terminal → pty stage now sequences on **guest readiness markers and
    uniquely-attributable witnesses**, not counts: the AW4 round-trip and the
    pty `Ctrl-C` recovery are attributed to the *bundle loads* of
    `/System/Commands/sleep.app` and `/System/Commands/true.app` (the `appmgr`
    `APP_LOADED` `bundle` field), and the typed command is gated on
    `TERMINAL_FOCUSED_MARKER` (first delivery to the second window port).
  - The FM9-a/-b/-c, FM10 and FM11 **file-manager choreography was removed
    from this vertical** (user-approved scope-down): that application UI logic
    is proven by `lib/browse`'s host unit tests, and driving it via a long,
    blind pointer-injection script only added the count-drift fragility. The
    vertical now proves what only QEMU can — driver autoload, encrypted-root
    unlock, display bind, and the keyboard → session → terminal → pty → shell
    round trip + `Ctrl-C` job control — and passes six deterministic
    witnesses. The theme-toggle `light` screendump was also dropped: it is a
    WM feature orthogonal to this vertical, and it was never content-verified
    green (the toggle did not present a light frame; tracked below).
  - **Follow-up (not blocking):** in the QEMU desktop the appearance-toggle
    click did not produce a light-theme frame (the `window` and `light`
    screendumps were byte-identical). The theme-toggle *logic* is host-tested
    in `tairix_desktop_session`/`tairix_taskbar`; whether the QEMU gap is a
    click-choreography artefact or a real present path issue is unresolved and
    left for a compositor/display vertical to investigate.

- **D21 — a layered block device republishes an unreadable member class as
  `Virtual`, so the mount table can report a medium nobody declared — OPEN
  (structural fix staged).** The block-service publish site wraps the
  *served* class in `Some(...)` (`lib/abi/src/blkio.rs` `serve`:
  `let class = Some(device.device_class());`), and `Block::device_class()` is
  concrete by definition — its trait default is `BlkDeviceClass::Virtual` —
  so a layer over a device whose class word was unreadable publishes
  `Some(Virtual)`, a fabricated identity indistinguishable from a genuine
  paravirtual device. That now reaches userland: the mount medium threads
  from the completion through `MountBacking` to
  `MountRecord::medium()`, so the System Information API can assert a medium
  no driver reported. Noticed while landing that mount-medium path (which
  fixed the *decode* half: an undefined class word stays `None` end to end),
  recorded here rather than fixed inline because the remaining half widens
  the block trait across every implementor. Detail below.
- **D22 — `netstack-dhcp-qemu-riscv64` intermittent stall under the full
  pipeline — DONE.** Not load: the in-kernel virtio completion wait had no
  deadline, so one unobserved completion parked the boot task inside a disk
  request holding that disk's lock, behind which `/System`'s mount and the
  driver-store service sit. Every park now carries the caller's deadline and
  `virtio_blk` fails a silent request closed; the 360 s budget is unchanged.
  See the section.
- **D23 — the debug FIQ self-sample corrupted the aarch64 exception-return
  window — DONE.** A desktop session on the QEMU-`virt` **debug** image hard
  locked a secondary core with a `pre_silence` PC *inside* the trap
  trampoline's return epilogue. That epilogue programmed the single-copy
  `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1` pair ~40 instructions before its `eret`; the debug
  watchdog's Group-0/FIQ cadence — the one asynchronous exception that can
  land there — overwrote both, so the interrupted `eret` re-entered the
  epilogue at EL1 with its frame popped and climbed `sp` off the kernel
  stack into a recursive, `DAIF`-masked abort storm: silent, no panic, no
  recovery. Both `eret` sequences now mask asynchronous exceptions before
  they program the return state. Detail below.
- **D24 — in-kernel work had no yield boundary, so a burst of fast device
  operations monopolised a core — DONE.** A desktop session on the QEMU-`virt`
  debug image reported a 10 s soft lockup (`id=4080 cpu=0 stalled_ms=10000
  context=kernel`) while an app decoded wallpaper JPEGs and a second app wanted
  the CPU. The report was honest, not a false positive: the sample's
  `context=kernel` comes straight from `SPSR_EL1`, and its backtrace resolved
  through the storage stack (`SharedBlockHandle::read_blocks` →
  `BlockCache::cached_read` → `virtio_blk` → `notify_wait`). Root cause was a
  **missing boundary, not a spin**: both preemption latches are consumed only on
  the way back to user mode, so an in-kernel body that issues one bounded
  operation after another holds its CPU for the whole burst whenever the device
  is fast enough that no operation has to wait — `virtio_blk::submit_and_wait`
  polls the ring *before* waiting, and under QEMU the completion is already
  there, so the park that would have returned control to the dispatcher never
  happens. The dispatch loop's housekeeping and heartbeats stopped for the
  burst, which is exactly the condition `classify` reports. Fixed by giving
  in-kernel code the boundary it lacked (`preempt::yield_if_owed`, sharing one
  `honour_latched_tick` decision with the return-to-user point), called from the
  storage funnel every in-kernel device operation passes through
  (`SharedBlockHandle::with_device`, before the device lock is taken) and from
  the in-kernel `/System` store server's between-requests boundary. The
  diagnostic that misdirected the reading is fixed too: a kernel kthread body
  now stamps `k_site=kernel_body` instead of sharing `user_switch` with a real
  user task's EL0 run.
- **D33 — `waitset_wait` fixed-priority starvation — DONE.** A
  level-triggered member with work outstanding held the scan head, so a
  server handling one source per wake served nothing else. The registry now
  rotates the scan past the member each wait reported.
- **D34 — the tray monitor exited on session back-pressure — DONE.** A full
  session queue (`WouldBlock`) counted as a publish fault, so five busy
  sample periods killed the monitor; nothing restarts one. Back-pressure is
  now excluded from the give-up budget.
- **D35 — an app-ward window event was dropped when its mailbox was full —
  DONE.** The session's delivery was one non-blocking send with no hold-back,
  so a state edge (`Resized`, `FilePicked`, …) could be lost. The session now
  holds back what a full mailbox refuses, in order and folded by kind, and
  flushes it when the level-triggered `WaitSourceKind::PortRoom` member
  reports room; see the section.
- **D152 — a panic *inside* the framebuffer console's renderer hangs its own
  report (OPEN).** Noticed while wiring the D8 surface handover
  (`plans/DISPLAY.md`), not caused by it. On an aarch64 release build with a
  live framebuffer, `SerialSink::write_event` renders the record through
  `video::write_bytes`, whose shared `paint` body takes `RENDER_LOCK`
  **blocking**. A panic raised while that lock is already held by this CPU —
  an index or arithmetic fault inside `lib/fbcon`, or inside `paint` itself —
  therefore deadlocks on the report it is trying to emit: no oops on the
  screen, no oops on serial, a silent hang. The re-entrancy guard does not
  help (it does not release the lock). D8's panic reclaim deliberately steps
  around this (`video::reclaim_surface` uses `try_lock` precisely so it cannot
  add a second hang site) but does **not** fix the underlying write path. The
  real fix is Linux's `bust_spinlocks` shape: on entry to the panic path, mark
  the console locks broken so every later console write proceeds unlocked —
  the machine is going down and a torn frame beats silence. Needs a `lib/sync`
  primitive for "abandon this lock", so it is a `lib/sync` + per-port change,
  not a one-liner. **Regression cover owed with the fix** (§7): a host test
  that panics with the render lock held and asserts the record still reaches
  the sink.
- **D25 — `boot_audit_ring`'s scripted test clock was process-wide, making its
  exact-instant assertions order-dependent — DONE.** Noticed while running the
  `kernel/core` suite for D24: `records_are_retained_and_read_non_destructively`
  read back `8 s` where it expected `1 s`. The module's `scripted_clock` counted
  on one `static AtomicU64` that several tests `reset_clock()` before asserting
  the exact instants their own writes recorded, and the harness runs those tests
  in parallel threads — so a sibling test's reads advanced the sequence between
  a test's reset and its own writes. Fixed structurally by making the counter
  per-thread (`std::thread_local!`), so a test's scripted sequence is its own;
  a regression test asserts the per-thread independence directly (it fails
  against a shared counter). Not a load artifact and not retried away: six
  consecutive whole-crate runs are green.
- **D37 — riscv64 saved no floating-point state, and FP was enabled — DONE.**
  Noticed by reading the port, confirmed by measurement (`sstatus.FS = Dirty`
  from OpenSBI with no `fsd`/`fld` anywhere), and fixed with lazy per-task state
  carried in the task's own trap anchor: FP starts off so a non-FP task pays
  nothing, the first use traps and adopts a zeroed file, a trap saves only a
  dirty one, and the kernel computes in floating point itself under
  round-to-nearest. Witness: `fp_isolation_qemu_riscv64`, two tasks whose
  patterns must not mix.

- **D38 — the nightly soak killed every filesystem soak, and a memtest
  sweep mid-progress — DONE.** Three wall-clock defects in the soak
  tooling: an `fssoak` child given an ordinary step's 45-minute deadline
  while being told to run for seven hours (so any budget above 45 minutes
  was unreachable by construction), a soak loop that always started one
  pass more than fitted its budget, and a memtest-takeover guest killed
  by a ceiling derived from a silence budget that describes no part of a
  whole-RAM sweep. All fixed structurally, none by a retry. These are
  *ceiling* fixes; an inactivity-budget starvation is a different bound and
  was D14's, closed by the weighted QEMU concurrency budget.
- **D39 — a riscv64 guest stalled dead moments after a `spawn` — DONE.**
  `userentry::enter_user_mode` armed `sscratch` — which the trap vector reads
  as "this trap came from U-mode" — with `sstatus.SIE` still set, so an
  interrupt in the two instructions before its `sret` was misclassified,
  clobbered the caller's frame and returned down the S-mode path, which does
  not re-arm. The new process then ran with no kernel stack armed and every
  later trap built its frame on the task's own *user* stack until the program
  wild-jumped — and a U-mode instruction page fault halted the hart, silencing
  the guest. `SIE` now joins the mask cleared ahead of the arm, as aarch64
  has always done. The silence was a second defect: riscv64 offered only
  load/store U-mode page faults to the resolver and halted on everything
  else, so any user program's wild jump could park the machine. It now has
  aarch64's `UserFaultTerminateFn` and kills the task instead.
- **D40 — a mutating memory syscall re-froze the whole address space —
  DONE.** Every syscall or fault that changed a task's mappings rebuilt the
  registry's whole snapshot: a page-table walk plus a heap node per resident
  page, inside one non-preemptible call. The release half was fixed earlier
  (`mem_unmap`); the mapping half was staged and underrated, because the
  desktop session maps a frame region for **every window an app opens** — a
  `terminal.app` context menu paid four of them against the largest address
  space on the machine, the ~300 ms per menu reported on a Pi 4B. Each path
  now publishes only its own region's pages. Reading the same class found two
  more: a file-backed fault re-froze per page (O(N²) to read an N-page
  mapping) and stack growth re-froze a range it had just computed.
- **D42 — an x86_64 ring-3 wild jump halted the CPU instead of the task —
  FIXED.** Found by inspection while fixing D39's sibling half: the `#PF`
  dispatcher offered a ring-3 fault to the resolver only for *data*
  accesses, so an instruction fetch reached no resolver and parked the CPU.
  The ring-3 arm now splits by who owns the fault rather than by whether it
  can be resolved, and charges everything the resolver does not own to the
  D86 terminator.
- **D43 — a riscv64 U-mode task could steer the kernel onto another hart's
  per-CPU state — DONE.** Found by inspection while designing per-thread
  thread-local storage. `tp` (x4) is both the psABI thread pointer U-mode
  writes freely and this port's per-hart kernel identity anchor
  (`SchedulerArch::current_cpu` → `smp::current_hartid` reads it), and the
  trap vector never touched it — so `li tp, <other hart>; ecall` had the
  kernel resolve *that* core's resume handle, dispatch slot, and live address
  space. `sscratch` now points at a per-task 16-byte **trap anchor** carrying
  the running hart's kernel `tp`; the from-U prologue spills the user's `tp`
  into the frame and reloads the kernel's before any other register is
  touched, and the U-return path publishes the current hart's value (so a
  migrated task re-enters U-mode under the right identity) and restores the
  user's. The frame slot lives on the task's own kernel stack, so the thread
  pointer is now genuinely per-task — the platform contract TLS rests on.
  Witness: `tests/integration/tp_isolation_qemu_riscv64` (a hostile-`tp`
  U-mode fixture on a two-CPU guest), plus the `trap_layout_tests.rs`
  ordering/layout pinning against `trap.s`.
- **D47 — every desktop launch lost its first argument, so the autostarted
  file manager ran as an ordinary window — DONE.** `appbar-qemu-aarch64` ran
  to its 600s ceiling. `spawn_app` passed the caller's arguments as the whole
  argv, so the program name a program's own arguments begin *after* was its
  first real argument: the file-manager autostart never saw `--desktop` and
  took `Role::Window` — an unasked-for home window at every login and a
  *Quit* row on a core component. The rule is now the one host-tested
  `launch_argv`. The harness half compounded it: the autostarted file manager
  holds strip slot 0, so measuring "the launched application" there compared
  it with itself; the script now drives `APPBAR_LAUNCHED_SLOT`.
- **D48 — a window `Create` an app could build but the session had to refuse,
  and nothing said so — DONE.** `datetime.app` asked for a fixed-size window
  *and* a minimum client size; the protocol refuses that pair, so the app
  exited before it ever drew. `WindowSizing` is now a sum type, so the
  combination cannot be spelled. Its second half was the silence: the elevated
  child's `stderr` is login's console, invisible behind the desktop, so login
  now audits an abnormal exit (`LAUNCH_ENDED_ABNORMALLY`) naming the reason.

These are **distinct in kind**: D1 finishes an interrupt-model fix, D2
and D4 are §27 foundational-completeness defects, D3 is an Arch-HAL
parity gap, D5 was a test-harness idle-loop lost-wakeup (fixed), D6 was a
docs-build resolution failure root-caused to a poisoned build cache
(closed), D10 was a fragile QEMU-harness
readiness gate (fixed), D18 was an early-boot concurrent-spawn scare that
proved non-reproducing once FONT-SERVICE removed the per-app font payload
(closed), D19/D20 were the `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` count-drift
(closed: marker-based sequencing + file-manager choreography moved to host
tests), D21 is an ABI-honesty gap — a layer asserting a hardware fact nobody
reported — D22 was an unbounded in-kernel virtio completion wait that
parked the boot task inside a disk request while holding that disk's lock
(fixed), D23 was an observer-perturbs-the-observed defect the debug
watchdog's own non-maskable sample exposed (fixed), D42/D86 were the x86_64
halves of the fatal-user-exception routing D39 closed for riscv64 (fixed),
D24 was a
missing in-kernel preemption boundary — a fairness defect, not a wedge — that
let a burst of never-waiting device operations withhold a core (fixed), D25
was a process-wide test clock that made a host suite's exact-instant assertions
order-dependent (fixed), D36 was a shared stroke path that never converged,
so one graph reading spun a core inside the monitor's own process (fixed),
D37 was a
per-port context-switch gap found by reading rather than by a failure — the
riscv64 floating-point file was never switched while firmware left it enabled
(fixed), and D43 was a privilege-boundary defect of the same
found-by-reading kind as D42 — a user-writable register the kernel trusted for
its own per-CPU identity (fixed), D47 was a dropped argv[0] in the desktop's
launch path that started a core component in the wrong role, behind a harness
that measured the wrong slot (fixed), and D48 was a window request an app could
build but the protocol had to refuse, dying in silence because a graphical
elevation's `stderr` reaches no one (fixed), and D52 was an x86_64 cross-CPU
shootdown protocol defect that only became reachable once a production caller
existed — the tree was safe by the current caller set, not by the protocol
(fixed: the protocol no longer asks callers for anything), D57/D58/D59 were a *policy* group rather than coding slips — a
pressure model whose two halves disagreed, three counts standing in for the
resource they were meant to bound, and a release that undid itself one line
later and then only ran on an edge nobody crosses (all fixed) — and D60 is the
coverage those three left behind: a path tested at every seam and never once
end to end, which is exactly the shape that let D59's three halves hide behind
green unit tests (open; its design is corrected and its groundwork landed with
D59's third half). D61/D62 are the two stream-wake defects that had been filed
under numbers D52 and D53 already held by the shootdown and kernel-heap
entries; the citations in the tree now resolve to one defect each. Do not
collapse the open items into one change; land each on its own
whole-project-green gate (§7). D63 and D64 are the two defects here that are
*not* kernel defects, tracked here for their severity, and both are now fixed:
an ARXFS commit published its superblock slot with no durability barrier, so a
reordering device could lose an interior tree node beneath a durable root and
the volume would not mount (fixed in `plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` WB1, where the
batching that makes a per-commit barrier affordable landed with it, along with
three further ordering defects the work exposed); and ARXFS scrub's metadata
copy-repair wrote to the device with no read-only guard, so a mount held
read-only precisely because its medium must not be touched was written anyway
(fixed — the copy-repair is one read-only-aware rule, and reading that code
found two more read-only writes on the same path). D65 joined them and is now
fixed: ARXFS's B-tree insert recursed 8 KiB of stack per tree level,
overflowing a release kernel's 32 KiB stack — measured at 48 KiB for one write
to a fragmented file, and 34 KiB for one to a single-leaf tree, so it was
reachable without any depth at all (item A1 of
`plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`; the mutation path is iterative and the
measured cost no longer scales with depth). D66 is the fourth and is also
fixed: one `DriverError` value spoke for a taken name, a populated directory
and a retryable transient at once, so a name taken between the VFS's
pre-check and the driver call was reported as an I/O error, and any consumer
reaching a filesystem driver without the VFS's per-operation mapping read
`EWOULDBLOCK` where `EEXIST` was meant.
- **D77 — the desktop session panicked inside `alloc` under the 32-window
  pressure soak — FIXED.** `desktop-pressure-qemu-aarch64` failed
  intermittently when the session process died after 31 of its 32 windows
  were on screen (one run at the 606 s ceiling, the next green in 148 s), so
  the guest's verdict was never reached. The panic record's
  `library/alloc/…` location was `raw_vec`'s allocation abort: the request
  was `975,840` bytes from `comm=desktop`, and 975,840 = 642 × 380 × 4, one
  decorated terminal window's *outer* rectangle at the vertical's 1024×768
  screen (80×25 cells of an 8×14 face, plus the 1-pixel band and 29-pixel
  title/border the theme's metrics give). Two sites allocate exactly that —
  `WindowChrome::render`'s outer-sized transient and `FrostedBackdrop::capture`
  — and a third, `window_opened`'s content surface, is the same class one
  window-border smaller.
  - **The cause was one infallible `vec!` under an API that published a
    refusal.** `Surface::filled` — reached by every `Surface::new` in the
    graphical stack — documented "the caller fails closed rather than
    panicking" while allocating `vec![fill; count]`, which aborts the process
    on exhaustion. So the `Option`/`Result` refusal every consumer already
    handled was unreachable for the one cause that actually fires, and the
    careful degradations written against it were dead prose:
    `repaint_window`'s "an exhausted machine leaves the window exactly as it
    was rather than blanking it", `content_for_present`'s "a refusal leaves
    the window showing what it was showing", `WindowChrome::render`'s "fail
    closed", `FrostedBackdrop::capture`'s "simply retains nothing", and
    `Surface::layered`'s degrade-to-plain-size arm.
  - **Fixed by one shared reservation, `tairix_util::fallible`.** Every buffer
    whose size comes from the data reserves before it fills and reports the
    refusal: `filled`/`collected` reserve exactly for a one-shot buffer,
    `grow_to` amortised for a scratch grown across uses (so repeated growth is
    not quadratic — `lib/raster`'s blur scratch, which already had this
    discipline privately, now shares the one definition), and `reserve` serves
    a buffer filled by pushing. Wired through `lib/raster` (`Surface::filled`
    and so `new`, `from_rgba8`, the scan converter's per-fill coverage row,
    `resample`'s destination, and the resample plan / row cache / accumulator),
    `userland/gui/wm` (the scan-out frame — whose two spellings are now one —
    and each baked layer buffer), and `lib/image` (the PNG defilter, raw and
    output buffers).
  - **The refused window now states the true reason.** `window_opened`
    reported `LengthOutOfRange` for both an impossible extent and an
    exhausted heap. The engine maps the client's own frame region of that
    exact geometry *before* calling the host, so the extent is proven
    representable and only the allocator can still refuse: the session
    answers `Errno::OutOfMemory`. Two new typed refusals carry the same
    distinction outward — `ResampleError::OutOfMemory` and
    `DecodeError::OutOfMemory`, each documented as a property of the machine
    rather than of the request, so the same call may be granted later. The
    parser sandbox routes the new decode refusal to its *resource* answer
    (`IconRefusal`/`WallpaperRefusal::Unrenderable`) rather than through the
    blanket `MalformedImage` its `map_err(|_| …)` would have given, so a
    picture the machine could not hold is not reported as a bad file.
  - **Regression cover.** `lib/util` proves a refused reservation is answered
    and not aborted, and that a granted one holds exactly what was asked for;
    `lib/raster` proves `Surface::new`/`filled`, `resample` and
    `Surface::resampled` return their refusal at an extent whose byte count
    cannot be reserved. Both raster tests panic in `raw_vec` against the
    pre-fix tree, which is the same abort the guest recorded.
  - **Proven on the vertical, which now fails for a different reason.** On
    the whole-project gate the session survived the full 600 s under the same
    pressure that killed it — no panic, no `code=101`, 31 windows up, the
    desktop idle in its serve loop rather than dead — and both screendumps
    were taken and asserted. The 32nd window is now *refused* instead:
    `Screen::new` (the terminal's own client-side picture,
    `Surface::new(640, 350)`) returns `None`, `open_window` states "screen
    surface refused; no window opened" and the terminal carries on. Before
    this that same allocation aborted a process — which is the whole defect.
    The vertical required all 32 windows, so it went red on the honest answer
    rather than on a corpse; D80 has since removed that count, and the run
    stops well before a refusal.
  - **What this does *not* cover, deliberately.** The allocations made
    fallible are the ones sized by *data* — image geometry, screen extent, a
    decoded payload — the megabyte-class requests a machine short of memory
    actually refuses. Small fixed-shape bookkeeping (a `Vec` of window ids, a
    layout's rect list, a title `String`) stays infallible: `alloc`'s
    collections have no fallible push, and threading a `Result` through every
    layout function to answer a 32-byte refusal would be a worse design for a
    failure the process cannot survive anyway. D79 was the churn that made the
    refusal fire in the first place, and is now gone.
  - **Two things found while diagnosing it are fixed.** A userland panic's
    reason reached only `stderr`, so a service — or a graphical session whose
    console is the screen it composites over — died leaving nothing but an
    exit status: the runtime now records the report through the system log as
    well (`tairix_rt::PANIC_REPORTED`, the `7000..8000` range `lib/rt` owns),
    allocation-free, message before location so the log's message bound
    cannot truncate away what happened. And the session's
    `EXIT_NO_PINBOARD_ENDPOINT` was `101` — `tairix_rt::EXIT_PANIC` — so a
    panic and a clean bind refusal were indistinguishable from the status; the
    runtime's code is now reserved and public, and the session's moved to
    `104`.
- **D80 — the pressure soak drove a fixed window count at a relative target,
  so its premise was load-dependent and its assertion was skipped — FIXED.**
  `desktop-pressure-qemu-aarch64` asked one terminal process for 32 windows on
  the aarch64 virt board's default RAM (`usable_bytes` 186,310,656 — about
  177 MiB). Each window retains the terminal's own `Screen` surface (896,000
  bytes at the default 640×350 grid), its shared frame region (that again,
  times `FRAME_COUNT`), and the session's window content surface, behind an
  `elsh` bundle load each. The *target*, though, is relative — below a fifth of
  free memory — so a fixed spend has three outcomes and only one of them is the
  test: too few never leaves normal; too many is refused a surface, so a PASS
  gated on the count never latches and the run burns to the 600 s ceiling; and
  in between the run sails past moderate before the photograph, where
  `plans/ICONS.md` **permits** the artwork to be dropped and the assertion was
  scoped out. Only a ~34 MB span of post-boot free memory satisfied all of it,
  and which side of it a boot landed on turned on how much reclaimable cache it
  had accumulated.
  - **The measured state was the third outcome: a vacuous pass.** On the tree
    that closed D79 the band went severe at t=107 s and the frame was
    photographed at window 31, t=124 s — so
    `assert_bar_artwork_survived_screendump` returned `Ok` without comparing a
    pixel. Both green runs measured did this. The vertical was testing "32
    windows can be opened", not what it is named for.
  - **Lowering the per-window cost could not have fixed it.** The span's width
    is set by the watermark gap (mild at a fifth free, the allocator's reserve
    at a sixty-fourth), not by what a window costs, so a cheaper window
    *shifts* the span without widening it: halve the cost and the run needs
    post-boot free memory of ~46–80 MB where the board boots with ~150 MB, and
    32 cheaper windows would never leave normal at all. That resolution would
    have broken the vertical, which is why the choice D80 recorded as a scope
    decision was not one. Three copies of every window's picture remains worth
    attacking on its own merits; it is not this defect.
  - **Fixed by closing the loop on the band.** The clicks are now a *bound*
    (`WINDOW_CLICK_BOUND`, 64 — slack is free, and only a bound too small can
    fail a run) and the state ends it: the guest emits
    `PRESSURE_LEFT_NORMAL_MARKER` when the published band first leaves normal,
    the host photographs there, and two further windows complete the PASS. A
    window costs some 2.6 MiB against watermarks a tenth of the board apart, so
    the first reading above normal is mild — the run stops in the band the
    assertion is *about*, with some nine windows of headroom before a refusal.
    The `pressure_deepened_past_moderate` scope-out, its transcript helper and
    its unit test are deleted: the zero-drift bound now applies on every run.
  - **Two windows after the marker, not one, and why.** One scripted click can
    already be in flight when the band moves, since each is gated on the
    *previous* window reaching the screen. The click after that one waits on a
    record written long after the marker, and the host latches every marker
    from one shared transcript, so it cannot be released without the marker
    having been seen and the frame held. One window can slip past the marker
    and a second cannot, which is what keeps the guest alive across the
    readback.
  - **The harness learned to express a bounded gesture.**
    `Spec::with_bounded_pointer_script` declares a script that repeats until
    the guest reports a state, so an unsent tail is not a failure. It relaxes
    only that: the script must still start, and the gesture stays attested by
    the guest's witnesses and both screendumps, neither reachable without it.
    Every other enrolment keeps the exhaustive default, and both semantics are
    unit-tested.
  - **Measured after the fix.** 65.8 s against 134–151 s before, band leaving
    normal at t=50.8 s after ~19 windows, 22 creates against a bound of 64, no
    deepened-past-moderate record, and both frames compared under the strict
    bound.
- **D80.1 — a refused window is invisible to the user (OPEN, and a policy
  question).** The terminal states "screen surface refused; no window opened"
  on `stderr`, and a graphical app's stderr in a desktop session has no reader
  — the same argument `lib/rt`'s panic reporting already makes for a fatal exit
  (`PANIC_REPORTED`, "a graphical session whose console is the very screen it
  is compositing over"). The charter's refusal clause asks for the app's *own
  UI* when it is interactive, and the terminal has no notice surface; adding
  one is a desktop-UX decision for `plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md`, and routing the
  refusal to the system log instead (the terminal would need `CAP_LOG_EMIT`,
  which `files`, `fstree` and `switchboard` already declare) is the cheaper
  half of it. D80's fix removed the *test's* dependence on this being visible;
  it did not settle where the message should go.
- **D79 — a decorated window's furniture was rendered through a transient the
  size of the whole window, to keep four thin strips — FIXED.**
  `WindowChrome::render` allocated an outer-sized `Surface` (975,840 bytes for
  a default terminal, 7,753,840 for a 1880×1000 one), painted the frame into
  it, copied the four furniture bands out, and freed it. The bands total about
  80 KiB, so the transient was twelve times what is kept, and every one of
  those pixels was written transparent before the paint began. It was per
  *chrome-cache miss*, and the chrome cache is ceilinged at one screenful and
  reclaimed under pressure — precisely the state the D77 soak drives — so a
  screenful of decorated windows re-paid it per frame once the cache went
  cold.
  - **Fixed by the missing capability, not a workaround.** A `Surface` can now
    *be* one rectangle of a larger drawing: `Surface::with_origin(x, y, paint)`
    states, for the duration of one paint, that the buffer's first pixel is
    the drawing's `(x, y)`. Each strip is therefore a surface the size of its
    own band that the whole frame paints into, and every write outside the
    band is off the buffer and dropped. The largest buffer a render asks for
    is one band. The `lib/controls` paint vocabulary is untouched — it keeps
    its unsigned coordinates, which are now the *drawing's*.
  - **One definition, and it reaches every primitive.** The translation lives
    in the one place the clip-and-index arithmetic already lived
    (`span_offsets`), so no primitive can honour a stated origin while another
    forgets it: the row-granular borrows, the row bands a parallel pass
    splits, the blit placement, `admitted`, `with_clip`'s own rectangle, and
    the scan converter's device-space placement and bounds all read the
    drawing's coordinates. The surface-relative primitives (`fill`,
    `mask_to_round_rect`, a design-grid fill) act on the rectangle the buffer
    holds, which is the same rule stated for the whole surface. The alpha
    floor still measures the buffer, because that is what it bounds.
  - **A strip is pixel-identical to the same rectangle of the whole
    drawing** — corner arcs, gradient ramps, the ordered dither, a placed
    sprite and device-space geometry are all sampled where the drawing says
    rather than where the buffer begins. `lib/raster` proves that directly
    against a drawing exercising all of them, band by band.
  - **The band is composed only where it is drawn.** `TitleBar::render`
    returns at once for a surface that admits none of its rectangle
    (`Surface::admits`), because it elides a title and can rasterise an
    identity glyph before its first write — so the three strips the title
    does not reach pay neither.
  - **Regression cover.** `tairix-wm` measures the largest single allocation a
    furniture render makes (a counting `#[global_allocator]` over a warm
    glyph cache) and holds it within what that render retains: 218,312 bytes
    against 286,480 retained for a 1880×1000 window, where the transient
    asked for 7,753,840.
- **D76 — a family of riscv64 QEMU verticals blew their absolute ceiling only
  under the loaded matrix — FIXED.** Completion was bimodal — ~8.7 s or
  never — which said a lost race, not slowness. The device manager lost it:
  with the driver store not yet served it parked for a hardware-tree bump that
  nothing emits, so nothing autoloaded; it now retries under a bounded deadline
  while the catalogue is unfetched. The netstack rows' second half, a peer
  observer that never confirmed a guest that had succeeded, is D95. Neither
  moved a ceiling. Detail below.

- **D106 — the boot-floor volumes publish no I/O source (FIXED).** The fold
  behind the three per-volume queries now has one home
  (`kernel/core/src/fs/blkmeter`) and both kernel-side paths to a disk drive
  it: `BlkClient` over a serving endpoint, and `MeteredBlock` around a device
  the kernel drives itself. The boot floor is the second case — it has no
  endpoint, so nothing folded its counters and `MountRegistry::io_records`,
  the one walk behind all three queries, skipped its volumes. The bring-up
  wraps the disk in a `MeteredBlock` **under** the whole-disk cache (a cache
  hit never reaches the medium, so counting one would report a busy disk that
  is idle), the driver-store service carries the resulting `VolumeIoSource`,
  and both boot-floor registrations attach it — so the `/System` and root
  volumes share one device fold, as every volume on a disk must.
  - **The device identity is reserved, not synthetic-and-hoped.**
    `blkio::kernel_block_device(0)` names the floor's one disk;
    `CallEndpoint::create` refuses any id in that block outright, so the two
    identity spaces are disjoint by construction and a consumer grouping
    volumes by device can never fold a served device together with this one.
  - **Two defects the fix surfaced, both closed with it.** A deadline the
    device consumed whole, and an endpoint torn down under an attempt, folded
    no health at all — so a wedged disk showed zero timeouts; both now
    classify through the shared errno mapping as unanswered attempts (device
    time and a health bucket, no latency to average). And `note_done`'s
    decrement was wrapping, so an unpaired completion would have reported an
    absurd queue depth; it saturates.
  - **Regression cover.** `blkmeter`'s own suite pins the fold, the
    `Attempt::Answered`/`Unanswered` split, the overlay edges and the
    wrapper's forwarding; `mounted_tests` pins that a volume with no source
    is in none of the three queries and one with a source is in all three;
    and the `value-pipe` vertical types `sysinfo storage` on a real boot and
    requires the boot disk's own rows — its reserved identity beside
    `virtio-blk` in the ungated service table, and beside `available` in the
    health table, which prints last.
- **D107 — the report states why a rail group is empty and nothing draws it
  (FIXED).** `lib/controls`' `Tabs` gained the affordance rather than the two
  fields being deleted: deleting them would have discarded a real
  distinction a reader needs. `Tabs::with_absences` takes a
  `TabGroupAbsence` per empty group — its heading, one line under it, and the
  item index it draws *before*, so an empty group appears in its own rail
  position rather than after everything. It is not an item: it selects
  nothing, is never hit-tested, takes no keyboard cursor and shifts no item's
  index, so a statement drawn among the entries cannot move the device a
  press lands on. The Resources rail draws both fields through it, stating
  the refusal where the sample resolved one and "No storage device is
  present." where the query answered and found none.
- **D111 — `approximate-entropy`'s reference distribution runs 0.8 high.**
  What is left of a larger defect. The battery's uniformity arm used to
  assert that every statistic's p-values are exactly Uniform(0, 1), which is
  false for several of them: a p-value is exactly uniform only for a
  continuous statistic read off an exact reference. The arm's power to detect
  its own reference error therefore grew with depth until it rejected any
  generator — and did, on `FastRng` (ChaCha12) and `CsRng` alike, not on a
  predictable one: `NonCryptoRng` is not a soak target at all, so the
  original "maybe it is xoshiro's linearity" reading was wrong.
  **Fixed for four statistics** by deriving the exact distribution of the
  quantity each p-value actually reads — the binomial ones-count
  (`frequency`), an exact multinomial enumeration over three rank classes
  (`matrix-rank`), and the two-barrier reflection expansion for the walk's
  largest excursion (both cumulative sums, which share one null). Chi-square
  on nine degrees of freedom over 144 000 sequences, flat then derived:
  10.7 -> 5.0, 91.4 -> 9.0, 19.9 -> 12.4, 17.5 -> 8.7. The reflection
  expansion was checked against brute force for every barrier at n = 6..12
  before use; each derived null is pinned against its measured histogram.
  **Four statistics keep no derived null and need none urgently.**
  `block-frequency`, `runs`, `longest-run` and `maurer-universal` measure
  consistent with a flat null on two independent generators, and the two
  whose moments were checked match their references exactly (`longest-run`
  5.015 against 5, `block-frequency` 63.93 against 64). `longest-run`'s
  earlier 29.9 was a fluke of one seed set — 5.4 on another — not reference
  error, correcting an earlier note here.
  **What remains is `approximate-entropy`**, the one statistic whose
  reference really is wrong: 71.8 and 55.7 on two independent generators. Its
  chi-square measures 1024.818 +/- 0.119 against the reference's 1024 with the
  variance exact (2050.1 against 2048) — a pure location bias. The
  first-order bias is derivable and equals the independent-sample
  `(2^m - 1) / 2n` exactly, because the words with a period-`d` self-overlap
  number `2^d` and their weighted sum telescopes to `m - 1`, leaving the
  leading correction unchanged; so the residual 0.8 is a higher-order overlap
  term. Deriving it, or replacing the statistic with a non-overlapping form
  whose null is exactly computable, is the open work. Until then its
  uniformity arm is withheld and the verdict says `ProportionOnly`, which is
  a narrower claim and not a weaker gate — its proportion arm is in band and
  the proportion arm is what rejects the controls (`lfsr` on `matrix-rank` at
  a 100% failure rate, `counter` on every statistic, against a 1.16%
  ceiling). Read `plans/FIX-RANDOMNESS.md` and
  `tests/integration/rng_soak/README.md` first.
- **D112 — `stress-qemu-aarch64` never completes: a child's deferred load
  parks and never returns — DONE.** The mount's `SleepLock` was left closed
  on a holder that no longer existed, so every later filesystem call on that
  volume parked for ever and the machine idled with all four cores in
  `run_dispatch_loop`'s masked park.
  **The chain.** A launching child materialises its own image in a *kernel
  body* on its own kernel stack, and parks inside it — on the mount lock, on a
  block completion. The scheduler's per-task body lock is free the moment such
  a task parks, so `SchedulerPolicy::exit` reported the child **quiesced** and
  dropped its control block: its stack frames never unwound, so its wait-queue
  registration (and, had it been the holder, its `SleepGuard`) outlived it.
  The kill gate exists to stop exactly that, but keyed on "inside a *syscall*",
  which a kernel body is not. The release side then completed the wedge:
  `SleepLock::hand_off_oldest` read `wake_task`'s "a row exists" as "the
  successor took it", published ownership to a task that could never claim,
  and left `LOCKED` set. That accounts for the retained transcript exactly —
  `sysmon` and three workers queued behind a fourth that held the lock while
  starved of CPU; the controller's 120-second teardown terminated the queued
  ones, the fourth finished at 129.94 s and handed off to a dead registration,
  and nothing ran again.
  **Closed on both sides.**
  1. *A thread is never destroyed while it is inside the kernel.* The kill
     gate's predicate is now "executing a kernel body on its own stack", not
     "inside a syscall" (`kernel_enter` / `kernel_exit_take_kill`), and the
     deferred-load body brackets itself with it across the build **and** the
     `become_user` yield. A termination taken at that boundary supersedes both
     outcomes: the child neither enters user mode nor reports a load failure.
  2. *Where a death is owed is decided under the gate's one lock*, on the
     in-kernel set, concurrently with the victim's own entry into the kernel,
     and the dispatch loop lands only a death whose thread the scheduler has
     retired (the owed-death protocol is D296's).
  3. *The driver-unload path went through the gate too.* It called
     `SchedulerPolicy::exit` directly, so unloading a driver parked in
     `irq_wait` or mid-filesystem-call hit the same defect. It now records a
     `Plain` teardown in the gate and wakes the thread; the gate's pending
     register carries a `DeferredTeardown` rather than a bare status so a
     death nobody reaps is expressible there.
  4. *An ownership handoff is confirmed, not assumed.* `WaitQueueArch::unpark`
     reports whether the wake landed and `wake_waiter` answers that rather
     than "a row existed"; `hand_off_oldest` drops a registration it could not
     wake and moves to the next-oldest, and withdraws its publication with a
     compare-exchange so a waiter that claimed on an unrelated wake is not
     superseded by a second successor.
  Also fixed here: `SchedulerPolicy::exit`'s repeat request short-circuited on
  its `doomed` claim before looking at whether the victim was still executing,
  so the `Kill` a grace window escalates to issued no nudge at all — all three
  policies now re-nudge a still-executing victim. And the five `fs_lock`
  syscall tests shared one `FileId` against the process-global lock registry,
  which made a lock taken in one visible to a query in another beside it
  (2 failures in 40 whole-crate runs; 0 in 40 once each names its own node).
  **Audited and left alone:** `IRQ_WAITQ`'s one unkeyed registration per task
  is shared by the in-kernel block-completion wait, `irq_wait` and
  `waitset_wait`, so a *nested* use would have the inner park's `deregister`
  destroy the outer registration. It is unreachable: the two syscall handlers
  perform no block I/O (their readiness scans are non-consuming registry
  peeks) and the block wait is not reached from inside either, so no call
  stack holds two at once. Keying it would be speculative surface; the
  constraint belongs in review, not in a second mechanism.
  `SleepLock::lock` likewise stays uninterruptible: a doomed contender waits
  for the holder rather than unwinding, exactly as a doomed syscall caller on
  the same lock already did, and the wait is bounded because every device wait
  inside a holder's critical section carries a deadline and fails closed. A
  killable acquire would have to return a `Result` to every `fs_*` caller with
  no caller needing one today.
  **What corroboration remains.** The original failure never reproduced on
  demand (sixty-plus targeted attempts before the fix), so the vertical's own
  green runs and the nightly soak corroborate rather than prove. Every link in
  the chain above carries a host reproducer that fails before the fix and
  passes after.
- **D113 — `netstack-bond-qemu-aarch64` guest exits before its readiness
  marker.** Same nightly run: `qemu status -1` with "monitor command script
  incomplete: a command's readiness marker was not seen before the guest
  exited". The serial stops at 3.826 s immediately after "inbound echo
  request served (reply queued)", mid-scenario, with **no guest fault,
  panic, or semihosted verdict** — the emulator stopped, rather than the
  kernel failing. A `netstack interface config refused (interface left
  untouched) errno=7` precedes it and may be unrelated.
  **Cause unconfirmed.** A status with no exit code means killed by a signal,
  which is consistent with the *host* killing the process: the QEMU admission
  control weights jobs by vcpu only, with no memory term anywhere, while
  `soak.sh all` fans out 89 jobs. That would make it a host-capacity defect
  wanting bounded concurrency rather than a guest defect — but it is a
  hypothesis, not a diagnosis, and a guest-side exit path has not been ruled
  out. Do not close it as load without evidence.
  **Blocked on** the full serial (retained inline in the failing run's own
  report, as D112's was) and the host's kernel log for the failing run. Read
  `plans/NETWORK.md` first.

## Coupling to be aware of

D1 (FIX-SYSCALL) and D2 (P-6) ride the **same** `request_wake` /
`waitq::drain_pending_wakes` machinery. Whoever executes D2 must not
break the lock-free-ISR + deferred-drain shape the syscall return path
now depends on, and must re-audit exactly the park sites the syscall
path made interruptible (§2.2 — one discipline, not two). Sequence D1
before or alongside D2 where practical, and re-run the FIX-SYSCALL
verticals after D2 lands.

---

## D1 — Close the FIX-SYSCALL residual verticals

**State:** design + code done (T1–T5 of `plans/FIX-SYSCALL.md`); the
aarch64 syscall-body vertical passes. **Remaining:** the same vertical
on the other bare-metal targets, and metal re-confirmation.

- **D1.1 — x86_64 syscall-body vertical.** Port the aarch64
  `preempt`-style syscall-body test to x86_64 under QEMU: a task in a
  deliberately long syscall (a) has a device IRQ / preemption tick
  **taken during** the syscall (delivery), (b) is **not** rescheduled
  mid-syscall (non-preemptibility — IRQ in ring-0 serves-and-returns),
  and (c) is rescheduled at **return-to-user** when `need_resched` is
  latched. Include the wake-timeliness case (a parked blocking syscall
  woken via the lock-free drain).
- **D1.2 — riscv64 syscall-body vertical.** The same, under the riscv64
  QEMU target (`sstatus.SIE` enabled in-syscall, `sret` re-masks).
- **D1.3 — wasm32 (C2) confirmation.** Assert the no-op entry/exit still
  satisfies the deferred-drain + reschedule-at-return semantics via the
  host yield facility.
- **D1.4 — metal re-confirmation.** Re-confirm on Pi hardware that a
  long in-kernel syscall body no longer stalls the preemption tick /
  serial drain / input pump (the 2026-06-23 failure class). Record the
  metal checklist result; do not mark FIX-SYSCALL fully closed until it
  is confirmed.

**Done when:** the syscall-body vertical is green on every bare-metal
Tier-1 target under QEMU, wasm32 is confirmed, metal is re-confirmed,
and `plans/FIX-SYSCALL.md` is updated to done-state (§13) with its
`PLAN.md` sibling-of-P-5 entry finalised.

---

## D2 — P-6: wait-queue §27 completeness rework — DONE (host-proven)

**State:** landed. `kernel/core/src/waitq.rs`'s O(n) `Vec` wait set is
replaced by a three-index `WaitSet` (all `BTreeMap`, `const`-constructible
so the `static` queues keep `const fn new()`), meeting the §27 bar.

**Deliverables (§27 — the complete primitive, not new surface §27.4):**

- **D2.1 — real wait-set structure — DONE.** `by_task: BTreeMap<TaskId,
  Waiter>` gives O(log n) `register`/`deregister`/`wake_task` membership,
  and `order: BTreeMap<seq, TaskId>` (a monotonic arrival sequence) gives
  a *stated* FIFO first-come-first-served no-starvation discipline: the
  oldest `seq` is the head `wake_one`/`oldest_task` release, and a
  re-`register` keeps its `seq` so a looping waiter is never overtaken. No
  linear scan on the per-park path. (An `alloc`-only `BTreeMap` was chosen
  over an intrusive list because the latter needs per-task node storage in
  the scheduler — a far larger change for the same O(log n) removal and no
  `unsafe`.)
- **D2.2 — deadline-ordered structure — DONE.** `deadlines: BTreeMap<
  (deadline_ns, seq), TaskId>` holds only finite-deadline waiters, so
  `earliest_deadline` is O(log n) (the front key) and `sweep` visits only
  the already-expired prefix in deadline order — O(log n + woken), not a
  scan of every waiter per timer expiry. `nearest_timed_deadline` is a
  fixed-arity min over the five timed queues' O(log n) fronts.
- **D2.3 — `wake_one` path — DONE.** `wake_one` (FIFO head) and
  `wake_task` (addressed) are the single-target paths; `wake_all` is kept
  for genuine broadcast conditions only (cancellation, a shared latch
  resolving).
- **D2.4 — preserve P-5's discipline — DONE.** The lock-free ISR
  `request_wake` + deferred `drain_pending_wakes` shape is unchanged
  (§2.2); no second wake/drain path.
- **D2.5 — park sites re-audited — DONE.** Single-target events use
  `wake_task` (`CALL_WAITQ`/`SERVE_WAITQ`/`SIGNAL_INTAKE_WAITQ`); genuine
  broadcasts use `wake_all` (`CONSOLE`/`PROCWAIT`/`PIPE`/`HW_TREE`/
  `USERS_DB`/`APP_STORE`/`SEAT_INPUT`). The rework preserves each choice.

**Tests (§7/§23.4):** host tests cover FIFO wake order + re-register
position preservation, deadline ordering + expired-prefix sweep,
deregister across every index, the wake-one round-robin no-starvation
loop, and the unchanged lock-free `request_wake`/drain race. All 15
`waitq` tests green.

**Done:** `waitq.rs` meets the §27 bar with the above operations,
complexities, and stated fairness discipline; all park sites re-audited;
tests green; `PLAN.md` P-6 updated to done-state.

---

## D3 — Hard-lockup watchdog parity (x86_64, riscv64)

**State:** the soft-lockup detector is cross-arch; **hard-lockup**
detection (the non-maskable buddy cadence + `WatchdogArch`) is wired
only on aarch64 (virtual generic timer `CNTV`, PPI 27). x86_64 and
riscv64 keep only the soft detector and inherit hard detection once they
wire their own non-maskable cadence (`PLAN.md` ~2046, `plans/WATCHDOG.md`).

- **D3.1 — x86_64 hard-lockup cadence.** Wire a non-maskable liveness
  sample (NMI-driven cadence via the local APIC / HPET as the arch
  dictates) behind the existing `WatchdogArch` seam, feeding the
  arch-neutral buddy detector and `request_recovery` — no new surface,
  reuse the aarch64 shape (§2.21).
- **D3.2 — riscv64 hard-lockup cadence.** The same, using the riscv64
  non-maskable/high-priority timer facility.
- **D3.3 — `stuck_interrupt` parity.** Implement `WatchdogArch::
  stuck_interrupt` for each port (the aarch64 `gic::stuck_spi` analogue)
  so the `stuck_irq`/`stuck_state`/`stuck_owner` diagnostics are emitted
  on all bare-metal targets, not just aarch64.
- **D3.4 — conformance vertical.** Extend the `WatchdogArch` conformance
  suite (§17.2) with the hard-lockup case on x86_64 and riscv64 (a
  CPU wedged with IRQs masked is detected and a recovery attempted with
  its honest outcome logged, `CPU_LOCKUP_RECOVERY` 4084).

**Done when:** hard-lockup detection + recovery + stuck-line attribution
work and are conformance-tested on all three bare-metal targets;
`plans/WATCHDOG.md` and the README support matrix updated to match.

---

## D4 — Latent §27 audit sweep of foundational primitives — DONE

**State:** completed. Every foundational primitive `kernel/*`, `lib/*`,
and userland code builds on was read and judged against the §27 bar
(complete abstraction, right structure/complexity for §26 load,
fairness/ordering/wake-one where the abstraction implies it, no O(n) scan
on a load-bearing path). `waitq` (D2) was and remains the **only** thin
slice; every other primitive is §27-complete. One latent structural
watch-item (the slab free-slot scan) is recorded below — it is not a live
defect (its sole production caller uses one slot) and is staged, not
fixed in passing (D4.3).

**D4.1 — primitives enumerated and audited.** The full set below.

**D4.2/D4.3 — audit result (each primitive read, not assumed):**

| Primitive | Structure / complexity | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/sync::SpinLock` / `IrqSafeSpinLock` | test-and-set acquire spin (charter's brief-hold carve-out); `new`/`try_lock`/`lock`/`is_locked`/`get_mut`/`into_inner`/guards | §27-complete |
| `lib/sync::McsLock` | canonical MCS queue lock — strict FIFO fairness, per-waiter local spin, O(1)/op | §27-complete (the fair lock the plain spinlock defers fairness to) |
| `lib/sync::RwLock` | writer-preference; stated fairness invariant (`pending_writers>0` blocks new readers) with a property test | §27-complete |
| `lib/sync::SeqLock` | read-mostly seqlock — `read`/`write`/`sequence`, retry-on-odd | §27-complete |
| `lib/sync::OnceCell` / `Once` | full once-init: `get`/`set`/`get_or_try_init`/`take`/`call_once`(+infallible), poison handling | §27-complete |
| `lib/collections::BitSet256` | 4×u64; full set algebra + subset + popcount + ascending fused iter, all O(1) | §27-complete |
| `lib/caps::CapabilitySet` | 256-bit; full algebra + subset-enforcing `delegate` + `revoke` + wire round-trip; delegation-never-widens property-tested (§19.7) | §27-complete |
| `lib/caps::CapToken` | unforgeable token vocabulary (`token.rs`) | §27-complete |
| `kernel/ipc::PortRegistry` | `BTreeMap` endpoint + name indexes — O(log n) `lookup`/`resolve`/`register`/`unregister`; bulk `teardown_owned_by` O(n) only on process exit (not a hot path) | §27-complete |
| `kernel/ipc` `call`/`port`/`notify` | reply/mailbox/notification queues over the shared `waitq` wake/drain discipline (D2) | §27-complete |
| `lib/kalloc::FreeListAllocator` | two tiers behind one `GlobalAlloc`: a header-free per-size-class slab up to the page granule, coalescing segregated fit over boundary tags above it; growable/shrinkable via `HeapSource`; deterministic OOM (null, never panic) | §27-complete (O(1) allocate, free, coalesce and region/page reclaim — no list walked on any path; pinned by the two per-operation node-reach tests) |
| `lib/rt` heap | first-fit over a coalesced, address-sorted free-**span** list; growable `SpanStore` (§24.1/§25); realloc grow/shrink in place | §27-complete (same standard first-fit design; §25-bound) |
| `kernel/mem::Slab` | guard-page + tag-rotation + zero-on-free + double-free/dirty-slot hardened fixed-size slab | §27-complete for its use — **watch-item** below |

**Slab free-slot scan — recorded, staged, not fixed in passing (D4.3).**
`Slab::alloc` finds a free slot with an `O(slot_count)` linear scan of the
`in_use` bitmap rather than an `O(1)` free-index. This is **not a live
§27 defect**: the sole production constructor (`kernel/core/src/kthread.rs`
kthread-stack slab) uses `slot_count == 1`, so the scan is O(1) in
practice, and the slab's purpose is guard/tag hardening of small, few-slot
object classes, not a high-fan-out hot-path allocator. It is recorded as a
latent structural watch-item: **should a large-`slot_count` consumer ever
be introduced, `Slab` must first gain an O(1) free-slot index (a free-slot
stack/head) so the allocation hot path does not become O(n) under §26
load.** Staged as a `PLAN.md` note rather than reworked here, per D4.3 (do
not fix in passing; the abstraction is complete and correct for every
present caller).

**Done:** every enumerated foundational primitive audited against §27 and
confirmed complete (table above); the one latent structural concern (slab
free-slot scan) recorded and staged with its specific trigger; no other
thin-slice core found; no in-scope code fix was required (all present
callers are served correctly), so the sweep lands as the recorded audit.

## D5 — `mem-pin-migration` intermittent multi-vCPU-TCG stall — DONE

**Root cause.** A lost-wakeup in the vertical's *own* secondary-CPU idle
loop (`tests/integration/mem_pin_qemu_aarch64/src/kernel.rs`
`migration_secondary`), not the scheduler or the CI runner. The re-rolled
secondary loop parked on a bare `wfi` with IRQ taking **enabled** and
without re-checking the run queue: when a placement/reschedule IPI landed
in the window between `step` returning `Idle` and the `wfi`, the handler
took and acknowledged the SGI, so the following `wfi` then slept with a
just-readied task already on this CPU's run queue (`wake_from_parked`
enqueues *before* `send_ipi`). During the parent phase no further IPI is
sent, so the CPU slept indefinitely and the guest made no progress until
the wall-clock budget fired. It reproduces only under QEMU-TCG timing
jitter, hence the isolation-passes / full-matrix-stalls signature.

**Fix.** `migration_secondary`'s idle and paused branches now use the
same race-free park the production dispatch loop uses
(`kernel/core/src/init.rs` `run_dispatch_loop`): mask IRQ taking, drain
flagged wakes and re-check `Scheduler::has_ready_work(cpu)` (and the pause
flag) under the mask, `wfi` only if still genuinely idle, then re-enable —
so an IPI arriving in the check→park window stays pending-but-masked and
wakes the `wfi`. No budget bump, no retry.

**Regression coverage.** The mirrored protocol is guarded host-
deterministically by `run_dispatch_loop`'s
`idle_commit_rechecks_work_published_after_the_idle_step` unit test
(work published inside the masked idle-commit window must not let the
dispatcher sleep). A per-window micro-reproducer is not feasible for a
hardware-timing race; the fix removes the harness's divergence from that
tested protocol, and the vertical now runs it.

## D6 — `docs-check` cross-crate resolution failure — DONE (a poisoned build cache)

**State:** closed. `docs-check` is green and the failure class is
root-caused, so a recurrence is a known-cause operational condition with a
fixed remedy rather than an open defect.

**The mechanism.** `docs-check` (`cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
--document-private-items -Z rustdoc-mergeable-info`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D
warnings"`) failed to resolve real, unconditional `pub` items in
feature-less workspace crates — `tairix_arch_api`, `tairix_reclaim`,
`tairix_tty::read_bounded`, `tairix_qemu::ReservedSocket` and others. A
`cargo` build killed mid-flight leaves **zero-byte `.rmeta`** files that the
build's own fingerprints still record as fresh, so a later build accepts
truncated metadata. The errors come from *rustc* checking a dependent crate,
not from rustdoc — so this is **not** evidence against
`-Z rustdoc-mergeable-info`, and that flag stays.

**Remedy, in order.** On a "can't find crate for `<workspace crate>`"
failure, check for truncated metadata first:

```sh
find target -name '*.rmeta' -size 0
```

Any hits mean a full `cargo clean`, immediately: on a multi-crate cascade a
`cargo clean -p` of the named crates only moves the failure to the next
consumer, and deleting the zero-byte files by hand does not help either
because the fingerprints still call those units fresh. A `-p` clean is
enough only for a single-crate instance with no cascade behind it. A green
re-run *after* such a clean is a real fix, not a retry — the cache, not the
code, was wrong.

**Avoiding it.** Never kill a `cargo` process mid-build, and **batch** the
cross-target builds and lints separately from the host runs rather than
alternating between them: every observed instance followed interleaved host
and `--target <triple>` invocations where one was interrupted.

**The one contingency that would reopen this.** If it recurs with no killed
build behind it — no zero-byte rmeta, and `cargo clean -p` does not clear
it — treat it as a genuine cross-crate-rustdoc / mergeable-info defect, not
a load flake: capture whether it appears only under the concurrent
`cargo xtask ci` static-gate group (memory pressure) or standalone too, and
the structural fix is to drop `-Z rustdoc-mergeable-info` from
`run_docs_check` (`tools/xtask/src/commands.rs`), since mergeable-info is a
doc-build *speed* optimisation and doc-build correctness outranks it.

## D7 — x86_64 disk-completion interrupt triple-faulted the boot — DONE

**State:** fixed. The live x86_64 disk bring-up now delivers the
virtio-blk-PCI completion interrupt, wakes the scheduler-parked bring-up
repeatedly, and mounts the read-only `/System` volume — proven by
`tests/integration/root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` (keys PASS on
`root_mount::SYSTEM_VOLUME_MOUNTED_MESSAGE`).

**Root cause (two x86_64 defects, both fixed).** The symptom looked like
"the parked kthread never wakes" (the serial stalls with no prompt), but
the guest was actually **triple-faulting** (`qemu -d int`: a ring-3 `#PF`
storm, then a kernel `#PF` in `syscall_entry_stub` with `RSP=0` /
`CR2=-8`, → `#DF`). Two independent bugs:

1. **External-IRQ ISR read the interrupted CPU frame at the wrong stack
   offset.** `external_irq.s` pushes a synthetic *vector qword* between the
   15-GPR `SavedRegs` block and the CPU-pushed `InterruptStackFrame`, but
   the shared `preempt::preempt_ring3_if_pending` located the frame at
   `regs + size_of::<SavedRegs>()` — correct only for the *timer* stub,
   which pushes no vector qword. On a device IRQ it read the vector qword
   as the interrupted `CS`, mis-decided ring-3, and ran an unbalanced
   `swapgs`; a later `syscall` then loaded `kernel_rsp0` from the wrong GS
   base (0) → push into a null stack → `#DF`. Fix:
   `preempt_ring3_if_pending` now takes the `InterruptStackFrame` pointer,
   and each ISR computes it at its own offset (the external path adds
   `EXTERNAL_VECTOR_QWORD_BYTES`). Timer-driven preemption (used by
   `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64`, which passed) was unaffected, which is why
   only the disk (external-IRQ) path crashed. Host guard:
   `irq::tests::external_irq_frame_sits_one_vector_qword_above_saved_regs`.
2. **The MSI-X source shared an IO-APIC pin's vector.** `virtio_blk_unlock`
   reused the PCI interrupt-line GSI's vector for the device's MSI and
   drove that pin's *level* `IoApicController` for an *edge* MSI. Fixed by
   `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/x86_64/msi.rs`: a dedicated MSI vector +
   virtual `MSI_LINE_BASE` line space with an edge no-op
   `CompositeIrqController` (the Linux / aarch64-`MSI_LINE_BASE` model), so
   an MSI-X source is never bound to a shared IO-APIC pin. Boot pre-installs
   the free external vectors as MSI lines; `root_unlock` allocates a
   dedicated `(vector, line)`.

## D8 — x86_64 encrypted-root / users-DB read loop stalls the interactive unlock — DONE

**State:** resolved. `root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` now boots the full
two-kthread admission path through the interactive encrypted-root unlock and
keys PASS on `unlock_service::USERS_DB_INSTALLED_MESSAGE`, with the scripted
`ARXFS passphrase:` step restored — the kthread-admission install witness the
vertical was scoped to reach. The former deterministic stall does not
reproduce; the install completes deterministically (confirmed over repeated
untraced guest boots).

**Root cause.** D8 was a consequence of the pre-fix kernel-heap OOM/pressure
condition, not a logic loop in the read path. On the 256 MiB admission guest
the two concurrent disk kthreads (the interactive-unlock kthread and the
driver-store serve kthread) drove the pressure-governed
`BlockCache`/`SharedBlock` while the kernel heap could not grow past the old
8 MiB `MAX_ORDER` granule: allocations for the encrypted-root/users-DB read
path met sustained memory pressure that both starved the clean-block cache
(so the hot metadata blocks were re-read from the device instead of served)
and, at the OOM edge, prevented net forward progress within any budget —
hence "5000+ `notify_wait` returns, no log-visible progress, identical at
120 s and 300 s". The `kernel/mem` `frame::MAX_ORDER` 11 → 13 (8 MiB → 32 MiB)
growth plus the `appspawn::read_file` fallible-reserve read (landed for the
kernel-heap OOM defect after D8 was filed) removed that condition: the heap
now grows to back the read path, the pressure that drained the cache and
blocked progress no longer arises, and the admission install terminates.

**Evidence (traced boot).** A temporary per-read LBA trace on the boot
`BlockCache` device path confirmed the admission boot now makes monotonic
forward progress to `id=4139 root-unlock: users database installed` and on
to the login screen — two interleaved *advancing* read streams (the two
kthreads), not a single block re-read forever. Residual re-reading of hot
metadata blocks under the tight guest is the memory-pressure cache design
working as intended (drop clean, rebuildable blocks under pressure, re-read
on demand) — bounded, forward-progressing, and fail-closed, not the D8 loop.

**Regression.** `root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` is extended to the
users-DB-install witness (was: the `/System` mount), so a re-introduction of
either the D7 triple fault or a D8-class admission stall fails the run loud;
the observer `root_unlock_login_qemu_x86_64` never drives this concurrent
two-kthread path, so this vertical is its only guard.

## D9 — x86_64 `spawn-session` login never exits on the (now live) console — DONE

**State:** fixed. `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` reaches its seven-spawn
`wait`→reap→relaunch witness and passes a real guest boot.

**Root cause — two layers.** The vertical's PASS keys on **seven**
`ProcessSpawned` — `init`, the boot services `sysinfod` / `netstack` /
`devmgr` / `seatmgr`, the first `login`, and the **relaunched** `login`
after `init` reaps the first. Its documented model assumed the x86_64
console had *no read backing*, so `login`'s `stream_read` failed closed at
`NULL_CONSOLE_READ` and `login` exited. The A3 interrupt-driven COM1 receive
path made that assumption false: the diskless boot opens `CONSOLE0_GATE` at
the init seam (`root_unlock::spawn_if_present`, no binding →
`release_console0_to_login`), so `login` owns console 0 and its read is a
**live, poll-backed COM1 read**. With no scripted input `login` correctly
*waited* (a timed `stream_read` returning `TimedOut` → the view's idle
refresh re-queries `sysinfod`, the `ipc_call`s each replying cleanly). So
the test had to be brought in line with its aarch64 sibling and *drive*
login to exit.

Doing so exposed the **real production defect** underneath: the x86_64
COM1 log sink (`SerialSink::write_event`) and console-write backing
(`Com1Console::write`) called `Serial::init(COM1_BASE)` on **every** log
line / console write. `Serial::init` is *not* idempotent for an armed
interactive console — it writes `IER = 0` (disarming the receive interrupt
the login console enabled) and the FIFO-control clear bits (flushing the
receive FIFO). Under the debug-log flood a re-init raced `login`'s
interactive read and **silently dropped the typed input** while disabling
receive delivery — an intermittent hang. This is a genuine bug in the A3
console work: on real hardware, any log output or prompt write while a user
types at the x86_64 login would drop keystrokes.

**Fix (production + test).**
- **Production (`x86_64/serial_sink.rs`):** a `com1_writer()` helper brings
  the 16550 up **exactly once** (a `tairix_sync::Once` guard) and returns
  the non-reinitialising `Serial::at` on every later call. `SerialSink` and
  `Com1Console` route through it, so diagnostic output and prompt writes
  never clear `IER` or flush the receive FIFO. The `Serial::at` seam and its
  "init clears IER/FIFO" warning already existed; the write paths simply
  stopped re-initialising.
- **Test (`qemu_tests.rs`):** the x86_64 enrolment scripts a serial dialogue
  typing one character past `MAX_USERNAME_LEN` at the `Username:` field so
  the view refuses the over-long line (`LengthOutOfRange`), `login` fails
  closed and exits, and `init` reaps + relaunches it (seventh
  `ProcessSpawned`). The injected line is **newline-terminated**
  (`OVERLONG_USERNAME`, shared with aarch64) so it is a complete line the
  reader receives whether the console is in the view's raw discipline or a
  cooked line discipline. The stale test-crate module doc and enrolment
  comment are corrected to the live-console model.

Verified: `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` is stable over repeated runs (was
~40 % flaky before the production fix); the aarch64 sibling still passes.

## Definition of done (whole plan, §7/§15/§23)

This umbrella is closed only when D1–D9 are each closed on their own
whole-project-green gate:

- D1: syscall-body verticals green on all bare-metal targets + wasm32
  confirmed + metal re-confirmed; FIX-SYSCALL marked done.
- D2: **DONE** — `waitq.rs` at the §27 bar (three-index O(log n)
  `WaitSet`, stated FIFO no-starvation) with tests; P-6 marked done.
- D3: hard-lockup watchdog + diagnostics conformance-tested on all three
  bare-metal targets.
- D4: **DONE** — every foundational primitive audited against §27
  (findings table recorded); all complete, the one latent structural
  concern (slab free-slot scan) staged; no in-scope code fix required.
- D5: **DONE** — the `mem-pin-migration` multi-vCPU-TCG stall root-caused
  to a lost-wakeup in the vertical's secondary idle loop and structurally
  fixed (production masked-park protocol); a full `cargo xtask ci` is
  whole-project-green.
- D6: **DONE** — the cross-crate `docs-check` resolution failure
  root-caused to a poisoned build cache (zero-byte rmeta left by a `cargo`
  build killed mid-flight, still fingerprinted fresh), not to rustdoc or
  mergeable-info; `docs-check` passes end to end. The detection recipe, the
  full-`cargo clean` remedy, and the one contingency that would reopen it are
  recorded in its section.
- D7: **DONE** — the x86_64 disk-completion-interrupt triple fault
  root-caused (external-IRQ frame offset + shared IO-APIC-pin MSI vector)
  and fixed; `root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` reaches the `/System`
  mount over the dedicated MSI-X vector.
- D8: **DONE** — the x86_64 encrypted-root / users-DB admission stall
  root-caused to the pre-fix kernel-heap OOM/pressure condition (removed by
  the `kernel/mem` `MAX_ORDER` growth + `appspawn` fallible-reserve read);
  `root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` extended to key PASS on the users-DB
  install and confirmed deterministic over repeated guest boots.
- D9: **DONE** — root-caused to a stale dead-console test model *and* a real
  production bug it exposed: the x86_64 COM1 log sink / console-write backing
  re-ran `Serial::init` per write, clearing `IER` and flushing the receive
  FIFO and so dropping the interactive `login`'s typed input. Fixed by a
  one-time `com1_writer` init guard (`x86_64/serial_sink.rs`) plus an
  aarch64-aligned over-long-username serial script in the enrolment;
  `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` reaches its seven-spawn witness and is stable.
- For each landing: `cargo fmt --all` (+ `--check`), `cargo xtask ci`
  (once), `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5`, and `tools/ci/soak.sh both
  --secs 20` green and quoted; §23 self-review verdict stated.
- Housekeeping: `PLAN.md` immediate-work list reflects the closures, the
  README support matrix updated where a per-arch mark changes, and a row
  added to the `AGENTS.md` §15.18 jump-sheet:
  `Open core-kernel defect tracking → plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`.

## D10 — `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` intermittent terminal-focus freeze — DONE

**State:** fixed. The `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64` vertical is stable over
repeated runs; the intermittent freeze (guest goes fully idle at the AW4
terminal stage, run times out) no longer occurs.

**Root cause — a fragile *test-harness* readiness gate, not a kernel
lost-wakeup.** The freeze was intermittent (timing-dependent), not the
deterministic deadlock first suspected. The harness gated the
terminal-window focus click on a **global count of window-endpoint
`CallReplied` records** (`TERMINAL_WINDOW_REPLIES = 4`). That count
includes window *presents*, not just window *creates*: it assumed the
files window presents exactly once (create + one startup present, 2
replies), so the 4th reply would be the terminal's create/present. But a
files-window click that lands so it repaints (a timing-sensitive outcome
under certain boot pacing) adds extra present replies; when the files
stage emitted ≥4 replies, the 4th `CallReplied` occurred *during the files
stage*, so the terminal-focus click fired onto the empty desktop before
the terminal window existed (→ files unfocus = the lone stray delivery),
the terminal was never focused, the typed-command delivery gate never
advanced, and the guest idled. The desktop session and `lib/window`
delivery path were correct throughout; the app-ward `ipc_send` is
non-blocking and the kernel wakes were not lost.

**Fix — gate each in-window click on that window being *on screen*.** A
count of replies over a shared rendezvous can be advanced by anyone; a count
of window *creations* cannot, but it says only that the window **exists**.
Since the session shows a served window on its client's first present
(`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3), existence is not visibility, and a creation-keyed
gate races that present — the shape this defect returned in once the mapping
moved to the present. Both in-window clicks therefore key on the session's own
per-window witness that a frame carrying it reached the display
(`WINDOW_SHOWN_MARKER` = `tairix_desktop_session::WINDOW_SHOWN_MESSAGE`),
occurrence 1 for the files window and 2 for the terminal. Only the session can
state that fact, and the launched applications are the only window-channel
clients in the image, so the occurrences name those two windows and nothing
else.

**Regression guard.** Host test
`qemu_tests::tests::every_served_window_click_gates_on_that_window_being_on_screen`
asserts both clicks key on the window-shown witness at their own occurrence,
and that **no** step keys on the present-inclusive `CallReplied` count or on
the existence-only `sc=shm_map` frame map — so none of the three superseded
gates can return. The QEMU vertical itself is the end-to-end guard.

**Note.** riscv64/x86_64 autoload siblings are input-only (no display,
desktop, or terminal stage), so this gate exists only in the aarch64
vertical's shared pointer-script contract; no sibling change was needed.

## D11 — `netstack-listener-qemu-aarch64` RTO-cadence crawl — DONE

**State:** fixed. The wedge (single-CPU guest going fully idle for a whole
TCP-RTO interval and only stepping forward on the host's retransmit) no
longer occurs; the transfer proceeds at line rate.

**Root cause — depth-1 transmit staging, candidate (b), not a scheduler
lost-wakeup.** `lib/virtio_net` held exactly **one** transmit staging pair,
so each `service()` could hand at most one frame to the device: `drain_tx`
sent the first queued frame, saw the single pair in flight, and left every
further queued frame (the TCP ACK sitting right behind a data segment) in
the shared frame ring as "back-pressure" with no re-service scheduled. The
trailing frame therefore egressed only on the *next* `service`, which the
stack issues from a device interrupt — so a run of frames drained at the
device's completion-interrupt cadence and, when the frame ring backed up,
the host stopped advancing until its RTO retransmit (an unrelated RX IRQ)
drove the next service. The CFQ park/unpark handshake and the
`serve_wake_task`/`waitset_wait` path were correct throughout (candidates
(a)/(c) ruled out).

**Fix — multi-in-flight transmit pipelining (`lib/virtio_net`).** The single
`tx_header`/`tx_data`/`tx_inflight` fields are replaced by an
allocation-free `TxStaging` pool of header+frame staging pairs whose depth is
derived from the discovered machine and the device's own advertised queue
maximum (`QueueDepths`, two descriptors per in-flight frame). Each `service`
reaps **every** completed transmission (returning its staging pair to the
pool, keyed by the descriptor head the used ring reports) and then stages
**every** queued frame until the frame ring is empty or the pool is
exhausted. A data segment and the ACK behind it now egress together in one
call; back-pressure applies only when the ring is genuinely full, and even
then never waits (safe across the cross-process `Service` boundary) and
never drops. `stage_and_post` returns `TxOutcome::Sent(head)` so a
completion maps back to exactly its staging pair; a malformed/device-
fabricated completion reclaims nothing (fail closed). No busy-poll, no ABI
change, no timeout bump.

**Regression guards (host, `lib/virtio_net`).**
`service_egresses_a_burst_in_one_call_without_a_completion` proves a
multi-frame burst all egresses in one `service` with the device undriven
(the depth-1 predecessor sent only the first);
`transmit_back_pressure_only_when_the_ring_is_full` proves back-pressure
fires only with the whole pool in flight and the held frames then egress in
order. The QEMU vertical itself is the end-to-end guard.

**Note.** riscv64/x86_64 share the same `lib/virtio_net` engine, so the fix
is arch-neutral (`§2.2`); no per-arch change was needed. Receive staging
stays single-buffered (re-posted each frame) — a separate concern the stack
rides out via TCP retransmit, out of scope for this transmit-egress fix.

**Definitive crawl cause — a rejected cumulative ACK during loss recovery
(`lib/net` `tcp_conn.rs`), the real reason the vertical timed out.** The
transmit-pipelining fix above was necessary but did not stop the crawl: with
the peer injecting guest→peer loss, the guest echo server enters
retransmission, and both go-back-N on RTO (`advance`, `snd_nxt = snd_una`)
and fast retransmit rewind the next-to-send cursor `snd_nxt` back below the
true transmit high-water `snd_max`. `process_ack` then bounded its
"ACK acknowledges something not yet sent" challenge (RFC 5961 §5) on the
*rewound* `snd_nxt` instead of `snd_max`, so a valid cumulative ACK covering
`(snd_nxt, snd_max]` — data the peer demonstrably held — was challenged and
dropped without advancing `snd_una`. `snd_una` froze, the sender
retransmitted already-acknowledged bytes every (doubling) RTO, and the
connection eventually hit the user timeout and RST. Fixed by gating that
challenge on `snd_max` (the highest sequence ever transmitted, which
`Plan::Retransmit` never advances) and, when a cumulative ACK advances
`snd_una` past the rewound cursor, carrying `snd_nxt` forward to preserve
`snd_una <= snd_nxt`. Regression guard (host, `lib/net`):
`cumulative_ack_advances_una_past_a_recovery_rewound_snd_nxt` establishes a
connection, bursts several segments, fires the RTO to rewind `snd_nxt`, then
delivers a cumulative ACK up to `snd_max` and asserts `snd_una` advances and
the RTO disarms (it froze before the fix). Arch-neutral — every port shares
`lib/net`.

## D13 — secondary-CPU hard lockup under `stress --cpu 20` — DONE (the kernel heap lock was not interrupt-safe)

**State:** closed. `stress --cpu 20` no longer wedges on metal, which was
this defect's stated done-condition.

**The symptom.** On the debug image a secondary core reported a bare hard
lockup (`cpu=3 context=kernel sampled=pre_silence k_site=task_body`). Because
the watchdog liveness sample rides a *maskable* virtual-timer IRQ — GICv2
non-secure has no NMI — a hard lockup means the core entered an IRQ-masked
EL1 critical section and never left it, which is precisely what no maskable
sample can observe from the inside.

**Root cause.** `tairix_kalloc` guarded the kernel heap with a plain
`AtomicBool` spinlock that never masked interrupts. TAIRiX takes interrupts
while in-kernel code runs, so an interrupt arriving on a CPU already holding
that lock — the eMMC completion IRQ during a `BlockCache::populate`
allocation on the root-unlock read path — whose handler itself allocated
re-entered `alloc` and spun forever on the lock its own interrupted mainline
held. A single-CPU self-deadlock, IRQ-masked because exception entry masks
`DAIF.I`, hence unsampleable. It fits every observed trait: any CPU, ~10 s in
under heavy concurrent boot allocation (ARXFS reads plus USB bring-up),
`sampled=pre_silence` (the stale sample *is* the last tick before the handler
wedged), `k_site=user_switch` (the arch IRQ handler stamps no breadcrumb),
and real-hardware-mostly, since the interrupt-vs-lock interleaving under heavy
allocation rarely arises in QEMU.

**The fix.** `tairix_kalloc` carries an installable interrupt-control seam
(`install_irq_control(disable, restore)`, two set-once `fn`-pointer atomics
read outside the lock); `with_inner` masks the current CPU's interrupts
before acquiring and restores after releasing. Each port installs its arch
primitive at `boot()` entry — before interrupts are ever enabled and before
any secondary CPU or hart starts, so one install covers every core because
the hooks mask the *calling* CPU: aarch64 `DaifIrqControl`, x86_64
`RflagsIrqControl`, riscv64 `sstatus.SIE`. The interrupt-free `wasm32` port
and the host test build install nothing.

**The seam is crate-global, because the first shape of it was fail-open.**
Per-allocator hooks reached through a registration seam silently no-op'd when
nothing had registered, and only the production `main.rs` ever registered —
so on every freestanding QEMU test bin — each declares its own
`#[global_allocator]` — the heap lock stayed interrupt-unsafe and the root
cause was live across the whole QEMU matrix, including the `stress` vertical
whose job is to confirm this fixed. The hooks describe the machine rather
than any one heap, so they live at crate scope in `lib/kalloc` and the ports
call `tairix_kalloc::install_irq_control` directly. Regression:
`the_lock_masks_interrupts_via_the_installed_control` pins both halves — the
lock masks then restores around each hold once a control is installed and
not before, *and* an allocator built after the install that no registry knows
about is interrupt-safe too.

**Adjacent defects that shared this defect's signature, each closed on its
own:** the Pi 4 near-every-boot *boot* wedge was D81 (a block split
invalidating one page instead of the block's whole range); the QEMU stress
vertical's own early-boot silence was D84 (a lost wake-up in the sleeping
mutex, every core idle rather than wedged); the mute same-EL fault that made
one boot conclusive where a dozen before it were not was D83.

**Standing invariant — the self-sample FIQ sits strictly below the
preemption timer.** `Gicv2::enable_intid` once gave every PPI the same
mid-range priority (`0x80`), so the debug watchdog's Group-0 FIQ self-sample
equalled the preemption-timer IRQ. With `GICC_CTLR.FIQEn` set, a
pending-but-masked Group-0 FIQ of priority ≥ the timer IRQ holds that IRQ
off — permanently once the level-triggered watchdog counter has fired on
every core — so preemption dies and the shell can no longer spawn. The
self-sample is therefore pinned below the timer
(`watchdog::WATCHDOG_FIQ_PRIORITY = 0xC0`, applied via `gic::set_ppi_priority`
in both the boot probe and per-CPU `route_watchdog_group0`); a Group-0 FIQ is
still signalled independently of a pending Group-1, so the masked-section
self-sample still fires. The ordering is a **compile-time** guard — a
`const _: () = assert!(WATCHDOG_FIQ_PRIORITY > MID_RANGE_PRIORITY && … < 0xFF)`
— so regressing it back to an equal priority fails the build rather than
silently reintroducing the stall; `set_priority_writes_the_priority_byte`
covers the register write itself.

**`DAIF.F` is unmasked only when the runtime probe proved FIQ deliverable.**
Both unmask sites consult `fiq_cadence_enabled()` and fail closed: the base
lock mask is unconditionally I+F, and F is re-cleared only where a FIQ can
actually be delivered. Gating on the compile-time feature alone left the
debug build exposed to secure-world Group-0 FIQs the non-secure kernel
cannot service, on exactly the hardware where the probe returns
`Unsupported` and no self-sample benefit exists.

### The masked-section observers, retained

These were built to chase this defect and stay as the standing tools for any
future IRQ-masked wedge. Both are debug-gated and compile out of a shippable
image.

- **FIQ self-sample** (non-maskable in-core sample). Needs a `DAIF.F`-clear
  execution discipline plus GICv2 Group-0 routing, with a fail-closed boot
  deliverability probe reported as a `FeatureSupport` capability:
  `Supported` on a single-Security-state GIC, `Unsupported` on a
  two-Security-state one, where it falls back to the buddy detector. QEMU
  `virt` defaults to `secure=off` and therefore self-samples; a real Pi 4
  GIC-400 (and `virt,secure=on`) keeps Group 0 secure and returns
  `Unsupported`. Witness: `tests/integration/fiq_selfsample_qemu_aarch64`
  asserts a live in-kernel PC captured with `SPSR_EL1.I` masked
  (`sampled=live`).
- **CoreSight external-debug (`EDPCSR`) cross-core sample** — the observer
  the FIQ path cannot be where Group 0 is secure. One core reads a wedged
  core's PC over the memory-mapped ARMv8 external-debug interface (DDI 0487
  H9): it neither halts the target nor rides an interrupt `DAIF` can mask.
  `WatchdogArch::remote_pc_sample` (default `Unsupported`, with its
  conformance vertical) renders a fresh image-relative `live_pc` beside —
  never replacing — the stale `pc`. Discovery parses the Linux
  `arm,coresight-cpu-debug` binding, and a base is installed only when its
  gigapage is already Device-mapped so a read can never fault. QEMU models no
  `EDPCSR` and the stock Pi 4 firmware DTB describes no debug nodes, so
  enabling it on that hardware is a **provisioning** step — the firmware DTB
  or an overlay must carry those nodes — not a code change.

### Debug-only diagnostics retained from the investigation

All feature-gated (`watchdog-diagnostics`), all compiled out of a shippable
image, all host-tested: the per-CPU `k_lock` stuck-lock site record —
including the kernel heap lock, the one IRQ-masking lock every subsystem
descends into — with per-entry `k_lock_state` so a spinning waiter is never
mislabelled a holder; a validated `k_bt` frame-pointer walk that accepts a
return address only inside kernel text and only on a strictly increasing
frame pointer above the exception frame, so a stack data word can never be
emitted as a caller; the `AddressSpaceRegistry::withdraw` post-condition
tripwire that faults at the reclaim site if a per-task map still holds a
withdrawn task; the always-on `KernelInternalLines` seam that names a stuck
line the kernel services through its own chained handler
(`stuck_owner=console-uart` / `pcie-msi`, interrupt numbers from the device
tree, never board constants) instead of a bare `unbound`; and the
`SwitchReturn` breadcrumb splitting the post-switch IRQ-masked teardown from
the switch-in, so a wedge coming back from a task is distinguishable from one
going into it.

**Known residual, recorded not buried.** Heap growth runs *under* the heap
lock and takes the frame allocator's and kernel-remap window's plain
`SpinLock`s, so an ISR that allocated while interrupting an EL1 mainline
holding one of those would self-deadlock one layer down. No such path exists:
every ISR-reachable path is lock-free and allocation-free except the
return-to-user preempt point, whose interrupted context is EL0 and therefore
holds no kernel lock. The allocator masking is correct defence-in-depth; the
layer below needs the same treatment only if an ISR ever allocates from an
EL1-interrupting context.

The Pi 4B armstub FIQ-routing dependency remains a hardware-capability
concern for `plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md`.

## D21 — a layered block device republishes an unreadable member class as `Virtual` (OPEN)

**State:** the mount-medium path is honest end to end *except* across a
republishing layer. Discovered while landing the storage medium on
`MountRecord`; the decode half was fixed in that change, the trait half is
staged here because it touches every implementor of the block trait.

**Mechanism.** Three facts compose into a fabricated hardware claim:

- `blkio::decode_outcome` now yields `Option<BlkDeviceClass>`, so a class
  word the ABI does not define stays an explicit unknown rather than being
  rewritten to `Virtual`. `BlkDeviceClass::served_as(None)` is the single
  patience policy: an unknown is *served* `Virtual`'s bounded envelope
  without ever being *called* `Virtual`. That half is correct.
- `Block::device_class()` is concrete by construction — its trait default
  returns `BlkDeviceClass::Virtual`, and both clients document their result
  as the **served** class. There is no way for an implementor to say "the
  device told me something I cannot read".
- `blkio::serve` publishes that concrete value straight back onto the wire
  (`let class = Some(device.device_class());`). So a layer over a device
  whose class word was unreadable — the block-service seam re-serving a
  `RemoteBlock`, a partition window, the block cache, a RAID array folding
  members through `BlkDeviceClass::most_patient` — republishes
  `Some(Virtual)`: an identity indistinguishable from a genuine paravirtual
  device, asserted by a layer that was never told it.

That value is no longer confined to budget sizing. It threads from the
completion through `BlkClient::declared_class()` → `MountBacking` →
`MountPoint::medium()` → `MountRecord::medium()`, so the System Information
API can report a storage medium no driver ever declared. Sizing a cautious
I/O budget from an unknown is right; *naming* the unknown is not.

**Blast radius today (small, and only by luck).** The single user-visible
consumer of `MountRecord::medium()` is the drive icon, and
`tairix_icon::disk_icon` maps both `Some(Virtual)` and `None` to the same
generic `Disk` glyph — so nothing is currently misdrawn. Nothing else reads
the field yet. The gap is therefore latent, not cosmetic: the first consumer
that distinguishes "paravirtual" from "unknown" (a medium column in `df` or
`mount`, a volume-properties panel, a policy that treats virtual disks
differently) reads a fabricated fact with no way to tell.

**Structural fix.** Widen the accessor, keep the one patience policy:

- `Block::device_class()` returns `Option<BlkDeviceClass>`, defaulting to
  `None` (an implementor that knows nothing says nothing) rather than to a
  class it invented.
- Every implementor and forwarding layer carries the `Option` through: the
  partition window, the block cache, the retained journal, `SharedBlock`,
  the six RAID array kinds, USB mass storage, and both clients
  (`lib/blkclient`, `kernel/core/src/fs/blkclient.rs`) with their fixtures.
- `most_patient` folds `Option`s, so a composition with one unreadable
  member reports its medium as unknown — which it is — while still being
  *served* the widest envelope through `served_as`. Patience behaviour is
  unchanged at every call site; only the published identity becomes honest.
- `blkio::serve` then publishes what the device actually said, and the
  unknown reaches `MountRecord::medium() == None`, where the generic drive
  icon is the right answer *by design* instead of by coincidence.

**Done when:** no layer can publish a class its device did not declare; a
regression test composes an array over a member with an unreadable class
word and asserts both halves — the composition is served the cautious
envelope, and its mount reports `medium() == None`; and `served_as` remains
the only place an unknown is turned into a concrete envelope (§2.2).

## D22 — `netstack-dhcp-qemu-riscv64` stall: an unbounded device wait — DONE

**State:** fixed. The mechanism was a guest-side stall, not a budget of the
wrong shape: the in-kernel virtio completion wait could not expire, so a
single unobserved completion parked the boot task **inside** a disk request
while it held that disk's lock. `/System`'s mount and the driver-store service
sit behind the same lock, which is why the guest went silent for the rest of
the run at exactly the point `devmgr` reported the catalogue missing.

**How the two candidates were separated.** The measurement D22 asked for,
done on the same 22-thread host:

- A lone run's *guest* phase (excluding its build) completes the whole
  campaign in **under 6 s**, so the 360 s budget carried ~60× headroom, not
  the ~12× the earlier "~30 s" figure (which included the build) suggested.
- Under deliberate 2× host oversubscription (44 spinners on 22 threads) the
  guest phase stretched to ~54 s — about **7×** — and still **passed**, ten
  consecutive times. Starvation of the magnitude needed to blow a 60× margin
  is therefore not what the pipeline produces.
- The failing transcript's last line is `id=13005`, i.e. the guest fell silent
  ~355 s before the kill. A proportionally-starved guest would have kept
  narrating its boot; a stalled one is silent, which is what was observed.

**The defect.** `KernelVirtioHost::notify_wait` waited with `u64::MAX` — no
deadline at all — and `IrqParkWaiter` only registered a timed wake for callers
that used its own `park_wait`, so a virtio wait parked on the line *alone*.
Any completion the driver did not observe (a lost or coalesced interrupt) left
the task parked forever, holding `SharedBlock`'s lock. The sibling
bootstrap-floor driver already had this right: the SDHCI engine waits with
`EMMC2_SILENCE_BUDGET_NS` and fails the transfer closed, precisely so a dead
controller cannot become "a task parked forever holding the volume's lock".
The virtio path — which every Tier-1 target except the Pi actually boots
from — never got the same treatment.

**Fix (landed).**

- The wait loop hands its deadline to every park (`IrqWaiter::yield_now` takes
  `deadline_ns`), so a bounded wait is releasable by construction rather than
  when a caller remembers to arm one. `IrqParkWaiter`'s private
  deadline field is gone with the bookkeeping it existed for.
- `VirtioHost::notify_wait(queue_index, timeout_ns) -> CompletionSignal`: the
  caller states its budget and learns whether the device signalled or stayed
  silent. A driver with a request outstanding passes its device class's
  per-request deadline; an idle input driver waiting for an unsolicited event
  still passes `u64::MAX`, which is correct for a wait with nothing pending.
- `virtio_blk` fails a silent request closed with `DriverError::DeviceOffline`
  after one final ring re-scan, and never reissues in place (the device may
  still own the published chain). The wake-storm bound stays as it was.
- `CompletionSignal` is now one ABI vocabulary in `lib/abi`, shared by both
  floor storage drivers; eMMC2's private copy was deleted.
- The harness no longer conflates two failures: a gated run that reaches its
  ceiling reports `UNCONFIRMED … guest silent for Ns` (`GateNeverTripped`)
  instead of a bare `TIMEOUT`. The silence at the kill is the number that
  separates "alive but never confirmed" from "stalled at a fixed point", so a
  recurrence diagnoses itself instead of needing this investigation again. The
  comment claiming gated guests chatter (which is why silence was not read as
  the signal) was false and is corrected: they park silently on their
  wait-set, and the host peer retries every 500 ms indefinitely.

**Not** fixed by a budget bump: the 360 s budget is unchanged, and the earlier
240 → 360 s raise is exactly the mitigation that let this hide.

**Regression cover.** `a_silent_device_times_out_instead_of_waiting_forever`
and `the_callers_budget_reaches_the_park` (`kernel/virtio`),
`a_silent_device_fails_closed_with_device_offline` (`virtio_blk`),

## D41 — the root-unlock console read failed under a loaded gate — CLOSED (the route is unreachable by construction)

**State:** closed. Not closed as a load flake, and not closed on a green
re-run: the failing condition has exactly two reachable causes, and **both
are now foreclosed structurally** on the two ports that carry this vertical.
The half of this entry that was recorded as an open question is answered
outright; the half that is not is stated as unattributed rather than guessed.

**The symptom**, once, during a `cargo xtask ci` run whose QEMU verticals
overlapped the pipeline's own image builds:

```
id=4138 root-unlock: gave up; no users database installed (reboot required)
        cause=console_unreadable
id=4139 root-unlock: gave up fail-closed; login refused until reboot
id=5004 syscall rejected ... comm=login sc=users_db_read err=12
id=5004 syscall rejected ... comm=login sc=fs_open err=12
id=10006 console error task=8 stage=username errno=7
```

**Answered: which of the four came first.** `err=12` is
`Errno::NotImplemented`, and for `users_db_read` and `fs_open` that is the
fail-closed answer of the inert `NULL_USERS_DB` / `NULL_FILESYSTEM` holders a
boot installs while **no root volume is mounted**. The unlock giving up is
therefore what *causes* the three refusals behind it — they are consequences,
not a shared fourth cause. The entry no longer has to ask.

**So the defect is `cause=console_unreadable` alone**, which
`read_passphrase_line` (`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/root_mount.rs`) reports for
exactly two conditions: the reader returned `Err`, or it returned a
zero-length read on a line with no content.

**Both conditions are unreachable from the production unlock reader.** The
interactive unlock reads through `KthreadConsoleRead` over the port's
console-0 read half, and on both ports carrying this vertical that half is
backed by a `ConsoleInputQueue` whose `read` is infallible (`Ok(drain(buf))`):
aarch64 `VIDEO_KEYBOARD`, or `UART_CONSOLE_READ` through
`poll_and_read_uart` → `UART_INPUT`; x86_64 `COM1_CONSOLE_READ` through
`poll_and_read_com1` → `COM1_INPUT`. `KthreadConsoleRead` never returns a
zero read for a non-empty buffer either — it polls, parks on
`CONSOLE_WAITQ`, and re-polls, re-resolving its own scheduler id each
iteration. So neither the `Err` route nor the short-read route exists.

**Unattributed: which change removed it.** The console and park machinery was
reworked substantially in this window — D44's live-CPU park fix in the
sibling `BlockingConsoleRead`, `KthreadConsoleRead`'s per-iteration reader-id
re-resolution, interrupt-driven receive arming for the unlock window, and
D62's keyed wakes — and the original was never reproduced, so attributing it
to one of those would be a guess. It is closed on the structural property,
not on a named commit.

**What a future change must not regress**, since that property is the
closure: the unlock reader must stay one that *parks* for input rather than
reporting a short read, over a backing that cannot fail. A console-0 read
half that can return `Err` under load, or a reader that answers zero on an
empty queue, re-opens this defect — it turns a slow console into a
fail-closed refusal of login until reboot.

**The fail-closed `Console` arm is still correct, not dead.**
`ConsoleRead::read` may return `Err` by contract, and one port relies on
that: riscv64's console-0 read half is deliberately the read-less
`NULL_CONSOLE_READ`, so its first passphrase read errors and the unlock gives
up at once rather than parking forever on input that cannot arrive. That is a
documented port decision, not this defect.

**Not the font work that surfaced it.** Fonts changed the image payload and
`login` starts the font service, so the coupling was worth ruling out; the
failure is in the console read path, which the font payload does not touch.

## D23 — the debug FIQ self-sample corrupted the exception-return window

Status: **done**. Reported as a hard lock while running the desktop on
`images/tairix-aarch64-rpi-debug.img` under `qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt`
with four vCPUs, ~18 s after launching a second `files.app` window:

```
id=4082 cpu hard lockup detected cpu=3 observer=1 stalled_ms=10044
        context=kernel sampled=pre_silence
id=4085 cpu lockup diagnostic detail cpu=3 observer=1 pc=+0x00000000001ee840
        pstate=0x0000000060000385 k_site=user_switch k_seq=38818
        k_lock=kernel/sched/cfq/src/scheduler.rs k_lock_line=753
        k_lock_state=held k_bt=+0x00000000001ee840
id=4084 cpu lockup recovery requested cpu=3 kind=hard outcome=attention
```

**Reading the record.** `pc=+0x1ee840` resolves (image base `0x80000`) to
`tairix_aarch64_trap_common+0xb0` — the instruction *two* past the
`msr SPSR_EL1` in the trampoline's return epilogue. `pstate` decodes to EL1h
with `I`/`A`/`D` masked and **`F` clear**, so the only asynchronous exception
that could be taken there was an FIQ: on this board the boot probe reports
Group 0 deliverable, and the sync handler clears `DAIF.F` so a wedged core
can be sampled. The record is therefore not a coincidence — it is the
sampler catching itself in the act, one instruction before the damage.

**Mechanism.** `ELR_EL1` and `SPSR_EL1` are single-copy: taking an exception
overwrites both. The epilogue programmed them and then ran ~40 further
instructions (`SP_EL0`, FPCR/FPSR, `q0`–`q31`, the GP restores, `add sp`)
before its `eret`. An FIQ in that window returns through its own handler,
which restores *its* saved pair, so the victim's `eret` resumes the epilogue
itself at EL1 with the frame already popped: each turn restores garbage from
the stack above and adds another 816 bytes to `sp`, walking off the kernel
stack until a load faults, and the fault then recurs with `DAIF` masked — a
silent, unrecoverable wedge that never reaches the panic printer, which is
why the log ends without diagnostics.

**Reachability is narrow and exact.** Only a `watchdog-diagnostics` build on a
single-Security-state GIC routes the cadence to FIQ, so the window is live on
the **debug image under QEMU** and nowhere else: a shippable image never
clears `DAIF.F` in the kernel, and a real Pi 4's GIC-400 probes `Unsupported`.
The QEMU integration verticals do not enable the feature either, so D15's
freeze is *not* this defect. D16's Pi-4 wedge shares the `k_site=user_switch`
breadcrumb but not the cause (it is I-cache/fault-handling, fixed there).

**The sibling ports are structurally unaffected**, so there is no common
logic to hoist: x86_64's `iretq` consumes its return state from the *stack*,
which a nested interrupt pushes below rather than overwriting, and riscv64's
epilogue restores `sstatus` (whose `SIE` is clear in every saved frame)
*before* `sepc`, with the syscall body re-masking on the way out and no
non-maskable channel wired. The hazard is specific to a return state held in
single-copy system registers that an asynchronous exception also writes.

**Fix.** Both of the port's `eret` sequences now close the window: the
trampoline epilogue (`vectors.s`) and the EL0 entry (`userentry::enter_el0`)
`msr DAIFSet, #0xf` before programming the return state. `eret` reloads PSTATE
from `SPSR_EL1`, so the mask never reaches the resumed context and EL0 still
runs preemptible. The masked span is straight-line, lock-free and MMIO-free,
so the sampler loses no coverage that could ever wedge (`plans/WATCHDOG.md`
B4).

**Regression cover.** `kernel/arch/aarch64::exceptions::eret_tests` pins the
ordering against both sources — mask before the `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1` write,
nothing re-enabling before the `eret`. Verified to fail on the pre-fix source
and pass after. The race itself cannot be entered deterministically from a
target test, and the assertion is the source-level invariant that makes the
sequence correct, so the source pin is the regression guard rather than a
QEMU vertical.

## D40 — a mutating memory syscall re-froze the whole address space

**State:** closed. Every syscall and fault path that knows which pages it
changed now publishes those, and only the two batch paths that genuinely
cannot name them re-freeze.

**Mechanism.** The registry holds a frozen `Send + Sync` snapshot of a task's
mappings for the user-copy path. `AddressSpace::freeze` rebuilds it by walking
the page table and allocating a fresh `BTreeMap` node for **every resident
page of the task**, and `tairix_kalloc` places a node by scanning its free
list (`carve` first-fit, `insert_hole` sorted insert). A wholesale re-freeze
therefore costs *resident pages × hole count* — the "O(N²), tens of seconds
under emulation" the `note_faulted_page` doc already named for the fault path
— and the kernel is non-preemptible, so the CPU's dispatch loop makes no
progress for the whole call.

**Report it explains.** A desktop under QEMU `virt` (4 vCPUs, aarch64 debug
image) froze with cpu 0 inside a single `mem_unmap`: `k_site=syscall
k_detail=0xf` (`MEM_UNMAP`), `k_seq` identical across two reports 0.73 s apart
(one call, not a loop), `stalled_ms=10000 context=kernel`. The soft record
carried no `observer`, so it came from `check_stall` on cpu 0's **own** timer
tick — the core was still taking maskable interrupts while making no dispatch
progress, which is a long in-kernel computation, not a lock or a wedge.

**Fix.** Every path that knows *which* pages changed publishes them as
in-place deltas (`AddressSpaceRegistry::note_faulted_page`) instead, through
one pair in `kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`: `publish_region_mapping` (resolves
each page's `(frame, flags)` from the live space) and
`publish_region_teardown` (removes them). A snapshot that cannot absorb a
delta falls back to the wholesale re-freeze, so the delta is never a
correctness dependency.

Who publishes what: `mem_unmap`, `file_unmap`, `shm_unmap` and `dma_free`
drop the region they released; `shm_create`, `shm_map`, `mmio_map` and
`dma_alloc` publish the region they mapped; the anonymous, file-backed and
compressed-page faults publish the one page they backed, and stack growth the
range it committed. `mem_map` and `file_map` publish **nothing** — a
reservation commits no frame and writes no page-table entry, so the snapshot
is unchanged by construction — and `shm_grant` / `call_grant` publish nothing
because they mint a grant and map no page (the earlier *Remaining* list named
these three in error). `sharedreg::unmap`, `DmaPool::free_at`,
`LiveUserSpace::free_dma` and `DmaAllocFacility::free` gained a released-length
return, because those were the only two releases whose caller did not already
hold the extent.

Only the two genuinely unnameable batches still re-freeze: the ramzip
warm/cluster restore and the direct-reclaim sweep, each of which moves several
pages at once and reports no list.

Removing by delta also closes a **fail-open** hole: the wholesale re-freeze is
a documented no-op when no live space is published on the current CPU, so a
released region's pages stayed translating in the snapshot the copy path
walks — reachable memory the task no longer owns, whose frames the allocator
is free to hand to another task. The regression test
(`mem_unmap_drops_the_released_pages_from_the_snapshot`) drives exactly that
case and fails on the pre-fix source with "a released page must not stay
reachable through the snapshot".

**What the mapping half cost, and where it showed.** These were staged as
"one-shot window setups", which underrated them: the desktop session maps a
frame region for **every window an app opens**, so a `terminal.app` context
menu — a popup window — paid four of these (the app's `shm_create` and
`shm_grant`, the session's `shm_map`, then both unmaps) against the largest
address space on the machine. That is the ~300 ms per menu open and close
reported on a Pi 4B, and it is invisible under QEMU because the session's
resident set there is a fraction of a 1080p one. Reading the same class found
two more instances: `resolve_file_fault` re-froze per faulted page, making an
N-page file mapping O(N²) to read (the very hazard the anonymous path's delta
existed to avoid), and stack growth re-froze after committing a range it had
just computed.

**Regression cover (mapping half).**
`shm_map_and_unmap_publish_only_the_regions_own_pages`: a task with 64
resident pages maps and unmaps a one-page shared region and must end with a
snapshot of exactly three pages and **zero** whole-space freezes. Fails on the
pre-fix source with `(true, 67)` — the whole resident set the rebuild
imported.

Also unfixed, and **separate**: the same report's `id=4082 cpu hard lockup
detected cpu=0 observer=1 … sampled=pre_silence stuck_irq=77` is a
**misclassification**. cpu 0 was demonstrably still taking maskable
interrupts, so it was not silent to interrupts at all; only its Group-0/FIQ
liveness cadence had stopped. `DAIF.F` is masked by exception entry and is
re-cleared only on a *sync* entry, so an interrupt that preempts an EL0 task
carries the mask across the context switch into the dispatcher and every
in-kernel body it then runs — the debug sampler goes blind there, `last_seen_ns`
goes stale, and the buddy detector reports a hard lockup with a `stuck_irq`
story read live from the GIC that has nothing to do with the real stall. The
detector is honest about what it measured; the *channel* it measures is not
always deliverable. Fixing this means re-establishing the probed FIQ posture
after an interrupt-driven preemptive switch (aarch64 `preempt`/`kthread` switch
path), so a soft stall can never be dressed up as a hard lockup.

## D25 — a nested reader on the address-space registry wedged three CPUs — DONE

**State:** fixed. `terminal_size`'s pty-slave arm held an `aspaces` **reader**
across `with_caller_aspace`, which takes a second reader on that same lock.
`tairix_sync::RwLock` is writer-preference — `read()` blocks while
`pending_writers > 0`, and `write()` registers its intent *before* draining
readers — so the inner acquisition is refused the moment any other CPU calls
`aspaces.write()`, and the outer guard it is nested inside is exactly what that
writer waits for. Neither side can ever be granted, and every later
`aspaces.read()` (`stream_read`'s among them) queues behind the pending writer.
A `RwLockReadGuard` is a value with a `Drop` impl, so the outer borrow lives to
the end of its block, not to its last use.

**Report it explains.** A desktop under QEMU `virt` (4 vCPUs, aarch64 debug
image) froze with cpu 0 in `k_site=syscall k_detail=0xd` (`STREAM_READ`) and
cpu 3 in `k_site=user_switch`, both with `k_seq` identical across the soft and
hard records — one call each, no loop. `k_lock=scheduler.rs:753 k_lock_state=held`
is *not* diagnostic: that is `task.body.lock()`, legitimately held for the whole
off-CPU lifetime of any parked task. The accompanying `stuck_irq=77
stuck_state=pending` (the virtio mouse, mmio slot 29) is a consequence: every
device SPI is routed to cpu 0 alone (`CPU0_TARGET`), so a wedged cpu 0 leaves
its lines asserted and untaken. As under D40, the hard-lockup label and its
live-GIC `stuck_irq` story are the misclassification described there, not the
mechanism.

**Fix.** The arm takes the owned geometry bytes and releases the reader before
the copy-out, so no acquisition of that lock nests. An audit of all 25
held-guard `aspaces` sites found this to be the only nesting and no AB-BA cycle
(`record_fault_exit` already drops its `aspaces` reader before taking `caps`);
the ~186 immediate-drop `self.aspaces.read().method()` forms cannot nest by
construction.

**Why it hid.** `RwLock` reported nothing to the lockup watchdog, while
`SpinLock` publishes its whole acquire/hold/release lifecycle, so a CPU
spinning in `read()`/`write()` was invisible and the report named a stale
spinlock site instead. `RwLock` now mirrors `SpinLock` through the same
`lockwatch` seam, and its rustdoc states the recursive-read prohibition.

**Also fixed, same path.** `parked_stream_read` polled before registering on
the stream wait-queue, and a stream wake latches nothing — a peer producing
bytes between the poll and the registration woke nobody, so the reader parked
on data that had already arrived. It now registers before the first poll and stays
registered until the loop exits, matching `BlockingConsoleRead::read_until`.

**Regression cover.** Six `lib/sync` tests pin the grant/refuse semantics and
guard-drop release that make nesting fatal. Neither interleaving is reachable
from a host test — there is no controllable point between the two acquisitions,
nor between the poll and the registration — and a timing-based thread test
would be the load-dependent flake the charter forbids, so the source-level
invariant is the guard, as for D23.

## D26 — a mouse scroll produced no input event at all (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** QEMU's HID pointers report a wheel detent as an `EV_KEY`
`BTN_GEAR_DOWN`/`BTN_GEAR_UP` (`0x150`/`0x151`) press and release rather than
as `EV_REL`/`REL_WHEEL`, and nothing accepted those codes — the pointer-button
range is `0x110..0x113` — so every detent was discarded. The two encodings that
did decode, `evdev`'s `REL_WHEEL` and the USB HID wheel byte, count rotation
away from the user and were passed through unnegated onto an axis that counts
downward, so they scrolled backwards.

**Fix.** `lib/virtio_input`'s `decode_event` maps a gear press to one `Scroll`
detent on `AXIS_Y` (down `+1`, up `-1`), drops its release, and negates
`REL_WHEEL`; `lib/hid`'s boot-mouse decode negates the wheel byte. Every
encoding now lands on the axis `lib/abi`'s `InputEventKind::Scroll` states — a
positive `Y` is a detent toward the user, scrolling toward the end — and reaches
the seat through the one `PointerInput::from_device_event` mapping, with a
decode test per encoding. A horizontal wheel still never arrives from QEMU,
which drops it host-side.

## D27 — ARXFS has no persistent deduplication index

**State:** open, correctness-safe.

**Mechanism.** The dedupe index (`drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/dedupe.rs`) is
an in-RAM bounded LRU cache keyed by `(domain, length, logical hash)`, warmed
only by the writes of the current mount. The chunk tree it is checked against
is keyed by physical block, not by hash, so a hash lookup cannot fall back to
it. A duplicate written in an earlier mount session is therefore not found
until the cache warms again in the new session — reduced cross-mount
deduplication effectiveness, never a wrong merge (a missed duplicate is
correctness-safe; the data is simply stored twice, `arxfs-spec.md` §9).

**Fix direction.** A persistent, hash-keyed dedupe tree committed in the
transaction root, so a lookup survives a remount without walking the chunk
tree. Structural and larger than a single change: a new authoritative
on-disk structure, not an extension of the existing rebuildable cache.

---

## D28 — ARXFS per-transaction deferred-free and pending-mark sets were unbounded (FIXED)

**Where.** `drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/allocator.rs`, `lib.rs`'s free and
transaction paths, and `discard.rs`.

**Mechanism.** Every set a transaction kept about blocks was a set of
*blocks*: `txn_freed` (a `BTreeSet<u64>`) held every block released until the
commit, the map's `pending` (a `BTreeMap<u64, bool>`) held every bit change
whose page or summary block was not resident, and the per-operation undo
records (`op_claimed`, `op_released`, `op_deferred`, `txn_private`) held one
entry per block too. So deleting a very large file allocated memory
proportional to the file's block count — 2.5×10^10 entries for a 100 TB file at
4 KiB — reached by an ordinary `rm`, and hopeless against the small-RAM /
large-volume floor (`AGENTS.md` §26.7). The release path was per-block in *time*
as well: `release_block_ref` asked the chunk tree about every block of an
extent, one B-tree descent each, and the commit then applied one map bit change
per block.

**Fix (item D28 of `plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`).** One ordered set
of runs held maximally coalesced, with `insert` / `remove` / `contains` and the
two walk primitives `first_overlap` / `first_gap` — since
`plans/COLLECTIONS.md` C5 the shared `tairix_collections::RangeSet` — replaces
every one of those sets, so the bookkeeping costs one
entry per contiguous run a transaction touches. An extent is contiguous by
construction, so releasing a file costs its extent count. Three paths became
run-wise with it:

- **The map.** One `apply_run` walks the *pages* a run spans and sets or clears
  whole bytes of each, moving the free count and each page summary by the bits
  that actually changed; the infallible `mark_run_used` / `mark_run_free` change
  every resident page and defer the remainder as runs (`pending_used` /
  `pending_free`, disjoint, so the latest mark over a block is the only one).
  `map_find_free_run`'s inline scan is gone: both it and `trim` now step on one
  `map_first_free_run` primitive.
- **The release.** `release_data_run` walks the chunk tree by *range* — the new
  `btree_get_ceil`, the mirror of the existing floor query — so the unshared
  part of a run is freed as a run and only a genuinely shared block costs a
  refcount edit. The tail free hands it whole runs instead of looping per block,
  and a directory's mirrored content run is one free of `len + 1` blocks.
- **The queue and the cluster cache.** `pending_discard` holds coalesced runs
  (capped on runs, its actual memory, as `MAX_PENDING_DISCARD_RUNS`), `trim`
  splits each against the live map instead of sorting and coalescing a block
  list, and the `ClusterCache` seam takes `invalidate_run(phys, len)` so one
  extent free is one call.

*Measured (`tests/bounded_iteration.rs`).* Truncating a contiguous file to zero
holds **10 352** bytes over **35** allocations and removing it **11 376** over
**52** — identical at 400 blocks and at 1 600, where the per-block set and its
per-block chunk lookups scaled with the file.

**Also fixed, found by the same reading.** `Extent::decode` accepted a stored
run that could not exist on the device, so the tail free's `start + ext.len`
overflowed on a corrupt-but-authentic record: in release it wrapped to a small
end, the extent read as wholly below the cut, and the truncate left the tail
mapped while `inode.size` said it was gone; in debug it panicked. Decode
now refuses a run that does not fit `total_blocks` — which is also what makes
every later `phys + offset` and every run length handed to the map total — and
the logical end is saturating, so a run reaching the end of the address space
cuts *less* than it names rather than more.

**What remained** — a maximally fragmented very large file, whose extent count
is itself unbounded, still accumulated one run per extent inside one
transaction — is D67 below, and is fixed.

---

## D67 — an ARXFS delete was not incremental, so a maximally fragmented very large file was unbounded (FIXED)

**Where.** `drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/lib.rs` (`shrink_tail_step`,
`drop_name`, `drain_pending_deletes`, `truncate_file`, the transaction
lifecycle), `src/transaction.rs`, `src/allocator.rs`, `src/check.rs`.

**Mechanism.** D28 made a transaction's block bookkeeping proportional to the
*runs* it releases rather than the blocks, which is what an ordinary delete
needs. It did not make the operation *incremental*: the whole-inode and tail
frees ran to completion inside one transaction, so the run count they
accumulated was the extent count of what they freed. A file the allocator
laid out contiguously has one extent; a maximally fragmented one on a 100 TB
volume can have of the order of 10^10, so a single `rm` still asked for memory
the small-RAM floor (`AGENTS.md` §26.7) cannot give it, and the operation was
uninterruptible besides (§26.6).

**Fix (item D67 of `plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`).** Freeing spans
transactions, behind on-disk state:

- **The pending-delete set.** The transaction root names a tree keyed by inode
  number — a *set*, its record the key alone — holding every inode whose last
  name has gone and whose blocks are not all freed. `unlink` removes the name
  and names the inode in the set in **one** bounded transaction; the freeing
  continues in further ones. A writable mount finishes the set before it serves
  a request, a read-only mount leaves it alone, and `check` reclaims an orphan
  by the same route rather than freeing it inside its own pass. The set is
  authoritative metadata: the free-space rebuild walks its nodes and scrub
  verifies them. It needs no incompatible-feature bit, because a reader that did
  not understand it would leave the inodes it names unreachable and allocated —
  exactly the orphan `check` reclaims — and could never misread live data.
- **Freeing descends.** One `shrink_tail_step` replaces both old paths and takes
  the highest extent first, lowering `inode.size` to the boundary each freed
  extent exposes. That is what makes a step publishable: every intermediate
  state on the medium is a *shorter file*, never one of the original length with
  holes where its data had been, which is what freeing upward from the cut would
  have left after a crash. So `truncate` needs no set entry at all — an
  interrupted one is consistent, merely unfinished.
- **One ceiling.** A step stops on an extent boundary once the transaction has
  reached the write-back ceiling (WB5), the same ceiling the write path yields
  to. For that to bound a *free*, the ceiling had to count the transaction's run
  bookkeeping alongside its staged blocks: freeing a fragmented file dirties a
  spine's worth of blocks whatever its extent count while the runs grow one per
  extent, so a ceiling over the blocks alone would not have bitten at all. At
  least one extent goes before the ceiling is consulted, so progress is
  unconditional and no caller can spin. An ordinary delete is still exactly one
  transaction, because the operation that detaches the name takes the first step
  itself.

*Measured (`tests/bounded_iteration.rs`).* Deleting a maximally fragmented file
holds **88 600** bytes at 1 200 extents and **110 368** at 4 800 — the ceiling,
not the file. Freeing the same file inside one transaction holds **448 448** at
1 200 extents and **626 312** at 2 400, growing with it.

**Also fixed, found by the same work.** A stale handle could hard-link a node
whose last name had gone, putting a live name on blocks the reclaim was about to
free; `link` now refuses a node with no names left, and the reclaim itself drops
a set entry whose inode still has names rather than freeing under one — a
contradiction only a damaged volume can produce, and the reclaim loses the space
rather than the data. `Extent::decode` accepted a zero-length run, which no
write path produces and on which the downward tail free would have stopped,
reporting a tree it had emptied while the record still stood and leaving its
nodes allocated once the inode went; it is refused, and the reclaim additionally
refuses to free an inode whose extent root survived. A directory's intermediate
size was computed from the data capacity rather than the whole metadata block,
so one stride is now derived per kind in one place and `dir_block_count` reads
it. `inode_spec` carried a hand-written copy of the inode tree's owner sentinel
where the reserved-owner enum already defines it. `NodeTrail`'s subtree-closing
half lost its last consumer with the bulk tree free and is deleted.

## D29 — a CPU-bound user task was never sampled, so a healthy core was reported hard-locked

**State:** done. Reported from the field: opening the Switchboard window on the
`virt` debug image "often" produced a lockup record in the debug log.

**Mechanism.** The debug image's liveness cadence is delivered as a Group-0
**FIQ** (the probe answers `Supported` on the single-Security-state `virt` GIC,
`plans/WATCHDOG.md` B2), but the port entered EL0 with `DAIF.F` **set**. A task
running in user mode therefore could not take the cadence at all: the FIQ could
only land during a kernel entry, so a core executing a CPU-bound user task went
unsampled for as long as the task ran. `last_seen_ns` kept the stamp of the last
kernel entry, aged past the 10 s hard threshold, and a buddy reported `id=4080`
→ `id=4082` → `id=4084` against a core that was demonstrably alive and taking
thousands of IRQs. Because the stale sample also froze `wd_ctx_in_kernel`,
`k_site`, `k_bt` and `k_lock` at that unrelated kernel entry, the record read
exactly like a real kernel wedge — the field report's `k_site=syscall`,
`k_lock=…/cfq/src/scheduler.rs:753 k_lock_state=held`,
`sampled=pre_silence` were all stale, not the cause. Two further consequences:
the soft detector mis-fired for the same reason (`classify` reports a stall only
for a CPU *last seen in the kernel*, which a rotting flag satisfies), and
`monopolises_cpu` — the guard against a task withholding the CPU, which fires
only on a *user*-context sample — was unreachable on the one configuration that
has the sampler.

Nothing about the Switchboard is special: any user task that stays in EL0 for
~10 s does it. The window's first paint (glyph rasterisation, chart and icon
drawing) is simply long enough under TCG.

**Why "often" and not "always" — the tickless interaction.** The trigger is a
core running a *lone* runnable user task. Being tickless, the scheduler disarms
the preemption one-shot when a task is the only runnable one on its CPU, so that
core takes **no** kernel entry at all and the pending cadence FIQ has no window
to land in. Put several runnable tasks on the same core and every preemption tick
is a kernel entry that lets the FIQ through, so the cadence still lands and
nothing is reported — measured: `stress --cpu 20` (20 spinners over 4 vCPUs) is
**clean even before the fix**, while `stress --cpu 1` reports 4/4. That is why
the defect looked intermittent and why it is the *idle-ish desktop* case — one
busy app, everything else parked — that shows it.

**Fix.** `kernel/arch/aarch64/src/userentry.rs` decides the EL0 entry `SPSR`
once, from the boot probe: `el0_spsr(fiq_cadence)` clears `DAIF.F` when
`watchdog::fiq_cadence_enabled()` is true, and is otherwise the unchanged
F-masked value — so a shippable image (no FIQ routed at all) and a board whose
probe answered `Unsupported` behave exactly as before (fail closed). Every later
return to EL0 restores the `SPSR` this entry established from the frame
`vectors.s` saved, so there is one definition of the EL0 mask state.
`plans/WATCHDOG.md` B1's "the EL0 `SPSR` stays F-masked (nested-FIQ-unsafe)" was
an over-generalisation from the two windows where nesting is genuinely unsafe
(`halt_current_cpu`, the FIQ arm itself) and is corrected there: EL0 is not
inside an FIQ handler, the FIQ vector runs on `SP_EL1` with F re-masked by the
PE, both `eret` sequences already mask asynchronous exceptions before
programming the return state (D23/B4), and interrupted user code holds no kernel
lock — an EL0 sample is strictly safer than a kernel-section one. The
diagnostic path needed no change: a non-kernel `pc` is omitted rather than
disclosed raw, and the frame walk rejects a user return address and a
below-floor frame pointer, so an EL0 sample yields one honest entry and cannot
fault.

**Evidence (A/B on the same tree, two kernels differing only in this
condition).** `stress --cpu 1 --timeout 30s` after a scripted unlock + login on
the 4-vCPU `virt` debug image: **before**, 4/4 runs produced the reported
`4080`/`4082`/`4084`/`4085` set, and a per-CPU FIQ-delivery census (QEMU `-d
int`) showed the spinner's core taking **1** sample while its idle siblings took
~46, with thousands of IRQs delivered to it throughout — the core was never
wedged; **after**, 10/10 runs clean. A live register dump during the reported
"lockup" showed the accused core in `EL0t` with `PSTATE.I` clear and its PC
advancing. `stress --cpu 20 --timeout 40s` is clean on **both** kernels, for the
tickless reason above.

**Regression cover.** `userentry`'s host tests pin both `SPSR` values, that only
the F bit differs between them, that EL0t/IRQ-unmasked/SError+Debug-masked hold
either way, and that an unprobed or shippable build keeps F masked. The
`fiq_selfsample_qemu_aarch64` vertical additionally asserts on the real board
that a `Supported` probe leaves the EL0 entry state F-clear, so the two cannot
drift apart again.

## D30 — the pinned-bar screendump was captured before the panel was painted — DONE

`tairix-test-taskbar-pin-qemu-aarch64` now passes in ~22 s.

**Not a geometry defect.** Both sides already agreed: the Switchboard asks only
for a *size* (`Desktop::window_size`), and the session alone places the window
through the one shared `cascade_origin_for` rule the assertion also reads. The
panel was destined for exactly the slot the checker sampled.

**The real cause — the same shared-rendezvous ordinal D31 names.** The guest
announced "panel created and painted" on the *second* reply served over
`WINDOW_ENDPOINT`, a count whose doc claimed it was "a sequence position, not
an open-ended tally of somebody else's traffic". That stopped being true when
the Switchboard gained a start-up `QueryDesktop`: the sequence became
query, create, present, so the marker fired on the **create** — one full round
trip before the panel had drawn anything — and the screendump caught an empty
cascade slot on an otherwise passing guest.

**Fix.** The witness is anchored, not counted. The guest recognises the panel's
own **create** reply by its distinctive wire length
(`WINDOW_CREATE_REPLY_LEN`), and the reply after it completes the present that
first drew the panel. No call added ahead of create — by this client or any
other sharing the rendezvous — can move the gate.

**Diagnosability defect fixed alongside.** The register's own "next step" asked
for a serial log the runner could not produce: `Outcome::Pass` discarded the
transcript, so a *screendump* assertion failing after a passing guest reported
a pixel ratio and nothing else. A pass now carries its transcript like every
other outcome, and the matrix persists it whenever a dump assertion or a link
peer's verdict fails.

---

## D31 — a QEMU vertical whose guest stays chatty ran unbounded — DONE

Two independent defects; both fixed. `tairix-test-autoload-input-qemu-aarch64`
now passes in ~26 s.

**1. The stalled choreography: a gate another component could satisfy.** The
in-window click waited for "a reply over `WINDOW_ENDPOINT`", but every client
of that shared rendezvous replies on it. The Switchboard's start-up
`QueryDesktop` (`userland/gui/switchboard` asks the session to describe the
desktop before it sizes anything) fires that gate ~0.5 s before the files
window is created, so the click landed on bare desktop, no window event was
ever delivered, and every later stage — which counted *system-wide*
`MessageDelivered` records — could never advance.

The AW3 stage is now on the same footing D19/D20 put the terminal stage on:
every gate names its own subject. The click waits on the files window's own
**frame map** (`FILES_WINDOW_FRAME_MAPS`; only a window *create* maps a frame,
so no query, present or reply can advance it), and the two former cumulative
counts are guest markers the test kernel emits from the destination **port** of
each delivery (`FILES_WINDOW_ACTIVATED_MARKER`, `FILES_HANDSHAKE_MARKER`), so
another app's or service's traffic cannot move them. No cumulative
`MessageDelivered` threshold remains in the vertical.

**2. An inactivity budget cannot bound a run.** `Spec::timeout` is the longest
a guest may fall *silent*; a guest that keeps printing resets it forever, so a
stalled choreography degraded into an unbounded pipeline hang instead of a
failure — here the desktop's own ~1 Hz refresh was enough. Every run now also
carries an absolute wall-clock ceiling (`Spec::runtime_ceiling`, twice the
declared budget, so each test still declares one number) and reports
`Outcome::RuntimeCeilingExceeded` with the silence at the kill, which
distinguishes a live-but-unfinished guest from one that stalled and went
quiet. The parallel runner also prints every job's completion and duration, so
an outstanding job is visible in the log rather than inferred from its absence.

---

## D32 — CPU 0 never returned to the dispatch loop, so every deferred wake stranded and the desktop froze (OPEN)

**State:** open. Observability and the recovery path have landed; *why the
non-maskable cadence stopped on CPU 0* is not yet determined. Reported from the
field on the aarch64 `virt` debug image, ~150 s into ordinary desktop use.

**Symptom.** The desktop stops responding — no keyboard, no pointer, nothing
repaints — while the log shows a soft stall and then a hard-lockup set against
CPU 0 alone:

```
[169.385] [ERROR] id=4080 cpu stall detected cpu=0 stalled_ms=10000 context=kernel
[169.386] [ERROR] id=4085 cpu lockup diagnostic detail cpu=0 pc=+0x1fae90 pstate=0x20000305 k_site=user_switch k_seq=1181763 k_lock=kernel/sched/cfq/src/scheduler.rs k_lock_line=753 k_lock_state=held
[169.475] [ERROR] id=4082 cpu hard lockup detected cpu=0 observer=2 stalled_ms=10089 context=kernel sampled=pre_silence stuck_irq=77 stuck_state=pending stuck_owner=0x9
[169.476] [WARN]  id=4084 cpu lockup recovery requested cpu=0 kind=hard outcome=attention
```

This is a **real** user-visible hang, not the D29 false positive: that class
reports a core that is demonstrably alive on a machine that stays responsive.
CPUs 1–3 are healthy throughout, but every device SPI is routed to CPU 0 alone
(`CPU0_TARGET`, `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/aarch64/gic_irq.rs`), so a CPU 0 that
stops servicing input freezes the whole session.

**Proven: CPU 0 was alive and taking interrupts.** `id=4080` and `id=4085`
carry **no `observer=` field**, and that identifies the emitter: the summary and
detail renderers emit `observer` only when it is `Some`, `scan` always passes
`Some(observer)`, and `check_stall` passes `None`. `check_stall` is reached only
from the per-arch tick dispatcher — on aarch64 `production_tick_dispatch` via
`handle_irq` → `preempt::on_timer_interrupt` → `TimerHal::dispatch_tick`. CPU 0
therefore took, dispatched and serviced timer PPI 30 at the moment it was
reported stalled.

That arithmetically **excludes an un-EOI'd interrupt**: every enabled line sits
at `MID_RANGE_PRIORITY`, so anything left active would have blocked PPI 30 too.
It also excludes the D13 ISR-shared-`SpinLock` theory — an exhaustive audit found
no plain `SpinLock` reachable from both an ISR and a syscall path (the one
genuinely shared structure, the console RX ring, is correctly gated by the
`IrqSafeSpinLock` `UART_RX_GATE`), and the record says `k_lock_state=held`, not
`acquiring`. An audit of the userland GUI event loops likewise found no
busy-poll.

**Mechanism.** CPU 0 dispatched a task (`k_site=user_switch`, the CFQ body lock
held by design across the whole user run at `kernel/sched/cfq/src/scheduler.rs`
:753) and **never returned to `run_dispatch_loop`**. Both liveness heartbeats
froze within 1 ms of each other at the last dispatch-loop iteration, because
`note_progress`/`note_alive` are stamped only by that loop. Every
interrupt-context wake is deferred by design — the ISR only flags
(`IrqTable::fire` sets `ready`, `WaitQueue::request_wake` sets `wake_pending`)
and the real `wake_all`/`unpark` happens in `drain_pending_wakes()`, **which runs
only from the dispatch loop**. So while CPU 0 stayed out of the loop no deferred
wake was ever delivered: the `virtio_kbd` owner parked on `IRQ_WAITQ` (task 9)
was never unparked, no input reached seatmgr/wm, and the desktop froze.
`stuck_irq=77 stuck_owner=0x9` is the *symptom* of that stranded owner, not the
cause. `sampled=pre_silence` on the `id=4082` record is honest; the `id=4080`
record's confident `context=kernel` was **not** (see Fix 2).

**Why nothing forced CPU 0 back — this is the defect.** Two mechanisms could
have, and both were disarmed:

1. The ordinary preempt point is competitor-gated: `reschedule_owed` returns
   `false` with no runnable competitor and no flagged deferred wake, so a lone
   CPU-bound task keeps the CPU by design.
2. The monopoly safety net rode a channel that had stopped. `request_forced_yield`
   had exactly **one** issuer, `on_watchdog_tick` → `monopolises_cpu`, which
   bailed immediately `if in_kernel` — reading `wd_ctx_in_kernel`, a field
   refreshed **only** by a cadence sample. CPU 0's last sample was taken inside
   `Scheduler::dispatch`, so the field **rotted at `true`** and the guard could
   never fire; and with the ~1 Hz cadence dead on that core, `on_watchdog_tick`
   never ran there at all.

The anti-monopoly guarantee was thus suppressed by exactly the condition it
exists to break, while the one path provably still running on the wedged core —
the maskable timer tick — computed the identical "no dispatch progress for 10 s"
condition in `check_stall` and **only logged it**.

**Fix 1 — the forced yield now rides the timer tick (landed).**
`monopolises_cpu` is split: `progress_overdue(state, now_ns)` is the
`Active` + armed + past-threshold half and takes **no** context argument, and
`monopolises_cpu` is `!in_kernel && progress_overdue(…)` for the cadence caller
that holds a fresh reading. `check_stall` calls `request_forced_yield` whenever
`progress_overdue` holds, read **unlatched** and evaluated independently of the
latched soft-lockup report, so an overdue core is pushed back at every tick
rather than once per episode. The forced-yield latch is consumed by the same
interrupt's return-to-user preempt point and is deliberately not
competitor-gated, so the CPU returns to `run_dispatch_loop`, which drains the
pending wakes, unparks the `IRQ_WAITQ` owner, and restores input. It arms no new
timer, so ticklessness is untouched. Recovery now takes ~1 s (the monopoly
window) instead of never.

**Fix 1b — the EL1 case (landed).** A task wedged in EL1 never reaches a
return-to-user preempt point, and `yield_if_owed_on` consumed only the *tick*
latch, so a forced yield could not be honoured there at all. `preempt_current`
and `yield_if_owed` now share one `honour_latches` decision that consumes both
latches, so a monopoly is broken at whichever boundary the CPU reaches first.

**Fix 2 — the diagnostic no longer lies (landed).** `context=kernel|user` was
rendered from `wd_ctx_in_kernel` unconditionally, even when that field was older
than the cadence interval — so `check_stall`'s report printed a confident
`context=kernel` from a field ten seconds out of date. That misreading cost two
wrong diagnoses of this very defect. A context older than the cadence interval
is now marked `sampled=pre_silence`, exactly as `scan` already did for the hard
path, from one shared `context_stale` predicate.

**Also landed (observability).** The `probe_fiq_deliverability` verdict was
discarded with `let _ =`, making an image whose non-maskable self-sample never
ran indistinguishable in the log from one where it worked; it is now reported
once on the boot CPU as `CpuWatchdogSelfSample` (id 4086, debug-only,
address-free). And because `GICD_ISACTIVER0` is banked per CPU — so an observer
reads its *own* SGI/PPI state, never the victim's, and `first_stuck_spi` scans
SPIs only — each CPU now publishes the interrupt it acknowledged into its own
per-CPU slot and clears it at the EOI, rendered as `in_flight` beside
`stuck_irq`. A core wedged inside a banked SGI or PPI will name it instead of
falling through to an innocent pending SPI.

**Open residual — why the ~1 Hz cadence stopped on CPU 0.** Undetermined. This
is a *detection* failure; Fix 1 makes the freeze recoverable regardless of which
candidate is right, but the candidate must still be found:

1. **`DAIF.F` masked for the window (strongest lead).** `el0_spsr` is applied
   only on **first** EL0 entry (`kernel/arch/aarch64/src/userentry.rs`:125), so a
   task first entered *before* the FIQ probe completed carries `F=1` for its
   whole life — D29's unmask is then inert for that task, exactly as if the probe
   had answered `Unsupported`. Worth its own investigation. The new `id=4086`
   record settles the probe half of the question on the next reproduction.
2. **Priority starvation.** The cadence PPI runs at the deliberately lowest
   `WATCHDOG_FIQ_PRIORITY` (0xC0); sustained 0x80 activity could hold it off.
3. **A missed first re-arm** of the one-shot cadence.

D29 is **not** the explanation for this report: that class is a false positive on
a machine that stays responsive, and this one hangs the desktop.

**Regression cover.** Host: `progress_overdue` fires for a CPU whose
`wd_ctx_in_kernel` has rotted at `true` (pinning that the guard no longer depends
on the rotting field); a context older than the cadence interval renders
`sampled=pre_silence`; an overdue CPU reaches the reschedule path from the
tick channel with no competitor and no latched tick; and a forced yield alone
reaches it through the in-kernel boundary too. All three fail before the fix and
pass after.

**Still needed — the QEMU vertical.** Extend
`tests/integration/preempt_el0_qemu_aarch64` with a **lone** CPU-bound EL0
spinner on one core, no other runnable task on that core, plus a second task
blocked in `irq_wait` on a device line; assert that the dispatch-loop progress
heartbeat advances within the monopoly window **and** that the `irq_wait` owner
is woken while the spinner still runs. It must be a *lone* runnable task, or
`reschedule_owed` short-circuits and the test passes vacuously. Do **not**
repurpose `preempt_inkernel_qemu_aarch64` (D24) or `fiq_selfsample_qemu_aarch64`
(D29).

## D33 — `waitset_wait` was a fixed priority, so a busy source starved every member behind it — DONE

**Symptom.** The desktop's Switchboard monitor became permanently
unresponsive after scrolling and clicking over its window, and sometimes
before its window was ever opened. It never recovered on its own.

**Root cause.** `waitset_wait` scanned members in registration order and
took the first ready one. Most member kinds are level-triggered peeks that
only the owner's own drain clears, so a source with work outstanding is
ready on *every* scan and held the head indefinitely. The desktop session
registers `SeatInput` first, then the window endpoint, the notification and
Switchboard mailboxes, and the child reaper — and it handles one source per
wake by design (`call_recv` blocks, so it must not touch an endpoint it was
not woken for). A hand on the mouse therefore served input and *nothing
else*, for as long as the input kept coming: applications blocked in a
window call hung, exited children went unreaped, and the mailboxes peers
post to filled until their sends began failing `WouldBlock`.

**Fix.** The wait-set registry keeps a resume cursor (`resume_after`) and
rotates the member snapshot to begin just after the member the previous
wait reported (`waitset::members` / `waitset::note_reported`), so every
ready member reaches the head within one lap. The cursor advances only once
the token has actually reached the caller, so a wait that failed to report
costs the member nothing; a member removed meanwhile falls back to
registration order. Registration order still decides within a lap.

**Regression cover.** `waitset_wait_reports_two_ready_members_in_turn`
(`kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`) — two endpoints each holding an undrained
request; four consecutive waits must alternate. It reports the same token
four times without the cursor. Registry-level, in
`kernel/core/src/waitset.rs`:

- `a_fresh_set_scans_in_registration_order`
- `reporting_a_member_moves_the_scan_past_it`
- `the_rotation_is_per_kind_as_well_as_per_id`
- `removing_the_last_reported_member_falls_back_to_registration_order`
- `an_empty_set_rotates_to_nothing`
- `note_reported_is_owner_checked`

## D34 — the tray monitor treated a full session queue as a fault and exited — DONE

**Symptom.** The half of D33 that made the freeze *permanent*: the
Switchboard process was gone, and nothing restarts it. The session relaunches
it only from a fresh capsule press that finds no live instance, and a press
while the exit is still unreaped is held as a pending open aimed at a corpse.

**Root cause.** `Service::cycle` counted every non-`NotFound`,
non-`PermissionDenied` publish refusal towards
`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_PUBLISH_FAILURES` (5). A call endpoint at capacity refuses
the post with `WouldBlock` rather than blocking, so a session that had not
drained its queue for five sample periods (10 s — routine under D33) exhausted
the budget and the monitor exited with `PublishFailed`.

**Fix.** `WouldBlock` is excluded from the budget: it is the transient
back-pressure signal, not evidence of a fault or of an absent session. The
summary stays unacknowledged so the change gate re-offers it on the next
sample — one attempt per period, paced by the sampler, never a retry loop.
The two clean exits still catch the genuinely session-less cases, so orphan
detection is unweakened.

**Regression cover.**
`a_session_that_has_not_drained_its_queue_never_stops_the_service` (20
consecutive refused periods, then delivery on the first accepted one) and
`back_pressure_does_not_clear_the_give_up_budget` (a real fault after a
`WouldBlock` still trips it).

## D35 — an app-ward window event was silently dropped when its mailbox was full — DONE

**The defect.** `RtEventSink::deliver` (`userland/gui/session/src/run.rs`)
was one non-blocking `ipc_send`; on `WouldBlock` the session dropped the
event and never retried. That is right for a pure delta (a wheel tick, a
motion sample) and wrong for everything else: `Resized` left the client
hit-testing and rendering at a size the compositor no longer used, with no
second chance until the next resize; `CloseRequested`, `Focus` and
`Minimized` are state edges with no re-derivation path;
`FilePicked`/`PickCancelled` are one-shot conclusions whose loss left
`WindowServer::pick_pending` set for the life of the window, so that window
could never open another picker. An app did not have to be hung for this:
32 slots is a bounded resource and a slow drain is enough.

**Kernel — `WaitSourceKind::PortRoom` (wire value 10).** The send-side twin
of the `Port` member, so a sender can park on a full destination instead of
dropping or polling. Added by the *send*-authority check `ipc_send` applies
(the caller is the sender, not the binder); an unknown port and one the
caller may not post to give the same oracle-free `NotFound`.

- **Level-triggered, not the edge the original entry proposed.** The member
  is armed *after* a send was refused, so an edge seeded at that moment
  would already have passed if the receiver drained in between — the sender
  would then park forever on an empty mailbox, which is the freeze this
  defect is about. Ready means "a send would not be refused for want of
  room": below capacity, port gone, or send authority lost. The last two
  keep a sender from waiting on something waiting cannot fix, and answering
  ready unconditionally to an unauthorised caller leaks no occupancy.
- **The wake is targeted.** A `Port` records the tasks parked for its room
  (`watch_room`/`unwatch_room`, registered before the first readiness scan
  so a drain in the arming window is not lost), and a *committed*
  `ipc_recv` wakes exactly them. Port teardown broadcasts once, because the
  record dies with the port — the `call_wake`/`call_wake_task` pattern.
  Only a set holding a `PortRoom` member joins the queue.

**Session — the hold-back (`userland/gui/session/src/holdback.rs`).** One
ordered queue per `(destination mailbox, window)`; a destination already
owed something takes the next event unsent, so nothing overtakes what is
queued, and a flush serves an owner's windows round-robin so one window's
backlog starves no sibling. Folding is by what each quantity means: a state
edge replaces the held one in place (at most one of each per window), a
position is latest-wins, a wheel run sums until it reverses (the same
`shell::continues` predicate the live drain uses), and keys, buttons and the
pick conclusion are owed in full. `HOLD_BACK_CAPACITY` (64/window) is a
security bound, not a scalable capacity: overflow sheds the oldest *input*
event, which is total because folding leaves at most six edges and one
conclusion, and safe because a press is shed before its release. Not fixed
by enlarging `EVENT_MAILBOX_CAPACITY`.

`EventSink::deliver` now takes the typed `WindowEvent` rather than its wire
bytes, because only the sink knows whether an event goes out now, and a
held one must fold by kind and encode once when it finally goes.

**Regression cover.** `a_resize_and_a_pick_conclusion_survive_a_full_mailbox`
and `a_later_event_never_overtakes_one_already_owed`
(`userland/gui/session/src/holdback_tests.rs`) both fail before the fix, on
the dropped event and on the reordering respectively; 14 further tests cover
the folding, the bound, the shed order, and the flush outcomes.
`a_conclusion_the_sink_refuses_stays_pending_until_one_is_accepted`
(`lib/window/src/tests.rs`) pins the `pick_pending` protocol the drop
stranded. `waitset_wait_reports_port_room_once_a_drain_frees_a_slot`
(`kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`) covers the authority gate, quiet-while-full,
ready-on-drain, no waiter record left behind, and the two always-ready
cases; `room_tracks_the_capacity_send_refuses_on` and
`room_waiters_are_recorded_once_and_forgotten_on_request`
(`kernel/ipc/src/port.rs`) cover the port itself.

## D36 — the shared stroke path never converged, so a graph reading wedged its own process — DONE

**Symptom.** The Switchboard monitor stopped updating, one core went to
100%, and the desktop's own hang detector flagged it as not responding. It
never recovered. Distinct from D33/D34: the *desktop* stayed healthy
throughout and the verdict was correct — the monitor really had stopped.
Not input-related, and no interaction is needed to reach it.

**Root cause.** `Surface::stroke_polyline` (`lib/raster/src/surface.rs`)
scaled each segment's perpendicular by the segment's length, and that
length came from a private Newton iteration that terminated on
`while x != prev`. For every `n = m² − 1` the iteration reaches a two-value
cycle (`m`, `m − 1`) and the successive estimates never agree, so the loop
runs forever — 315 such values below 100 000, and a squared segment length
lands on one for a whole family of ordinary slopes (a (2, 2) step is
already `8 = 3² − 1`). The loop issues no syscall, so the task is a lone
runnable CPU burner: nothing to park on, nothing to drain, no wake to miss.

The monitor draws a live `Chart` per resource on its Tasks, System and
Background sections. Its trace steps by whatever the last two readings
differ by, so every 2 s sample is a fresh chance to hit a bad length — the
observed "it just stops eventually, sometimes without touching it". The
same primitive draws window-furniture diagonals, so any window with a close
button was exposed at the sizes whose glyph geometry lands on one.

The justification comment for the hand-rolled helper ("the workspace
minimum Rust version predates `i32::isqrt`") had gone stale: the pinned
toolchain is 1.96.

**Fix.** The helper is deleted. The length is `u64::isqrt` over a widened
sum of squares — bounded by construction, and correct where the old `i32`
accumulation saturated (a segment longer than about 46 340 sub-units
measured short, so its perpendicular came out proportionally too large and
a hairline painted as a band tens of pixels wide). The divisor is a
`NonZeroU64`, so the zero-length case is discharged once at the top rather
than guarded inside the offset arithmetic.

**Regression cover.** In `lib/raster/src/tests.rs`:

- `a_stroke_of_any_slope_draws_and_terminates` — strokes every step in
  ±24 × ±24 and asserts a whole-pixel step always leaves a mark. Hangs
  before the fix (first bad step is (−18, −6), `18² + 6² = 19² − 1`).
- `a_stroke_longer_than_the_surface_keeps_its_weight` — a 4-million-unit
  diagonal must not reach the far corners. Fails before the fix.
- `a_stroke_needs_two_points_and_a_positive_weight`.

In `lib/controls/src/chart_tests.rs`,
`every_reading_plots_at_every_width` reproduces the field failure through
the instrument that hit it: every reading 0–1000 at every box width 9–20.
It hangs before the fix and takes 0.57 s after.

**Related.** This is exactly the task shape D32's forced-yield fix exists
to break — a lone runnable task that never returns to the dispatch loop —
and it confirms that a userland spin is reachable in practice. It is not
D32 itself: the desktop and the other cores stayed live here, because a
user-mode spinner is preemptible and only the wedged process is lost.

## D37 — riscv64 saved no floating-point state, and FP was enabled — DONE

**Cause.** `riscv64gc` is a hard-float ABI and OpenSBI hands S-mode
`sstatus.FS = Dirty`, so floating point ran freely, while the port carried no
`fsd`/`fld`/`fcsr` access and no `FS` handling anywhere. The register file was
therefore shared state: two tasks corrupted — and *read* — each other's
`f0`–`f31`/`fcsr`. Measured at `kernel_main` over the gdbstub before the fix:
`sstatus = 0x8000000200006000` (FS = 3) with `misa` carrying both `F` and `D`.
It was latent only because no FP instruction existed in the riscv64 kernel or
in any riscv64 user binary; the compiler needed no permission to emit one.

**Fixed** with per-task state the task's own trap anchor carries
(`kernel/arch/riscv64/src/fpstate.rs`), lazily, so a task that never computes
in floating point still pays nothing:

- A task starts FP-**off** owning no state, so it cannot read the file and has
  nothing to save or restore. Its first floating-point instruction traps; the
  handler confirms the encoding really reaches the FP unit (an opcode test the
  port keeps itself, reading the instruction through the guarded-copy window so
  an unreadable page fails closed), zeroes the file, gives the task `Initial`,
  and retries. A task that already owns state is refused, so a genuinely illegal
  encoding cannot retry forever.
- A trap saves the file only on a `Dirty` reading, and the return path reloads
  it — eagerly, because lazy *restore* is the disclosure pattern this defect
  already was.
- The kernel may compute in floating point itself, under round-to-nearest.
  The vector enables `FS` before calling the Rust handler, whose prologue may
  already save a floating-point register; a trap from U-mode leaves the saved
  file `Clean`, resetting the rounding mode only when the task changed it; a
  trap that interrupts dirty kernel code keeps its file across the handler;
  the context switch saves `fs0`–`fs11`; and only the epilogue, installing the
  frame's `sstatus`, turns `FS` off just before `sret`. Arming the trap vector
  gives each hart the kernel's `fcsr` rather than the firmware's.
- The area rides the trap anchor at the top of the task's kernel stack, so it
  needs no allocation and no per-CPU publication: switching stacks switches FP
  state. `TRAP_ANCHOR_BYTES` is pinned against `trap.s` by the existing layout
  test, so the assembly and the Rust view cannot drift.

**Regression cover.** `tests/integration/fp_isolation_qemu_riscv64` runs two
U-mode tasks that fill the whole register file with different patterns and
timeshare one hart; its fixture (`tests/integration/fp_probe_program`) holds the
load, the trap, and the read-back in **one** asm block, because half the FP
registers are caller-saved and a Rust call between them would let the compiler
treat the values as dead. It is the only riscv64 user binary in the tree that
emits floating-point instructions, which is what makes the defect observable at
all. Verified to fail before the fix and pass after: neutering just the reload
reports finisher 12 (`FAIL_FP_CLOBBERED`), and the property is asserted ahead of
the yield count so a clobbered file names the cause rather than the short count
it also produces. The `FS` accessors, the two trap decisions, and the first-use
opcode test are host-tested beside them.

**A dependency deliberately not taken.** The opcode test first lived in
`lib/disasm`, which already dispatches on those groups. That was wrong: the
crate renders instructions as text and so pulls in `alloc`, which forced a
global allocator on every consumer of the arch crate and broke six minimal
riscv64 test kernels that rightly have none. Ten lines of opcode test in the
port is the cheaper side of that trade.

The kernel's own floating point is covered by the same vertical: a kernel
computation under a task's non-default rounding mode must round to nearest,
and kernel values must survive an S-mode interrupt and a kernel switch. The
vector registers are D364.

## D38 — the nightly soak killed every filesystem soak, and a memtest sweep mid-progress — DONE

Two independent wall-clock defects in the soak tooling, both found in the
same seven-hour nightly run (`soak.yml`, run 31344475389); both fixed.

**1. A soak child was given an ordinary step's deadline.** All four
`fssoak` jobs died at 46 minutes with
`fssoak <fs> (25200 s) exceeded its 2700s timeout and was killed`, having
written a full `test result: ok` line seconds earlier — the soak was
*working*, and the orchestrator killed it for taking the time it was told
to take. `fssoak::run` handed each `cargo test` child `Context::run`,
whose budget is the 45-minute ordinary-step allowance, while exporting a
seven-hour budget to that same child: any budget above 45 minutes was
therefore unreachable by construction, so the nightly could never have
passed. The fuzz and proptest orchestrators already had the right rule in
`parallel::Job::with_soak_budget`, which is why only `fssoak` failed.
Fixed by lifting that rule into one shared `soak_deadline(budget)`
(`tools/xtask/src/main.rs`) — the budget plus an ordinary step's
allowance, saturating — and routing both `with_soak_budget` and
`fssoak::run` through it, so a fourth orchestrator cannot reintroduce the
divergence. The budget/device-size environment names now come from
`tairix-fuzzseed` too, where the fuzz/proptest names already live, so the
side that exports and the side that reads cannot drift.

**2. A soak loop overran its budget by a whole pass.** The harness
checked the deadline only *after* an iteration, so it always started one
more pass than fitted — on a 1 GiB volume that is 28 s (arxfs) of
overrun, and it is the orchestrator's kill deadline, not the budget, that
ends such a run. The loop now starts another pass only while a pass of
the last one's length still fits, and the two near-identical per-target
loops (`run`/`run_random`) collapsed into one that takes the exerciser as
a function pointer, since the budget arithmetic is what must not diverge.

**3. A progressing memtest sweep was killed by a ceiling that described
no part of it.** `supervisor-memtest-takeover-qemu-{aarch64,riscv64}`
both failed at 120.03 s while their guests were sweeping normally (49% of
RAM, zero errors), which failed the whole `test` soak job. `Spec`'s
absolute ceiling is derived as twice the inactivity budget (D31), a
derivation that assumes total runtime is a small multiple of one phase.
These verticals break that premise: their success *is* one full sweep of
guest RAM, so their runtime scales with the work and with host
contention. Measured: 40 s for boot, sweep, and reset on an idle host;
~4 minutes for the same sweep under the nightly's ~95 concurrent jobs —
so the 120 s ceiling was load-dependent by construction, exactly the
§7 flaky timeout, and would have kept failing every night. A run may now
declare its own ceiling (`Spec::with_runtime_ceiling`, floored at the
silence budget so the two faults stay distinguishable) and the three
takeover verticals declare 15 minutes, over three times the loaded
measurement. The derived default is unchanged for every other vertical,
and the silence budget stays 60 s, so a genuinely hung guest is still
caught as fast as before.

**Not what closed D14.** That `sysmon-qemu-aarch64` timeout was the same
*class* but a different bound: its 120 s is an **inactivity** budget, so it
was a work-heavy guest starved into real silence, not a progressing guest cut
off by a ceiling. Nothing here addressed it; the weighted QEMU concurrency
budget did.

**Regression cover.** `soak_deadline` outlasts every budget it is given
and saturates instead of overflowing; every `fssoak` mode's deadline
outlasts its budget, with the ordinary-step budget asserted too short to
stand in for it; the pass-boundary predicate refuses a pass that would
not finish, admits one that would, and runs exactly one pass without a
deadline; a declared ceiling replaces the derived one while leaving the
silence budget untouched, and is floored at that budget; every takeover
vertical's declared ceiling outlasts its derived one. End-to-end:
`cargo xtask fssoak --target fat32 --secs 25` now runs its child under a
2725 s deadline (was 2700 s) and stops at 20.11 s, inside its budget; the
three takeover verticals pass in 34.4 s (aarch64), 37.2 s (riscv64), and
19.0 s (x86_64) against their 15-minute ceiling.

## D39 — a riscv64 guest stalled dead moments after a `spawn` — DONE

**Root cause: `userentry::enter_user_mode` armed `sscratch` with S-mode
interrupts still enabled.** The riscv64 trap vector's *only* discriminator
between a trap from U-mode and one from S-mode is the entry swap
`csrrw sp, sscratch, sp`: `sscratch` holds the running task's trap anchor
while U-mode runs and **0** while S-mode runs, and a non-zero swap-in
result therefore *means* "from U-mode". The entry sequence armed `sscratch`
two instructions before its `sret` but only cleared `SPP`/`SPIE`, never
`sstatus.SIE` — and the dispatch loop runs in-kernel bodies with S-mode
interrupts enabled, so the window was open on **every** `enter_user`.

A supervisor timer or external interrupt landing in that window was
misclassified as a U-mode trap. It built its frame at the freshly armed
stack top (above the live `sp`, clobbering the caller's own frame), then
returned down the *S-mode* epilogue, which does not re-arm — leaving
`sscratch` **0**. The new process was then `sret`-ed into U-mode with no
kernel stack armed, so its very next trap took the `bnez` fall-through and
built the kernel's trap frame **on the task's own user stack**, corrupting
the running program until it jumped into its data. That final wild jump
raised a U-mode *instruction* page fault, which the trap path answered with
`halt_current_hart()` — total guest silence, on a single-hart guest, moments
after a `spawn`.

That explains every observed property: it only ever appeared just after a
`spawn` (the only caller of `enter_user`), it was timing-dependent on a
~2-instruction window (hence rare, and sensitive to host load skewing
interrupt arrival against the guest instruction stream), and it silenced the
*whole* guest rather than one task.

**Fix (`kernel/arch/riscv64/src/userentry.rs`).** `SIE` joins `SPP`/`SPIE` in
the mask the entry `csrc` clears, ahead of the `csrw sscratch`, so no S-mode
interrupt can be taken while `sscratch` is armed. The mask never reaches the
task: `sret` restores U-mode's interrupt state from `SPIE`, and U-mode stays
preemptible because the hart runs below S-mode. This is what the aarch64
sibling's opening `msr DAIFSet, #0xf` has always done, and what `trap.s`'s
own stated invariant already assumed. Interrupts remain deliberately enabled
inside a syscall body (so a long `ecall` cannot monopolise the hart), which
is safe precisely because `sscratch` is 0 there.

**Fix (`kernel/arch/riscv64/src/{trap,fault}.rs`, that port's
`dispatch.rs`/`boot.rs`).** The reason the corruption ended in *silence* was
a second defect: riscv64 offered only U-mode **load/store** page faults to
the user-fault resolver and sent everything else — an instruction page fault,
an illegal instruction, a misaligned access — straight to
`halt_current_hart()`. Any user program with a wild jump could therefore park
the machine, an unprivileged denial of service. The port now has the
`UserFaultTerminateFn` slot aarch64 already had, and `trap::fatal_exception`
charges an unresumable exception to whoever caused it: from U-mode it kills
that task through the shared arch-neutral
`dispatch_core::terminate_user_fault_via_slot` and the hart carries on; from
S-mode (or when no task can be attributed) it takes the fault handler and
otherwise parks. With no terminator installed the old fatal path is still
what happens, so the install can only fail closed.

**Regression cover.** Host tests in `userentry.rs` pin the entry masks —
`SIE` cleared before the arm, `SPP`/`SPIE` cleared, `SUM` set, and the two
masks disjoint — and fail on the pre-fix constants; two compile-time
assertions pin the same invariants in every configuration. `fault.rs` pins
the terminator slot's set-once round-trip. End to end: **822 consecutive
boots** of `autoload-input-qemu-riscv64` reached the login prompt with no
stall (342 at six-way host concurrency, then 480 at eight-way), where the
same loop on the pre-fix binary silenced a guest at boot **117**.

**Reproducer worth keeping.** Booting `autoload-input-qemu-riscv64` to its
login prompt takes ~2–6 s per guest and drives several `enter_user`
transitions, so six-to-eight concurrent guests in a loop hit the window
roughly once per ~120 boots — a far cheaper probe for this class than the
network verticals the defect was first seen on. Watch for a guest that stops
emitting rather than one that exits: the stall is total silence, and the
guest process stays alive.

**Landed with the original entry (observability only).** The harness reported
"TIMEOUT after 240s **with no serial output**" for a guest that had emitted
12.8 KB — the same misdiagnosis D22 corrected for the sibling outcome, and it
cost time before the transcript was read. Both emitters
(`tools/qemu/src/bin/run.rs`, `tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs`) now
say the guest fell silent for its whole *inactivity* budget and point at the
transcript's last line as the stall point.

## D42 — an x86_64 ring-3 wild jump halted the CPU instead of the task — FIXED

**Root cause: the resolver's gate was data-only, and the fatal tail had
nowhere else to go.** The dedicated `#PF` entry offered a ring-3 fault to
the `UserFaultResolveFn` only when `fault::is_user_data_fault(error_code)`
held — `is_user(code) && code & PF_ERR_INSTR == 0`, i.e. **data** accesses.
A ring-3 *instruction-fetch* fault (a wild jump) therefore reached no
resolver and took the fatal path, parking the CPU for one task's mistake.
The gate itself was right — an instruction fetch is never file backing, so
it is not *resolvable* — but "not resolvable" is not "not attributable",
and the port had no terminator to attribute it to. Reachable from any
unprivileged program, and only on the production configuration:
`IA32_EFER.NXE` is what makes the CPU set the error code's I/D bit
(Intel SDM Vol 3A §4.7), so with NXE off the same fault read as data and
was killed correctly all along.

**Fix.** The ring-3 arm of `tairix_arch_x86_64_page_fault_dispatch` now
splits by *who owns the fault*, not by whether it can be resolved: a data
access goes to the resolver and its verdict is final, and every other
ring-3 `#PF` — an instruction fetch, or a data fault with no resolver
installed — goes to the new `fault::UserFaultTerminateFn`, which kills the
task and never returns for it. The kernel's fatal report is reached only
when neither callback could attribute the fault to a running task, so a
missing install still fails closed. D86 is the same slot's other consumer;
one change closed both. Detail of the slot and its wiring is under D86.

Deliberately *not* offered to the terminator: a `#PF` the resolver already
consulted and refused. A `false` from `resolve_user_fault_via_slot` means
the fault was unattributable (or the reclaimed task had no kthread to
suspend), so a second offer would re-record a crash exit for a task the
resolver had already reclaimed. The sibling ports do double-offer here;
that path ends in a machine halt either way, so the difference is a tidier
record, not a behaviour change.

**Regression cover.** `tests/integration/wild_fault_qemu_x86_64`'s `jump`
role calls a function pointer built from the address of one of its own
`static`s: the image builder maps data pages No-Execute, so the call is a
ring-3 instruction fetch. Confirmed to fail without the fix, with the
vertical's own fatal observer naming it exactly — `vector=14 from_user=true
error_code=21` (`PRESENT|USER|INSTR`), `faulting_addr == rip`. Host-side,
`fault::tests::an_instruction_fetch_is_a_user_fault_the_resolver_never_sees`
pins the classifier relationship the split rests on.

## D43 — a riscv64 U-mode task could steer the kernel onto another hart's per-CPU state — DONE

**Root cause: the trap vector never re-established the kernel's `tp`.** On
riscv64 `tp` (x4) is an ordinary *unprivileged* register — the RISC-V psABI
thread pointer, which U-mode code may write with a single `mv` — and it is
also this port's per-hart kernel anchor: `SchedulerArch::current_cpu`
resolves the running CPU through `smp::current_hartid`, which reads `tp`, and
the Arch-HAL per-CPU slice reads and writes the same register. The vector
saved and restored the caller-saved and callee-saved GPR sets and the
return-state CSRs, but not `tp`, so every `ecall` handed the kernel whatever
value the trapping task had left there.

`li tp, <another hart id>; ecall` therefore made the kernel believe it was
running on that hart: `cpu_for_hartid` maps a *valid* sibling id, so the
dispatcher read and wrote another core's `CpuState` — its resume handle, its
dispatch slot, its published live address space. Driving
`reschedule_current` against a foreign core's saved dispatcher context
context-switches through another task's state; that is kernel memory
corruption reachable from any unprivileged program, not merely a wrong
reading. It was latent only because nothing in the tree used `tp` yet.

**Fix.** `sscratch`'s U-mode meaning is now a per-task **trap anchor**
instead of a bare kernel-stack top: a `TRAP_ANCHOR_BYTES` (16-byte)
kernel-only region at the top of the task's kernel-stack window whose first
word carries the kernel `tp` of the hart the task is running on, with the
trap frame built immediately below it. The from-U prologue spills the user's
`tp` straight into the frame's new `user_tp` slot and reloads the kernel's
from the anchor *before any other register is touched*; the U-return path
publishes the **current** hart's `tp` into the anchor (so a task resumed on a
different hart re-enters U-mode under that hart's true identity) and then
restores the user's value. `enter_user` carves and publishes the anchor
before it arms `sscratch`, and hands a freshly entered task a **zeroed** `tp`
rather than leaking the kernel's hart id into U-mode.

Because the frame lives on the trapping task's own kernel stack, the same
change makes the thread pointer genuinely **per task**: U-mode keeps a value
of its own across every trap and every context switch, which is the platform
contract thread-local storage rests on. No ABI or C-header impact
(`TrapFrame` is internal to the arch crate); `PerCpu`/`current_hartid` keep
their existing "`tp` holds the hart id" semantics, so no other port or
arch-neutral crate changed.

**Regression cover.** `tests/integration/tp_isolation_qemu_riscv64` is the
adversarial witness: its U-mode fixture
(`tests/integration/tp_probe_program`) writes a hostile sentinel into `tp`
before every `ecall` on a **two-CPU** guest (so the sentinel's low-bit `1`
names a real sibling rather than an unmapped id that would fall back safely),
and the dispatch callback fails the run unless `current_hartid()` is still
the true boot hart; the fixture's own exit code fails the run unless its
value came back intact. Confirmed to fail without the fix. Host-side,
`trap_layout_tests.rs` parses every `.equ` out of `trap.s` and pins it
against the `TrapFrame` field or Rust constant it addresses — removing the
hand-copied offsets that used to sit in `syscall_entry_tests.rs` — and pins
the entry ordering (nothing between the swap and the reload may read `tp`)
and the U-return publish-before-restore ordering. `sret_tests.rs` gained the
matching `enter_user` anchor/`tp`-clearing ordering test.

## D44 — a console reader's re-park used a remembered CPU id, so it suspended another core's task — DONE

**State:** fixed. Presented as `tairix-test-stress-qemu-aarch64` failing under
the concurrent `cargo xtask ci` matrix while passing in isolation: `elsh` was
killed moments after it reaped `sysmon` and reclaimed the console foreground,
with the kernel naming a wild fault the shell had not taken —

```
[  9.488] DEBUG id=5000 syscall dispatched task=9 comm=elsh sc=wait
[  9.488] DEBUG id=5000 syscall dispatched task=9 comm=elsh sc=console_foreground
root@tairix ~%
[  9.552] WARN  id=4034 task killed by unresolvable user fault task=9 name=elsh
                write=false fault_class=wild fault_offset=null_page region_offset=0
[  9.555] INFO  id=10004 session ended task=8 user=root exit_code=139
```

**Root cause.** Resume handles are per-CPU: `reschedule_current` suspended the
task published for the CPU id its *caller* passed. `BlockingConsoleRead::
read_until` read that id **once, before** its poll-and-park loop. A console
reader parks, is woken by the next keystroke, and re-parks — and between two
parks the scheduler may dispatch it on a different core. Every re-park after a
migration therefore named the core the reader had *left*, and suspended
whichever task the dispatcher had since published there: the caller's
continuation was written into that victim's `ThreadControl::task_ctx` and the
caller switched to the victim's dispatcher.

The victim was `elsh`, parked in its own console read. When the scheduler next
dispatched it, `dispatch_step` switched into a save area holding a **foreign**
kernel stack pointer, so the CPU unwound another task's syscall handler and
`eret`ed that task's user registers — under `elsh`'s page-table root. Every TAIRiX
program is a PIE at the same load bias, so the foreign registers addressed real
pages of `elsh`'s space: the wild stack pointer sat ~180 KiB below `elsh`'s own,
the growth resolver dutifully backed 17 pristine pages of `elsh`'s stack for a
fault that was not its, and the next epilogue read zeros and `ret`ed to address
`0`. The load dependence is a migration-frequency effect, nothing more.

**Evidence that pinned it.** The faulting EL0 frame was built on a kernel stack
(`0x44cffa00`) that was not `elsh`'s (`0x44c77a00`), on a CPU whose current-task
slot named `elsh` while `elsh`'s own syscalls had just run on another core; the
wild user stack pointer matched the `stress` workers' stack top (`0x1000872000`,
their `enter_user` value) rather than `elsh`'s (`0x10008a2000`); and a
dispatcher-side assertion caught `elsh`'s saved kernel stack pointer sitting
above its own stack top.

**Fix.** `BlockingConsoleRead::read_until` now reads the live CPU **at each
park**, inside its loop, exactly as every other wait loop in the kernel already
did (`procwait`, `sleeplock`, `blockwait`, `blkclient`, the pipe and stream
waits, `park_current_task` — whose own rustdoc had already named this hazard).
The caller's task id is still read once, because a task's id does not change
across a migration; only the CPU does.

Backstop (§2.17): `dispatch_step` now proves a suspension point belongs to the
task before switching into it — the saved kernel stack pointer must lie on that
task's own stack (`KernelStack::carries`, over the new
`KernelStack::usable_bytes`) — and fails the task closed exactly as a
stack-guard violation does. A future mispairing anywhere on the park path is
then a deterministic refusal, never silent cross-task corruption.

**Regression cover.** `kernel/core::console::tests::
a_parking_read_resolves_the_live_cpu_at_every_park` counts the reader's
`current_cpu` reads (`TestArch` now records them) and requires the park to have
resolved one for itself; it fails on the pre-fix source with `saw 1`.
`kernel/core::kthread::tests::
dispatch_step_refuses_a_suspension_point_on_a_foreign_stack` pokes a foreign
stack pointer into a save area and requires the step to refuse — verified to
fail on the pre-fix source, which switched into it — and
`a_kernel_stack_carries_only_its_own_usable_region` pins the predicate,
including that the guard region is not a legitimate frame. End to end, the
`stress-qemu-aarch64` vertical is the acceptance witness: the reproduction ran
in 1–6 rounds of five concurrent guests before the fix and stayed clean over
155 runs after it.

## D45 — the per-CPU live-space publication accepted a non-`Arc` pointer, so its refcount write landed out of bounds — DONE

**State:** fixed. Presented as `cargo test --workspace` intermittently dying
with `SIGABRT` inside the `tairix-kernel-core` lib-test binary — glibc's
`corrupted size vs. prev_size` from `free`, i.e. genuine heap corruption, not a
failed assertion — which failed the whole-project gate's test phase. Minimised
to two `syscalls::tests` run concurrently (either alone was clean at any thread
count).

**Root cause — a real unsound `unsafe` write, not test isolation.** The
per-CPU live-space slot holds a bare `*const ProcessSpace` so the
context-switch path pays no refcount traffic, and `kthread::
current_process_space` (what `thread_create` reaches) reconstructed an owning
`Arc` from it via `Arc::increment_strong_count` + `Arc::from_raw`. That is only
sound because the production publisher forms the pointer with `Arc::as_ptr`.
The invariant lived in a comment, not the type — so the *second* publisher,
`publish_live_space_for_test`, took a `&'static ProcessSpace` from a leaked
`Box` and published it. The increment then wrote eight bytes **16 bytes before**
the value (the neighbouring glibc chunk's `prev_size`), and the matching
decrement on drop could take a fabricated count to zero and free a pointer
before a live allocation. ASAN named it exactly: `WRITE of size 8 ... 16 bytes
before 56-byte region`, from `current_process_space` → `threads::exit`.

**Fix.** `LiveSpacePtr`'s field is private and its only constructor,
`LiveSpacePtr::borrowed(&Arc<ProcessSpace>)`, borrows from a live `Arc`, so a
publication that is not `Arc`-derived is now unrepresentable; the two `unsafe`
reads are its `reborrow` / `clone_owner` methods, whose remaining obligation is
liveness alone (the publication protocol's own property). The test publisher
takes an `Arc` **by value** and holds it in the publish guard, standing in for
the running thread's control-block clone, so the test path has production's
shape rather than a second one.

**A second defect found on the way (§2.18):** `dispatch_step`'s D44
foreign-stack refusal ran *after* `publish_resume` + `publish_live_space` and
returned `Exit` without clearing either. The scheduler then reaps the task and
drops its `ThreadControl` — and the `Arc<ProcessSpace>` clone with it — leaving
the CPU naming a freed control block: the next `reschedule_current` there would
switch into a reaped context, and a kernel kthread's dispatch never clears the
live-space slot, so a stale publication survives its whole run. The refusal now
runs before the switch-in hook and both publications, so a refused task leaves
the CPU naming nothing and never activates its user root either.

**A third, in the futex (§2.18):** `bucket_of` resolved a key by index into
whichever bucket table was live, and `init_buckets` could install the sized
table *after* keys had resolved against the single-bucket fallback — stranding
a registered waiter in a bucket no waker or deadline sweep looks in, which is a
lost wakeup that never resolves. The table is now published exactly once (an
empty `Vec` is the "never sized" answer, so latching it costs no allocation and
cannot fail) and a later sizing is refused; `init_buckets` also uses
`try_reserve_exact`, so a boot-time OOM degrades to the single bucket instead of
aborting. The `bucket_index` hash is factored out as a pure function, so the
spread properties are host-tested without any test installing a table.

**Regression cover.** `procspace::tests::
the_published_handle_is_what_a_reconstruction_shares` pins the strong count
moving on the *published* allocation across a reconstruction and back;
`kthread::tests::a_refused_dispatch_step_publishes_nothing_for_the_cpu` requires
a refused step to run no switch-in hook and leave neither publication (all three
of its assertions fail on the pre-fix source);
`futex::tests::a_resolved_table_is_never_swapped_out_from_under_a_live_key` plus
the two spread tests and `a_bucket_index_is_always_in_range` pin the table. End
to end the minimised pair is the witness: ~1/20 aborts before the fix and 3/3
ASAN heap-buffer-overflow reports, then 60/60 clean, the whole binary 100/100 at
the harness's default thread count, and 5/5 clean under ASAN.

## D46 — no discard reaches the hardware through a layer (partition half DONE, RAID and transport halves OPEN)

**State:** D21's defect class — a defaulted `Block` method answered by a
layer that was never told — for `discard`/`discard_capability` rather than
`device_class`. The partition half is closed; two halves remain, and neither
is a forwarding omission, which is why they are staged rather than swept in.

**The partition half — closed.** `PartitionBlock` translated and forwarded
every other operation but left both discard methods defaulted, so
`discard_capability()` answered "unsupported" for every filesystem mounted
on a partition — which is every real installation (MBR/GPT →
`PartitionBlock` → ARXFS). ARXFS's whole discard engine
(`drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/discard.rs`) was therefore unreachable on
real hardware while testing clean against a raw device. It now forwards
through the same containment check a write gets (`inner_span`, one
definition, so a window can never name a neighbour's blocks), and reports
the device's granularity **only** when the window's start block is aligned
to it — a misaligned window withdraws support rather than promising an
alignment it cannot honour.

**The RAID half — open, and a semantics question.** `RaidArray` dispatches
both methods to the six level kinds, and *none* of them implements either,
so the dispatch can only ever reach the trait default: every array reports
no discard support. This is not a forward to add. Discard on a redundant
array invalidates the redundancy that covers the discarded range — a parity
strip computed over blocks the device may now return as anything — so each
level owes a decision: recompute parity over the discarded range, refuse the
range, or narrow it to whole stripes. Mirror and stripe are near-forwards;
parity, dual-parity, triple-parity, and RAID10 are not.

**The transport half — open, and an ABI change.** `BlkOp` has only
`Geometry`/`Read`/`Write`/`Flush`, so `RemoteBlock` and `BlkClient` cannot
express discard at all and their `Unsupported` is honest. Reaching a
user-space block driver's device needs a new opcode plus its server half in
`blkio::serve` and every block driver. The same wire gap drops
[`BufferClass`] on the `*_with_class` pair, so a sensitive buffer's
scrub-the-staging-copy request does not cross the seam — worth settling in
the same change as the opcode, since both are the same missing field.

**Done when:** each RAID level states and implements its discard posture
with a test per level over a member that records the ranges it is asked to
discard; the wire carries a discard opcode and the buffer class, with
`RemoteBlock`/`BlkClient` forwarding both; and no layer answers either
discard method from a trait default.

## D47 — every desktop launch lost its first argument, so the autostarted file manager ran as an ordinary window (DONE)

`tairix-test-appbar-qemu-aarch64` ran to its 600s ceiling. One defect in
the desktop and one in the harness, both closed.

**The desktop — the argument vector had no argv[0].** `spawn_app` passed
the caller's arguments as the *whole* argv, but a program's own arguments
begin after index 0 (the program name its spawner chose), so every desktop
launch silently lost its leading argument. The file manager's autostart
therefore never saw `--desktop` and took `Role::Window` instead of
`Role::Desktop`: a home-folder window nobody asked for at every login, the
ordinary Info/*Quit* slot convention on a core component the user must not
be able to quit, and a process that ends when that window closes. The same
loss dropped the folder a desktop icon opens and the document an icon
launch names.

The rule is now one host-testable function, `launch_argv` in
`userland/gui/session/src/launch.rs` — the program first, then the
caller's arguments — and `spawn_app` is the only launch path, so every
launch site is correct by construction. The freestanding `Run` loop cannot
be host-tested, which is why the rule lives beside the launch table rather
than in it. Every other spawner in the tree (`files`, `terminal`,
`stress`, `elsh`, `lib/sandbox`) already named its program.

**The harness — it measured the wrong slot.** The click script and both
pixel assertions were written when the strip's leading slot belonged to
the launched application. The autostarted file manager holds slot 0 for
the life of the session, so reading slot 0 for "the launched application"
compared the file manager against itself in the bare frame and could never
witness anything. The script now seats it ahead of the launched
application and drives `APPBAR_LAUNCHED_SLOT`; `assert_app_slot_drawn`
reads that slot and `assert_no_slot_beyond_the_launched_app` reads
`APPBAR_EMPTY_SLOT` beyond it.

The terminal's ~0.5s exit without a window was downstream of the
mis-launch and does not recur: with the component autostart correct the
launched terminal serves its launch window, its *New window* row, and its
slot's default action — the three creates the PASS needs — in 5/5
consecutive runs at ~20s each.

**Regression cover.** `tairix_desktop_session::launch::tests::
a_launch_names_the_program_before_its_arguments` fails on the pre-fix
shape; the vertical itself covers the wiring end to end.

## D48 — a window `Create` an app could build but the session had to refuse (DONE)

The symptom: choosing *Set Date & Time…* from the desktop clock's menu showed
the credential prompt, accepted the credentials, and then no window appeared.

**Cause.** `WindowRequest::Create` carried a `resizable` flag *beside* a
minimum client size, and its decoder refused `resizable = false` with a
non-zero minimum — a window that is never resized has nothing to measure a
floor against. `datetime.app` asked for exactly that: fixed size, minimum set
to its own extent. Every launch of it therefore ended at the window create,
having drawn nothing. A caller could build a request the server was obliged to
reject, which is a defect in the type, not in either party.

**Fix.** `WindowSizing` is a sum type — `Fixed`, or `Resizable` carrying the
floor and the ceiling of the range it may be resized within — carried whole in
`Create`. The contradictory pair has no
spelling, so no app can construct it: `lib/abi`'s
`every_sizing_an_app_can_ask_for_survives_the_round_trip` enumerates every
sizing that exists and asserts each decodes back to itself. The wire decoder
still refuses the pair, because a foreign encoder can still put those bytes on
the wire. Each app now states one sizing: `datetime.app` `Fixed`; `lib/browse`
and Switchboard publish a `WIN_SIZING` their harness reads back; the terminal,
whose floor is a runtime font measurement, declares `win_sizing` and derives
`WIN_RESIZABLE` from it.

**Second half — the silence.** The app *did* state its reason on `stderr`, but
an elevated child inherits login's console, which under a graphical session is
the framebuffer text console behind the desktop: no consumer, no serial, no
user. Login, the only observer of that exit, now audits an abnormal one
(`LAUNCH_ENDED_ABNORMALLY`, `EventId(10_026)`) with the pid, the status, and
the reason `tairix_abi::load_failure_reason` gives a reserved load status. A
clean exit records nothing.

**A misreading to not repeat.** The first diagnosis called this an elevation
running under the wrong account, from `task capabilities derived … uid=1000
caps=3`. Both fields were misread: `caps` is the *count* of derived
capabilities (`kernel/sec/src/captable.rs`), so `caps=3` is all three the
manifest requested, `CAP_TIME_SET` included; and uid 1000 *is* the seeded debug
`root` account (`tools/mkimage/src/rootfs.rs`), i.e. the account the prompt
authenticated. There was never a capability or account defect here.

**Regression cover.** `tairix-test-datetime-elevate-qemu-aarch64` drives clock
→ *Set Date & Time…* → prompt → typed credentials and passes only on two
latches: an `APP_LOADED` naming the bundle, and a window create served on the
reserved endpoint *after* it. It ran to the 600 s ceiling before the fix and
now passes in ~20 s, five consecutive runs.

## D49 — on aarch64 and riscv64 a QEMU vertical's success status is also what a reset produces (OPEN)

Found while closing `plans/NETWORK.md` N16b, whose predecessor suspected the
runner was scoring short runs as passes. It was not — that vertical's runs are
genuine (see N16b) — but the audit it prompted found a real fail-open one level
down, in the harness's verdict itself.

**The defect.** `tairix_qemu::Arch::outcome_from_status` scores a run `Pass` on
the guest's success exit status alone. On x86_64 that status is
`(SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE << 1) | 1` = 33, a value only an `isa-debug-exit` write can
produce, so the status *is* evidence. On aarch64 (semihosting `SYS_EXIT`) and
riscv64 (`SiFive` Test `FINISHER_PASS`) the success status is plain `0` — and
so is the status QEMU exits with when the *machine* goes away under
`-no-reboot`: a guest reset, a PSCI `SYSTEM_OFF`, an SBI SRST shutdown, or a
monitor `quit`. A guest that never reached its assertions but took the machine
down scores exactly like one that passed, on two of the three Tier-1 arches.

Measured on QEMU 11.0.2, not inferred:

```text
$ printf 'system_reset\n' | qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -display none \
      -no-reboot -monitor stdio -serial null; echo $?
0
```

The tree already knows this hazard: `outcome_from_done`'s `reset_success_marker`
arm exists precisely because "a crash that merely triple-faults into a reset
(also status `0`) still fails loud (it never reached the marker)". That defence
is opt-in, and only the three `memtest`-takeover verticals opt in. Every other
aarch64/riscv64 enrolment falls through to the bare status decode.

A second, narrower instance of the same shape: the host process status is 8
bits, so `qemu_exit::exit_failure(code)` with `code % 256 == 0` also lands on
`0` and scores `Pass`. No enrolment uses such a code today (the failure
constants run 1–19, plus `FAIL_EXIT_BASE = 100` and a small guest code), so
this half is latent, not live.

**Why it is latent rather than live today.** No enrolled vertical resets or
powers off its guest: the panic bridges park the CPU, an unhandled exception
reaches a panic, and no serial script types `reboot`/`shutdown`.
`KernelArch::reboot`/`poweroff` are reachable from userland, so the reachability
is one enrolment away; and the riscv64 path is the closest to live, because an
unhandled M-mode trap can end in a firmware reset rather than a park.

**Why the obvious host-side fixes do not work.** `-no-shutdown` keeps QEMU
alive across a guest reset, which would make the reset fail loud — but on
riscv64 it also blocks the success path, because QEMU 11 routes
`FINISHER_PASS` through the same shutdown machinery a reset uses (measured:
`tairix-test-kernel-arch-boot-riscv64` exits 0 in 0.11 s without it and has to
be killed with it). `-action shutdown=` accepts only `poweroff`/`pause`, so
there is no "exit with a distinguishable status" action either. The
distinguishing evidence has to come from the guest.

**The two candidate designs, and their costs.** Both make success provable
rather than inferred; neither is a per-vertical opt-in.

1. *A reserved success status.* `exit_success` reports a magic non-zero status
   on all three arches (aarch64: the `SYS_EXIT` subcode; riscv64: the
   `SiFive` coded-status word), so one shared decoder replaces the three
   per-arch ones and a reset can never produce it. Atomic by construction —
   one semihosting call or one MMIO store, nothing to interleave. The cost is
   that the reserved value then may never be a failure code, which the
   open-ended `FAIL_EXIT_BASE + code` space does not enforce; and it reads
   oddly on riscv64, where the device names that word "fail".
2. *A finisher witness on the console.* `exit_success` prints a fixed marker
   before terminating and the host requires it for a success status — the
   `reset_success_marker` mechanism, made universal instead of opt-in. No
   reserved value, one rule for every arch. The cost is that the marker must
   reach the transcript un-interleaved on an SMP guest, so it needs the
   console gate's whole-line framing plus a flush rather than the direct
   `beacon` path.

**Done when:** a success verdict on every Tier-1 arch rests on evidence a
reset cannot forge; the three `reset_success_marker` verticals keep working
(their success *is* a reset); a host unit test pins that a status-`0` exit
without the guest's evidence is `Fail` on aarch64 and riscv64; and the whole
`test --qemu` matrix is green on all three arches afterwards, since the change
alters the pass criterion for every enrolment and a vertical that was passing
on a machine-death status would surface here.

## D50 — the flake hunt's concurrent replicas re-planted one guest's disk underneath itself (DONE)

Found while making `test --qemu` persist a transcript for every run
(`plans/NETWORK.md` N16b), which added a second per-run output to a path set
that was already colliding.

**The defect.** `ci_long::flake_hunt` runs each unit `REPS` times
*concurrently*, so up to `budget / weight` runs of one enrolment are in flight
at once (four on a 24-CPU host; one on a small runner, where the weight
saturates the budget and the batch serialises — which is why this never
surfaced in CI). Each run re-plants its guest's backing image inside `run_one`,
and the path was a pure function of the *binary*, so a replica's
`plant_raw_disk` truncated and rewrote a 200 MiB image that a sibling replica's
QEMU had open — corrupting a live guest's disk mid-run. The failure it produces
is an arbitrary guest misbehaviour with no local cause, i.e. exactly what a
flake hunt is supposed to distinguish *from* a real flake.

The flake hunt already threaded a repetition index into its job factory; the
QEMU unit was the one factory that discarded it (`move |_|`).

**Fix.** The sidecar path is a function of the run, not the binary:
`sidecar_path(kernel, t, replica, ext)` separates both colliding axes — the
`TESTS` index for enrolments that share one built binary, and the replica index
for concurrent runs of one enrolment. Replica zero of a singly-enrolled binary
keeps the plain `<binary>.<ext>` name, so the pull-request matrix's paths are
unchanged. `Enrolment::run` takes the replica; `ci_long`'s QEMU unit passes the
hunt's own index.

**Regression cover.** `sidecar_paths_never_collide_across_enrolments_or_replicas`
enumerates every enrolment × 32 replicas × both sidecar kinds and asserts the
paths are distinct — it fails on the first shared-binary enrolment when the
replica index is dropped. The transcript is covered by the same test because it
is now a per-run output too.

## Non-goals / do not do

- Do NOT re-open the settled FIX-SYSCALL design decisions (no per-syscall
  interruptibility flag §2.3/§2.4; kernel stays non-preemptible §4;
  reuse P-5's single wake/drain discipline §2.2).
- Do NOT collapse D1–D4 into one mega-change — each is a distinct defect
  class with its own gate.
- Do NOT grow the compiled-in surface or ABI beyond what each seam
  already exposes (§2.3/§2.4).
- Do NOT mark any item done on a green compile alone — the tests and the
  §23 gate are the bar.

## D52 — an x86_64 shootdown target that cannot take the IPI could not acknowledge (FIXED)

**The defect.** `tairix_arch_x86_64::tlb_shootdown` reached the other CPUs by
raising an IPI at each and spinning until every one acknowledged *from its
ISR*. That assumed each target could take the interrupt. A CPU whose own
interrupts are masked cannot, and `IrqSafeSpinLock` masks the CPU for the
whole of its acquire **spin** — `tairix_kalloc`'s heap lock included. So one
initiator was enough, not two:

- CPU A holds the heap lock (masked), shrinks a grown region, drives
  `KernelVirtMap::unmap_run` → `shootdown_range` → IPI at B, then spins for
  B's acknowledge;
- CPU B makes any kernel heap allocation, masks its interrupts, and spins for
  the heap lock A holds.

B could not take A's IPI; A never saw B's acknowledge. Both spun for ever.
It was x86_64-only for the same reason the fix is: aarch64 broadcasts in
hardware, and the riscv64 SBI RFENCE is served by firmware in M-mode, which
S-mode masking does not gate.

The cycle was never reachable in the shipped kernel, because the production
x86_64 pipeline is single-CPU by construction — `boot.rs` builds
`cpu_to_lapic` as `[Option<u8>; 1]` holding only the BSP, so the target set is
empty, no IPI is raised and nothing is waited on. The protocol was wrong
regardless of which callers happened to exercise it, and its old contract
gated every subsystem that must reclaim window pages (D82, now fixed).

**The fix: the port owes the acknowledge, not the caller.** Two changes, and
the caller-side precondition the HAL contract used to state is deleted.

- **A target acknowledges from a spin as readily as from its ISR.**
  `serve_pending` is the acknowledge, and it is reached from the shootdown
  ISR, from the descriptor's own acquire spin (the two-masked-initiators
  case), and from **every spin round in `lib/sync`** — `spinwait::spin_wait`,
  which each primitive in that crate now spins through, running the service
  the port installs once (`spinwait::install_service`, from
  `x86_64/boot.rs`). Putting it there rather than in a list of audited locks
  is what makes the property total: it holds for a lock added later and for a
  caller no registry names. aarch64 and riscv64 install nothing and pay one
  load and a branch per round.
- **A published target bitmap, not a generation counter.** The initiator
  stores the range and the acknowledge count, then publishes a 32-byte bitmap
  of target LAPIC ids **last** as the "go" signal. A target claims by
  clearing its own bit, so the prior value `fetch_and` returns is *both* the
  claim and the "am I a target?" test: exactly one caller wins it, and a CPU
  whose bit is clear — a stale delivery, a CPU never asked, the initiator
  itself — invalidates and decrements nothing. That is what stops a target
  acknowledging twice (once from its spin, once when the deferred IPI finally
  lands), which would return the *next* initiator early, i.e.
  under-invalidate.

Invariants the design rests on, each load-bearing:

- `pending >= popcount(targets)` always, because a target clears its bit
  before it decrements. So `pending == 0` proves no bit is set, which is what
  lets `serve_pending` gate on one load rather than a LAPIC MMIO read — and
  it is why the descriptor is provably all-zero when a holder releases it.
- Winning the claim proves the winner is an unacknowledged target, so the
  initiator is still inside `shootdown` holding the descriptor and the range
  read after the claim is still its range.
- The bitmap **excludes the initiator's own id**, so the initiator can never
  be a target of its own request; that is why its acknowledge wait does not
  serve (it would be dead work) and why a caller that lists itself, or lists
  a target twice, cannot inflate the count into a wait that never ends. The
  32 bytes cover the 8-bit xAPIC id space exactly — an architectural width,
  not a CPU-count ceiling, so no id can fall outside it.
- With no target at all the call never touches the descriptor: a local
  `invlpg` sweep and return, which is every production call today.

**Proof.** The bitmap bookkeeping is host-tested (`target_map` /
`for_each_target`: whole-id-space coverage, self-exclusion, duplicate
collapse, and that every asked id is yielded back exactly once).
`cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown_qemu_x86_64` drives all three routes home on two
real cores — the AP's ISR; the AP's *masked* spin for a lock the BSP holds
across its shootdown (the production heap-lock shape); and two masked
initiators shooting at each other, where whichever wins the descriptor cannot
finish until the loser serves it from its own descriptor spin. Each step
blocks until its acknowledge lands. Removing the `lib/sync` install wedges
step two and removing the descriptor-spin serve wedges step three, both at the
60 s timeout, so the two serve points are independently necessary and
independently proven.

**Still owed by x86_64 SMP bring-up (`plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md`), not by this
protocol.** Two properties a future bring-up must supply, recorded here
because getting either wrong reintroduces a silent hang:

- **The target set must be the set of *started* CPUs, never the set the MADT
  lists.** A CPU parked waiting for a SIPI cannot service a fixed-vector IPI,
  so an acknowledge would never come. Today the map holds only the BSP, so
  the case does not arise.
- **Production installs no shootdown ISR.** `init_local_tlb_shootdown` has no
  production caller — only the QEMU vertical — so vector `0x21` still holds
  the fail-closed default thunk on a production boot. Inert while the target
  set is empty; a prerequisite the moment it is not.

## D53 — kernel-heap grow/shrink thrash now costs per-page work (OPEN, reachability unconfirmed)

**Mechanism.** `kalloc` hands a grown region back to its source the instant
the region drains, with no hysteresis. That was free when the source was one
`alloc_order` / `free_order` pair. Since the fragmentation-immune growth
landed (`plans/FIX-KHEAP.md`) a region costs work proportional to its page
count: at the 16-page growth granule an alloc/free cycle that spills out of
the bootstrap region pays 16 page-table installs, 16 teardowns, 16
system-wide invalidations and 16 frame frees — where it previously paid two
frame operations. `lib/kalloc`'s own
`grow_shrink_cycles_are_stable_and_reuse_space` test exercises exactly that
pattern and shows one grow *and* one shrink per allocation over 1000 rounds.

**Why it is recorded rather than fixed.** The regression bites only while the
heap is serving allocations out of *grown* regions — i.e. once the 64 MiB
bootstrap region is exhausted. Nothing observed so far establishes that the
system reaches that state: if it did, every small kernel allocation would
thrash and the whole machine would crawl, not one application. Building a
retention cache for a path that is not known to be hot is the speculative
optimisation the charter forbids, so the cost is stated here with its
arithmetic instead of guessed at.

**The fix, when it is confirmed.** Hysteresis where the cost lives: the
growth source keeps one granule-sized chunk mapped instead of tearing it
down, and hands it back on the next grow that fits. Retention is then bounded
by one growth granule rather than by the largest region ever grown, which is
what makes it acceptable against "an idle system does not hold memory it has
freed"; a larger region amortises its own mapping against the allocation that
needed it and is still returned promptly. Validating a retained run without
releasing its address space needs a non-mutating `SlotWindow` query
(`AnonWindowMap::validate`'s counterpart).

**Confirming it.** Instrument the source's grow/shrink counts over a desktop
session and check whether the heap is serving small allocations from grown
regions at all. Fix only if it is.

## D54 — a desktop worker thread issued ~2500 file opens at session start, starving every concurrent reader (CLOSED)

**What it was.** Between 7.47 s and 12.65 s of the `autoload-input-qemu-aarch64`
desktop boot one thread of the `desktop` process issued some 2500 audited
`fs_open` + `fs_write` pairs — a file open and a worker-wake byte — each open a
full VFS resolution against the one boot disk. Every bundle load inside that
window ran at about 0.5 MB/s; every load outside it ran at the disk's rate.

**Why it is closed.** The shape — a desktop worker that opens a file, wakes the
serve loop, and is handed the same work again — was three loops, all gone:

- the icon desk re-attempting a decode the memory band had refused, every round
  (D57);
- the listing desk leaving an answered request standing, so its worker read the
  same folder for ever (`an_answered_read_is_never_handed_out_again`);
- the session asking for a fresh listing of its `Desktop` folder on every worker
  wake, so each unrelated completion — an icon, a thumbnail — cost a directory
  read and a second wake. `Desktop::relist` now asks only at the moments a
  folder may have changed, and `Desktop::resume` only collects what it is owed
  (`resuming_adopts_the_owed_listing_and_never_starts_a_read`).

**Measured on the same vertical.** The whole run now issues about 315 desktop
`fs_open` + `fs_write` records, and the busiest second is the program catalogue's
one-shot walk — 89 opens, one per catalogued `AppInfo`, ending in a single wake.
The listing worker lists the `Desktop` folder three times in the whole run; in
the Settings vertical's wallpaper pane it lists it twice for twelve thumbnails,
where it had listed it once per thumbnail.

---

## D55 — the x86_64 direct physical map covered only the first gigabyte (DONE)

**The defect.** The x86_64 port had two physical maps and neither was sized
from the machine. `direct_phys_map()` handed out a fixed `[0, 1 GiB)` window
at `KERNEL_VMA_BASE`, and the page-table/frame view was a fixed `[0, 4 GiB)`
identity window; both were build-time constants, where the aarch64 and
riscv64 ports size theirs from discovery. Every kernel path that reaches a
frame by pointer — the spawn image write, the shared-memory zero-on-free
scrub, the remap window's `kvslots` store, the kernel heap's slab page supply
(`plans/FIX-KHEAP.md`) — therefore failed closed for a frame above the
window. It was not latent: the buddy allocator hands out its highest frames
first, so on any machine with RAM above the window the *first* frame drawn was
already unreachable.

**Fix.** One map, sized from the boot memory map: the trampoline's fixed
window became a floor, and once `build_memory_map` has run the boot path
widens the map to the top of usable RAM, carving any page tables it needs
out of the map first so the allocator never hands them out. Every root
constructor and the direct map read the one published extent, so none can
carry a different one, and it fails closed rather than booting on RAM it
cannot address. (D56 then moved that map out of the low half; the sizing,
the carve and the fail-closed shape are unchanged, so the symbol names
above live in that entry.)

The two maps collapsed into one `PhysMap` which `direct_phys_map()`, the
page-table frame source, both spawn seams, and the root-unlock DMA/MMIO
bring-up all share, so the `PHYSMAP_SPAN` / `IDENTITY_GIB` constants each of
them carried are gone. PID 1's page tables moved to the
allocator-backed source the runtime spawn already used: on a part without
1 GiB pages the window costs a directory per gigabyte, which a fixed `.bss`
reserve would have capped.

**Two defects fell out of it.** `ensure_child` dereferenced a present *huge*
leaf as a page table, which 1 GiB identity leaves made reachable; it now
refuses. And the RAM self-test silently skipped what the direct map did not
cover while the console settled on the installed total: it now reports
`verified` and `unreachable` separately (`AuditEvent::RamSelfTest`, `Warn`
when non-zero) and starts each region past frame zero, whose identity
translation is the null pointer and so used to take the whole first chunk of
low RAM untested with it.

**Regression cover.** `tests/integration/physmap_qemu_x86_64` boots the
production pipeline on a 3584 MiB guest — the smallest `-m` for which QEMU's
`pc` machine places any RAM above 4 GiB — and requires both that the map was
sized past the trampoline's own window and that the self-test left no usable
byte unreachable, i.e. every byte above 4 GiB was written and read back
through `direct_phys_map()`. Host tests cover the sizing, the top-down carve
and its reservation, and the engine's zero-page skip and unreachable
accounting.

The bound this left — RAM above the user virtual base, because the map was
an identity window sharing each process root's low half with the child
image — is gone on every port (D56): each map moved out of the user region.

## D56 — the page tables are reachable only through an identity map (CLOSED)

**Mechanism.** Every port's page-table walk *used to* recover a child table
by dereferencing the physical address its parent entry holds
(`phys as *mut [u64; 512]`), which forced the port's direct map to satisfy
`virtual == physical`; and the identity window that satisfied it lived in the
low half of every process root, which it shares with the child image at
`spawn_layout::CHILD_USER_BIAS` (64 GiB), so the window stopped there. Both
halves are now closed on all three ports: a walk recovers each level through
`PageTableFrames::table_at` on the frame source that drew it, so no port
carries a physical/virtual relationship of its own, and each port's map
lives outside its user region.

**Consequence, while it stood.** No corruption — a frame above the window
failed its translate and its consumer failed closed — but a machine with
more than 64 GiB of RAM degraded exactly as it did below 1 GiB before D55.
Three further costs rode on the same root cause, all of them now gone on
every port: a standing Meltdown-class exposure (every process root carried a
full-RAM kernel-only mapping in the half its own code addresses), KPTI
blocked (kernel tables cannot be isolated from a user root while the user
root is *required* to carry that map), and a per-process page-table cost
that scaled with RAM (one page directory per identity gigabyte where the
part lacks 1 GiB pages — about 4 MiB of tables per process on a 1 TB
machine, for a mapping user space must never use).

### x86_64 — closed

A kernel-half direct map at `paging::PHYSMAP_VMA_BASE`
(`0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000`), claiming PML4 slots `256..=509` — the first slot
above the port's user region (`USER_VA_TOP == 1 << 47` *is* slot 256's base)
up to the kernel remap window at 510. 254 slots at 512 GiB is **127 TiB**,
and the ceiling is now the 4-level paging layout rather than where user
space begins. Three properties follow from the placement, and they are the
three costs above:

* **The low half is user-only.** `AddressSpace::new_process_root` carries
  the two kernel windows and the map, and **no identity map at all**:
  nothing a process root must keep reachable is addressed physically,
  because the kernel is linked higher-half and RAM is in the map. The walk
  additionally refuses a user leaf in any kernel-half slot
  (`is_kernel_half_slot`) — the fail-closed floor under the window
  allocators' own bounds.
* **A process pays no pages for the map.** Its tables are drawn once and
  shared; a root's whole share is its own PML4 entries.
* **The identity window stopped growing.** `new_boot_identity` maps exactly
  `BOOT_IDENTITY_GIB`, for the addresses that genuinely need to be
  themselves (the trampoline's tables, the AP start-up trampoline at
  `0x8000`, the firmware tables and the multiboot2/PVH blob). It is never
  widened; `widen_boot_identity` is gone, and with it the first of the two
  residues this entry used to list.

**The floor is the trampoline's, not the boot path's.** `boot.s`
SAFETY-INVARIANT 10 installs `PML4[256] → boot_pdpt_physmap`, whose low four
entries point at the identity window's own page directories — so the map
costs one table and no leaves of its own, and physical `X` is reachable at
`PHYSMAP_VMA_BASE + X` from the first instruction after paging is on. This
is load-bearing rather than an optimisation: the LAPIC register block is
named at one address (`preempt::LAPIC_BASE_VIRT`), the interrupt paths write
EOI under whichever root the interrupted task had loaded, and two
integration fixtures run their own `kernel_main` and would otherwise fault
on their first LAPIC read. `install_boot_physmap` therefore *widens* the
floor over the discovered RAM, and verifies the trampoline's entry against
its own slot constant first, because the asm writes it by byte offset.
`LAPIC_BASE_PHYS` survives only for the MSI/IPI destination encoding, which
is a device-visible message address rather than a dereference; the IO-APIC
blocks and the firmware ECAM window go through the map too.

**The boot stack had to move first.** `.boot.bss` is linked 1:1 in low
memory and `%rsp` was never rebased, so the kernel ran its whole boot on a
stack that existed only in the identity window — the first push after a
switch to a process root would have faulted. `linker.ld` derives
`boot_stack_{bottom,top}_high` from its own `KERNEL_VMA_BASE`, the
trampoline loads the high alias on landing in the higher half, and the panic
backtrace bounds follow. The bytes do not move; only how the kernel
addresses them, which also aligns the boot stack with
`validate_kernel_rsp0`'s canonical-higher-half requirement.

**The map's tables sit outside every frame source, deliberately.** They are
carved from the firmware memory map before an allocator exists, so
`table_at` refuses them and a page-table *walk* of a direct-map address
reports nothing mapped. That is the fail-closed behaviour the walk owes a
table it cannot vouch for, and nothing needs otherwise: the map is reached
by `PhysMap::translate` arithmetic, and root teardown drops its slots before
it descends so the shared tables are never freed.

**Proved by.** `tests/integration/physmap_qemu_x86_64` on a 3584 MiB guest
adds a structural probe to D55's two assertions: a frame reachable through
the map while the user address that would alias it under an identity map
holds an *unrelated* mapping, the two in disjoint root slots, and the
frame's bare physical address resolving to nothing. It witnesses the
hardware translation by reading the frame's marker back through the map
rather than walking into the map's own tables, and a failing check names
itself on the serial. Host tests cover the slot layout, the widening's frame
count, a process root having no identity map where a boot root does, the
kernel-half refusal of a user leaf, and every root installing the published
map. KPTI is no longer blocked by the map; it remains
`Mitigation::Pending` on its own terms (`kernel/arch/x86_64/src/sidechannel.rs`).

### riscv64 — closed

Sv39 is a **39-bit** regime, so the whole address space is 512 GiB and the
room the x86_64 map found does not exist — but the upper half below the
kernel remap window does, and that is exactly where the two sub-defects
below lived. Root slots `256..=446` at `0xFFFF_FFC0_0000_0000`
(`paging::PHYSMAP_VMA_BASE`) are the map: slot 256 *is* where the user region
ends (`USER_VA_TOP == 1 << 38`), slot 447 is where the remap window begins,
and because a root-level Sv39 leaf already **is** a 1 GiB page, 191 slots
give **191 GiB** of reach for no page tables at all. Two riscv64
simplifications over x86_64 fall out of that: there is no
`physmap_table_frames`/carve, and no boot trampoline laying a floor (the boot
root is built in Rust), so the map is installed once from the discovered map
with no floor/widen split.

The three properties the x86_64 half lists hold here too, with one honest
difference:

* **Its extent is bounded by the architecture, not by the child image.** The
  ceiling is the Sv39 layout; RAM above `MAX_PHYSMAP_GIB` is reported by the
  RAM self-test as `unreachable_bytes` and every consumer fails closed.
* **No user address can name it.** The user region *is* the canonical lower
  half, pinned at build time in `riscv64.rs` exactly as x86_64 pins its slot
  256. The walk additionally refuses a user leaf in any kernel slot
  (`is_kernel_slot`), reporting `InvalidFlags` — the floor the port lacked
  entirely, where before a user leaf in a map slot was refused only
  incidentally, by `AlreadyMapped`.
* **A process pays no pages for it.** `install_physmap_slots` copies the
  published gigapage leaves into every root both constructors build, so no
  space exists without the map and none draws a table for it.
* **MMIO stays on the identity window, unlike x86_64.** This kernel is
  identity-linked, so every root it can execute under carries a low identity
  window anyway; the map therefore needs no MMIO floor and
  `direct_map_gib` is called with zero. `identity_gigapages()` is the one
  definition of that 4 GiB window — a bound on where the hardware puts the
  kernel image, stack, leaked state and board MMIO, not a capacity, and no
  longer a bound on how much RAM the kernel can reach. A board whose kernel
  image ends above it is refused at boot
  (`BootError::KernelAboveIdentityWindow`) rather than faulting on the first
  `activate`: that fail-open hole is closed with the map.

The two sub-defects this entry used to list are closed by the same move,
because the slots the false claim occupied are where the map belongs:

* The spawn path's frame view was `DirectPhysMap::identity(4 GiB)`, a worse
  ceiling than the 64 GiB x86_64 carried, and the same view served
  `direct_phys_map()` — so the RAM self-test, the shared-region scrub, the
  kernel slab supply and the root-unlock DMA pool were all capped there. All
  of them now go through one `ConfiguredPhysMap` that re-derives its limit
  from the live map per call, so no caller can hold a stale extent.
* The boot space was built `new_identity_gigapages(&BOOT_PAGE_TABLES, 447)`,
  and Sv39 sign-extends from bit 38 — so slots 256..446 mapped *upper-half*
  virtual addresses to physical 256..446 GiB, identity in neither direction.
  `IDENTITY_GIGAPAGES` is now `PHYSMAP_FIRST_SLOT` (256) and the constructor
  **refuses** a wider extent, so the dishonest mapping is unrepresentable
  rather than merely unused.

**Two consumers the move forced, both of them latent defects it exposed.**
The Supervisor's `memtest` takeover flattened paging to bare mode, on the
reasoning that an identity-mapped kernel keeps every address under it; the
sweep reaches RAM through the direct map, which bare mode resolves to nowhere.
It now installs the reserved boot kernel root (`paging::park_kernel_root`) —
the only root whose tables live wholly in the kernel image, which is the
requirement the sibling ports already satisfy their own way, and it fails
closed with `PrepareFailed` if none is published. And three self-chassis
fixtures (`threads`, `stack_grow`, `file_map`) drove the *production* spawn
producer with the kernel at `satp = 0`, a configuration production never has;
they now bring paging up through the one shared sequence
(`boot_riscv64::enable_paging_and_direct_map`), which is what the producer has
always needed and what production does.

**Proved by.** `tests/integration/physmap_qemu_riscv64` on a 3072 MiB guest
(the `virt` board bases RAM at `0x8000_0000`, so it tops out at 5 GiB and
clears the old 4 GiB window): the observer grades that the map was sized past
that window, that the self-test left `unreachable_bytes == 0`, and a
structural probe of the live root — a known frame read back through the map by
the hardware, the map's slot disjoint from every user address, a user leaf
refused in it, and a high physical address resolving to nothing under a
process root. Host tests cover the slot layout and base, the `physmap_virt`
arithmetic, the `is_kernel_slot` boundaries, the user-leaf refusal at both
entry points, every root carrying the published map, and the set-once
publication rejecting an over-cap extent.

### aarch64 — closed

Also a 39-bit regime, but the answer is not to find room inside one: the
architecture already offers two. `TCR_EL1.T0SZ = 25` keeps `TTBR0_EL1` on
the low `[0, 2^39)` for user space, and `T1SZ = 25` with `EPD1` **clear**
gives `TTBR1_EL1` the top `2^39` bytes (`paging::KERNEL_VA_BASE` =
`0xFFFF_FF80_0000_0000`) to the kernel. `TTBR1_EL1` is programmed in the
same sequence that clears `EPD1` — so a walk of the kernel regime can never
see the register's architecturally UNKNOWN reset value — and nowhere else.

Root slots `0..=446` of that regime are the map at `paging::PHYSMAP_VMA_BASE`
(which *is* `KERNEL_VA_BASE`), and `447..=510` are the kernel remap window,
which moved there from the top of `TTBR0`. An L1 leaf is already a 1 GiB
block, so 447 slots give **447 GiB** of reach for no page tables at all.
The three properties the sibling halves list hold here more strongly,
because the architecture rather than a slot convention enforces the first:

* **No user address can name it — structurally.** The two regimes are
  separate walks with separate roots, so there is no slot a user leaf and a
  kernel leaf could contend for. `USER_VA_TOP <= KERNEL_VA_BASE` is pinned
  at build time in `aarch64.rs`, and the port is now KPTI-ready: a
  `TTBR0`-only unmap of the kernel would be a change to `activate_user_root`
  rather than to the layout.
* **A process pays nothing at all for it.** `TTBR1_EL1` points at one
  global `.bss` root (`paging::KERNEL_L1`) on every CPU for the image's
  lifetime, so a process root carries neither a page nor a *slot* of the
  kernel's — unlike x86_64 and riscv64, which copy the map's leaves into
  every root. The per-root `install_*_slots` calls are gone, and a switch
  between user spaces reprograms `TTBR0_EL1` alone.
* **The identity window stopped growing.** It is derived once, pre-MMU,
  from the Device mask and a new *kernel-extent* mask
  (`configure_kernel_gigapages` over the image, the firmware tree and the
  scan-out surface) — the things the kernel addresses physically. The old
  RAM mask, widened over every discovered `/memory` window, is gone with
  `ensure_identity_gigapage` and `widen_ram_gigapages`; a root's window no
  longer tracks installed RAM.

**The map is sparse, and that is the aarch64-specific part of the design.**
It carries a leaf only for a gigapage the discovered, Device-clipped
`/memory` windows name. A Normal-cacheable alias of a gigapage the board
types Device would be *mismatched memory attributes for one physical
address*, which permits a speculative read of a device register — and here
the page tables are the sole authority on memory type, with no x86 MTRR to
override them. The Pi 4 makes this concrete rather than theoretical: its
below-4 GiB RAM window ends inside the gigapage holding the
UART/GIC/PCIe block, so a contiguous `[0, top)` map over an 8 GiB board
would alias the whole peripheral block Normal. `clip_windows_to_normal_ram`
already keeps those bytes out of the allocator, so a hole in the map and a
hole in the allocator's supply are the same hole; `physmap_covers` is a
per-gigapage check, not an extent comparison, and fails closed on a range
that straddles one. That is also why there is no `direct_map_gib` call
here.

**A regime is a property of a root, not of an address.** The L1 index of a
window address and of a user address 447 GiB up are the same nine bits, so
a kernel mapping walked through a process root would have landed at a
*user* address. `AddressSpace` therefore carries a `Regime` discriminant
and every mapping operation refuses an address the root's regime does not
hold — the fail-closed floor that replaced `is_kernel_window_slot`'s
slot-range refusal. The same check guards `set_accessed_flag_in_active`,
which would otherwise have fixed up an unrelated user leaf for a
kernel-regime fault. `reclaim_table_frames` is regime-aware too: a
kernel-window handle owns nothing reclaimable, so it retires without
walking the shared hierarchy.

**Two consumers the move forced, both of them latent defects it exposed.**
The `memtest` takeover kept the MMU on under `TTBR0`'s identity map, on the
reasoning that an identity-mapped kernel keeps every address under it; the
sweep reaches RAM through the direct map, so it now installs the reserved
boot kernel root first (`paging::park_kernel_root`) and fails closed with
`PrepareFailed` if none is published — the riscv64 answer, and the step goes
first because it is the only one that can refuse. And the residue this
entry used to list is closed: `paging::table_path`, the watchdog's
fault-proof `AT S1E1R` probe of the active root, read each table as though
its physical address were its own virtual one. That was only ever true of
the identity window, which no longer covers the RAM a page table is drawn
from; it now reads through `physmap_virt` and ends the walk on a table the
map does not cover.

**Proved by.** `tests/integration/physmap_qemu_aarch64` on a 3 GiB guest —
the `virt` board bases RAM at `0x4000_0000`, so 3 GiB spans the two
gigapages above the one holding the kernel image, and the vertical's build
script dumps its `virt` tree for that same figure (the boot path sizes the
map from the tree's `/memory` window, so the tree and the `-m` must agree;
`dump_aarch64_virt_dtb_with_ram`). The observer grades that the map was
sized from the tree rather than a constant, that the self-test left
`unreachable_bytes == 0` over all 3 GiB, and a structural probe: a known
frame read back through the map by the hardware, the map's address
unreachable *and* unmappable under a process root, and a RAM frame above
the kernel's own gigapage reachable only through the map. That last check
is the one that fails with the old full-RAM widening restored — verified
both ways before the gate.

Host tests cover the two-regime `TCR_EL1` encoding (both sizes, `EPD1`
clear, the distinct `TG1` encoding, `A1`, both cacheability pairs), the
regime layout and the window's representable extent, the regime refusal at
every mapping entry point in both directions, a window handle reclaiming
nothing, `physmap_virt` arithmetic, and `install_boot_physmap`'s Device
exclusion, per-gigapage coverage, straddle refusal, set-once publication
and ceiling refusal.

### What the seam change closed

The walk itself. `PageTableFrames` gained `table_at(phys) -> Option<*mut
[u64; 512]>` — implemented once per source, never per call site: each
port's `PageTablePool` resolves the address to the slot it was handed out
of (through the shared `frames::pool_slot_of`), and `kernel/mem`'s
`FrameTableSource` re-translates it through the same direct map
`alloc_table` used. `reclaim_hierarchy` now takes the source directly, so
its `entries_of` and free closures are gone from all three ports. Three
things fell out of it:

* **The walk fails closed.** A corrupt or hostile descriptor's arbitrary
  output address used to be dereferenced blindly; `table_at` answers `None`
  for an address the source never handed out, so `translate` reports `None`
  and `unmap` / `test_and_clear_accessed` / the access-flag fix-up report
  `NotMapped`.
* **An aliasing defect, fixed.** Each port's `AddressSpace` retained a
  `&'static mut` to its root table while the fault-time walk of the *active*
  root (`set_accessed_flag_in_active`) minted a second `&mut` to the same
  table. Miri's Stacked Borrows flagged it as soon as the provenance-clean
  recovery made the walk interpretable. A space now keeps only `root_phys`
  and reaches the root exactly as it reaches every other level.
* **The three paging walks are UB-clean, and x86_64's is host-testable.**
  `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p
  tairix-arch-{aarch64,riscv64} --lib paging` passes. x86_64's `paging`
  module was gated off the host entirely; it is now compiled there, which
  removed two `unreachable!()` production arms and let `mmu::conformance`,
  `frames::conformance`, and a `reclaim_table_frames` test run over its real
  pool for the first time.

**Miri stage enrolment was blocked by a different defect, now closed as
D121.** With the paging walks clean, the interpreter aborted next in
`context.rs`'s `TaskCtx::prepare`, which materialised a task's initial
stack frame from the `stack_top: u64` the Arch HAL handed it. That was the
HAL's own signature rather than a residue of this entry, so it is tracked
and fixed there; all three ports are now enrolled in
`tools/xtask/src/commands/miri.rs`'s `TARGETS`, so the gate interprets
these walks on every run instead of relying on a reviewer to remember.

## D122 — kthread admission aborts the kernel on an allocation failure
instead of failing closed (PARTIAL)

**Mechanism.** The charter requires allocation failure to be a `Result`,
never a panic. The kthread admission path did the opposite at every step:
`BoxStack::new` built its ~68 KiB stack with `alloc::vec!`, whose failure
path is `handle_alloc_error`, and `alloc_kernel_stack` then wrapped the
result in an infallible `Box::new`. A machine under real memory pressure
— exactly when the window-backed tier falls through to the `BoxStack`
fallback, because the frame pool is exhausted — therefore aborted the
kernel rather than refusing one spawn.

**Closed so far.** The stack itself, which is the allocation that actually
fails: `BoxStack::new` answers `None`, `alloc_kernel_stack` answers
`Option`, and the refusal is reported as `SchedError::OutOfMemory` →
`AdmitError::OutOfMemory` → `Errno::OutOfMemory`. Both call sites
(`threads.rs` thread creation, `syscalls.rs` loading-child admission)
already had an adjacent out-of-memory arm to return through.

**Still open.** The smaller allocations either side of it — the
`Box<dyn KernelStack + Send>` around the stack, the `ThreadControl` block,
the `Arc`s the admission path builds — still abort through the global
allocator's handler. Closing those needs a fallible boxing primitive and a
sweep of the admission path, which is its own change; a 16-byte `Box`
failing means the kernel is already dead, so the ordering here is
deliberate rather than an oversight.

**Done when:** no allocation on the admission path can abort — every one
is a value the caller fails closed on — with a test that drives each
failure point.

## D121 — `ContextSwitch::prepare` took the stack as a bare integer, so no
UB oracle could look at the paging ports (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** The Arch HAL's `ContextSwitch::prepare(ctx, stack_top: u64,
…)` handed each port the task's kernel stack as an address, so every port
synthesised a pointer from it (`let p = sp as *mut u64`) to write the
initial frame. Under `-Zmiri-strict-provenance` that is an int-to-pointer
cast with no provenance: the interpreter aborts on the first one and can
check nothing else in the crate. The three bare-metal ports were therefore
excluded from `cargo xtask ci`'s miri stage, and *any* change to
`kernel/arch/{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}/src/paging.rs` — the recently
provenance-cleaned walks of D56 — passed a green gate with no oracle
looking at it. The only thing standing between a new aliasing or
provenance bug and `main` was a reviewer remembering to run miri by hand.

Two further defects rode on the same signature:

* **`prepare` was a safe function that dereferenced a caller-supplied
  integer.** Anyone holding a `&dyn ContextSwitch` could corrupt arbitrary
  memory through entirely safe code.
* **`TooSmall` did not check what it claimed.** `if stack_top <
  FRAME_BYTES` tests the stack's *address* against the frame size — i.e.
  that the subtraction does not wrap below zero — not that the stack has
  room. A 32-byte stack at `0x1_0000` passed, and the port then wrote its
  frame straight through the bytes beneath it.

**Fix.** `prepare` takes a `KernelStackRegion` (`kernel/arch/api`): a
`NonNull<u8>` base plus a length. The pointer carries provenance for the
bytes the frame is written through, and the length makes `TooSmall` a
question about the stack. Constructing a region is the `unsafe` step — its
contract *is* the old `unsafe trait KernelStack` obligation — which is what
lets `prepare` stay safe: the proof travels with the value instead of
living in prose at each call site. `PrepareError::NullStack` is deleted
rather than re-checked: `NonNull` cannot name a null stack.

The two refusals every port owed were identical, so they are checked once
in `KernelStackRegion::seed_frame` and each port keeps only its own
`FRAME_BYTES` and frame layout. Three private `context::PrepareError`
enums and their three 1:1 `map_prepare_error` functions are gone with
them; the ports return the HAL's enum directly. `STACK_ALIGN` had five
copies (three ports, `kthread.rs`, `kstack.rs`) and now has one.

**What each stack source does with it.** `BoxStack` holds its allocation as
a raw pointer rather than a `Box<[u8]>`: a task writes its frames through
that pointer while the owner is only borrowed shared, and a `Box`
re-asserts uniqueness of its payload on every move — which happens once per
admission, when the stack is boxed into the control block — invalidating
the pointer the task is running on. The allocation is now taken with an
explicit `STACK_ALIGN` layout, so the usable top is the allocation's end
rather than a rounded-down approximation; that removed a second, smaller
defect, where `carries()` accepted up to 15 bytes *of the guard region* as
being on the task's stack, because `top` was rounded down while
`usable_bytes` was not. `WindowStack`'s pages are genuinely not a Rust
allocation — they exist because the kernel wrote page tables — so its
pointer is minted with `core::ptr::with_exposed_provenance_mut`, which
states that deliberately where a bare cast hid it. That path never runs
under miri (it needs a live remap window), so it weakens no oracle.

**What enrolling the ports then found — three real bugs in x86_64 AP
bring-up.** With `prepare` clean, the oracle reached `smp.rs` and stopped
three times.

*Uninitialised memory into the trampoline frame.*
`TrampolineFrame::write_slot` built the per-AP boot record's byte image
with `transmute_copy::<ApBootSlot, [u8; size_of::<ApBootSlot>()]>`. The
struct's fields end at `0x44` (68 bytes) but its size is 72 — it carries
four bytes of tail padding to its 8-byte alignment — so the copy read four
uninitialised bytes and wrote them into the frame every secondary CPU
boots from. It is now written field by field at `offset_of!`-derived
offsets, bounded by `AP_BOOT_SLOT_WIRE_LEN`, so only the contract with
`ap_trampoline.s` is written. Two stale claims in that module's docs went
with it: the write was documented as "field-by-field through a
volatile-aware path" when it was neither, and the ordering it claimed to
provide actually comes from the caller's explicit `fence(Release)` before
the SIPI.

*A rendezvous flag polled through a shared borrow.* `load_ready` took
`&self` and derived its `AtomicU32` from `self.frame[..].as_ptr()` —
read-only provenance for a location **another core writes** with an
`xchg`. Stacked Borrows rejects the retag, and the reason it matters in
the field is worse than the formalism: a pointer derived from a shared
borrow tells the compiler those bytes cannot change for the life of the
borrow, which licenses hoisting the load straight out of the BSP's
`while frame.load_ready() == 0` spin loop. The `Acquire` does not help if
the value is never re-read; the BSP would spin to its budget and report
`StartTimedOut` on a CPU that had in fact come up. `load_ready` now takes
`&mut self` and derives through `as_mut_ptr`, so the pointer carries the
write provenance the location's concurrent mutation demands. It survived
until now only because no optimiser had yet taken the licence.

*An alignment precondition that was documented, relied on, and never
checked.* With the provenance right, the oracle then rejected the
`AtomicU32` reference outright: unaligned. `TrampolineFrame::new` is a
safe constructor taking any `&mut [u8]`, and its `InstallError::
FrameMisaligned` variant is documented "`frame_base` was not 4 KiB
aligned" — but the check under that name tested the *length*, so the
alignment the whole module reads the frame at fixed sub-offsets on was
never verified. The long SAFETY comment on `load_ready` argued the point
away with reasoning that does not hold ("the alignment tracks the data,
not the slice"): an `AtomicU32` reference needs its *address* aligned, and
a `[u8; 4096]` has alignment 1. Production was safe by luck of the real
frame sitting at `0x8000`; the host fixtures were not. `new` now checks
size and alignment separately — `FrameWrongSize` and `FrameMisaligned`,
each doing what its name says — so the precondition is enforced at the one
place a caller can get it wrong, and the test fixtures use a
`#[repr(align(4096))]` frame as the hardware always did.

**And one more, a crate further out.** Pointing the same oracle at
`kernel/core`'s kthread suite — to check the new `BoxStack` really does
hand `prepare` write provenance — got twelve tests in and then stopped in
`kernel/mem`'s `ptr::offset_within`, the helper every `Slab` slot is
reached through. It computed `(base as usize).checked_add(offset)` and
returned `addr as *mut u8`: a round trip that **strips `base`'s
provenance**, so callers got a pointer the compiler believes aliases
nothing and may reorder or elide accesses through. Its own SAFETY comment
described pointer arithmetic ("the only place pointer arithmetic on `base`
is defined") that the code was not doing. `offset_within` and its sibling
`end_within` now keep the overflow guard on the address and apply it to
the *pointer* (`wrapping_add`), and the two synthetic near-`usize::MAX`
probes use `without_provenance_mut`, which is what that idiom is for.
`kernel/mem` is **not** enrolled in the miri stage — its 330-test
allocator suite is a runtime-budget question of its own — so this fix's
oracle is a targeted `cargo miri test -p tairix-kernel-mem --lib ptr::`
run (10 passed, strict provenance) rather than the gate. Enrolling that
crate is left open rather than done quietly (D123).

With that fixed the kthread suite ran three tests further and stopped at a
*third* pre-existing round-trip, `suspend_with`'s `data as *mut
ThreadControl`, where the per-CPU `ResumeHandle` publishes a control block
as a `usize` and its thunk casts it back. That is the resume seam's own
type erasure rather than anything this entry touches — and notably the
sibling `LiveSpacePtr`, in the same module, already carries a real pointer
with a doc explaining why. It is escalated as D124 rather than chased
here: two distinct pre-existing sites in as many runs is an open-ended
sweep, and fixing one more would still not make `kernel/core` gate-covered
while the crate stays unenrolled. What the fifteen tests that *did* pass
establish is the part this entry owns — `dispatch_step` driving the new
`BoxStack` region through `prepare`, interpreted clean under strict
provenance.

The riscv64 tests additionally reported 22 deliberate `Box::leak` pool
fixtures. Both sibling ports already build their test pools as a
function-local `static POOL: PageTablePool = PageTablePool::new()`, which
needs no allocation at all; riscv64 was the only port leaking, and now
uses the sibling pattern. No leak-tolerance flag was added to the miri
stage: a suite that leaks cannot tell a deliberate leak from a real one.

**Proved by.** `tairix-arch-{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}` are enrolled in
`tools/xtask/src/commands/miri.rs`'s `TARGETS`, so the gate now interprets
all three. Host tests cover `seed_frame`'s two refusals and its exact-fit
boundary, an empty region refusing every frame (the fail-closed
replacement for the deleted null-stack arm), each port's frame layout read
back *through its own buffer* rather than through the address `prepare`
reported, and `write_slot` leaving the frame past the wire contract
untouched.

## D63 — an ARXFS commit published its superblock slot with no barrier (FIXED)

**Where.** `drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/lib.rs` `ARXFS::commit`.

**Mechanism.** Commit wrote the transaction's copy-on-write blocks, then the
transaction root, then the superblock slot naming that root — and issued no
`Block::flush()` at any point. Only `map_persist`, reached from an explicit
`fs_sync`, ever forced the device cache.

Every device with a volatile write cache — every SD card, every consumer SSD,
every HDD — was therefore free to commit those writes to media in any order. The
damaging order is: the superblock slot and the transaction root reach media while
an interior B-tree node beneath that root does not. `open` re-validates the root
before accepting a slot, so a lost *root* falls back to the previous slot and is
survivable; a lost interior node beneath a **durable** root is not. Both mirror
copies of that node are absent, so the read fails closed and the volume does not
mount — a whole-volume loss recoverable only by `check` or `rescue`, from a
single power cut at the wrong microsecond.

**Severity.** Data loss on ordinary power failure, on the class of device the
Pi 4 boots from. It survived because every emulated device in the suite was
strictly ordered, so no existing test could observe it.

**Fix (item WB1 of `plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`).** One barrier per
commit: the transaction's blocks are staged in the dirty set
(`src/wcache.rs`), drained to the device at the commit point, `flush()`ed, and
only then is the slot written. One is sufficient — the root is just another
block that must be durable before the slot naming it — and a second is issued
only for an explicit `fs_sync`. The batching the dirty set brings is what makes
the barrier affordable: a 64 KiB write on a 512-byte volume costs 158 device
writes against 746.

Three further ordering defects the work exposed were fixed with it, each with
its own regression test: a commit that failed after its first slot copy
published the transaction while the caller rolled it back and freed the
published root's blocks; `scrub`/`check`/`health` propagated a failed `commit()`
without rolling back, so a later commit published the failed transaction's
trees; and the allocation map's clean→dirty stamp was not barriered before the
first page write, so a reordering device could leave a mount adopting a map
stamped clean at a generation it no longer described. All three are recorded in
`plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` §8 WB1.

**Proved by.** A volatile-write-cache device model
(`MemBlock::with_volatile_cache`): after a commit the only blocks it still holds
are the slot's two copies, and a power loss committing any subset of them leaves
the prior committed state or the new one, both whole. The WB0 command ledger
asserts the shape — exactly one barrier per commit, with nothing but that slot
pair after it — and the crash-replay sweeps still leave prior-or-new at every
write budget.

## D64 — ARXFS scrub's copy-repair write bypassed the read-only guard (FIXED)

**Where.** `drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/scrub.rs` `scrub_meta_into`, and the
missing gate on `ARXFS::scrub` / `ARXFS::health`.

**Mechanism.** One metadata read path serves every metadata class: read the
primary, fall back to the companion mirror, and repair the bad copy from the
good one. `read_meta` guarded that repair with `if !self.read_only`, and said
why — a read-only handle must never mutate the device. `scrub_meta_into`
performed the *same* repair with a bare `self.write_block(comp, …)` and no
guard, and neither `scrub` nor `health` called `deny_if_read_only` (only `trim`
did). The repair is a direct block write, not a transaction, so `commit`'s
read-only refusal did not catch it.

A read-only ARXFS handle therefore wrote to its device whenever a scrub — or any
scrub-path verification reached from `health` — found a repairable mirror. That
contradicted the guarantee the driver states for `/System`, and it was actively
dangerous in the state the flag exists for: a re-inserted volume whose
non-mutation could not be proven is mounted read-only *with its uncommitted
write set still held* (`plans/DEVICES.md` D4c) so that nothing touches a medium
whose contents are in doubt until an operator decides. A copy-repair there
mutates exactly that medium, and the retained-write replay decision is then
being made about a device the filesystem has already altered.

**Severity.** A read-only guarantee that did not hold, on the one path where
"read-only" is a data-preservation decision rather than a policy one. Reachable
only by an explicit `scrub`/`health` call on a read-only handle, which nothing
in production makes yet; it becomes systematically reachable the moment the
maintenance runner exists, which is why it was fixed ahead of it.

**Fix (item M1 of `plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`).** The mirror
copy-repair is one method, `ARXFS::repair_meta_copy`, which a read-only handle
declines — so the rule the three repair-on-read sites each spelled for
themselves, and this one did not, is stated once and cannot be forgotten again.
A read-only scrub writes nothing at all: no copy-repair, no refcount correction,
no cursor, no cleared progress record, no transaction; `health` skips only its
durable baseline and returns the reading it took.

The finding survives the fix rather than being traded for it. A mirror the pass
may not rewrite is `ScrubReport::metadata_damaged`, never a repair that did not
happen, and it reaches the health classification, because a copy that went bad
is the same medium signal whether or not the handle could rewrite it — a
read-only volume with degraded mirrors reports `Degraded`, not a clean bill.

**Also fixed, found by the same reading, each with its own regression test.**
Two more read-only writes sat on the same path and failed the whole call rather
than reporting: a bounded pass died at the cursor it may not persist (the exact
call the maintenance runner drives), and a pass that finished one a read-write
mount had paused died at the progress record it may not clear — which would also
have dropped, in memory only, a reference the committed root still names.
`ScrubReport::complete` became `ScrubReport::pass`, the three states that
actually exist, because a bounded pass that kept no position is a different
audit fact (`PassVerdict::Stopped`, with its own event ID) from one that will be
resumed: repeating the first never reaches past its own budget. And
`CheckReport::structure` is a public field whose type could not be named by a
consumer; `StructureVerdict` is exported.

---

## D65 — ARXFS's B-tree insert recursed 8 KiB of stack per tree level (FIXED)

**Where.** `drivers/filesystem/arxfs/src/btree.rs` `btree_insert_rec` (with
`btree_insert_leaf`), and the depth-unbounded descent they shared.

**Mechanism.** Insert descended by recursion, and each level kept two
block-sized buffers live *across* the recursive call: the node it was editing,
and a second one it read the child back into afterwards, only to recover the
child's minimum key for the separator. A split added a third. One level of
`btree_insert_rec` reserved 8360 bytes on the release build for x86_64. The
kernel hosts this driver on 32 KiB per-thread stacks behind a 4 KiB guard page,
and one `write_at` performs several nested tree mutations, so the overrun did
not need a deep tree: measured with a stack probe on the release build, one
write to a fragmented file used **48 097** bytes over a three-level extent tree
and **34 633** over a single leaf. Nothing bounded the depth on that path
either, so a corrupt child pointer leading back to an ancestor recursed until
the guard page caught it.

**Fix (item A1 of `plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`).** `btree_insert` and
`btree_remove` are iterative: one descent records the path, the leaf is edited
in place, and each ancestor is rewritten on the way back up, taking the child's
minimum key from the step that just wrote it instead of reading the node back.
The node buffers live in one `TreeEdit` scratch the mount lends per mutation, so
none reaches the stack; the per-record `Vec` decode the remove path performed at
every level is gone with `btree_load_entries`; and every level re-entered on the
way up is validated at `child_level + 1`, so the write path refuses a cyclic or
over-deep tree as the read descent does.

**Measured after.** The same write uses **11 633** bytes over the three-level
tree and **11 609** over the single leaf, the difference no longer scaling with
depth; what remains is the driver's own on-stack block staging down the write
path, not the tree edit, whose frames are 904 and 968 bytes. Removing one extent
from an 800-extent tree allocated 596 times and now allocates 118. Device reads
are unchanged per insert and one fewer per remove.

**Also fixed, found by the same reading.** The merge of two empty siblings
indexed into an empty entry list and **panicked** on the write path of a corrupt
volume; it is a fail-closed device fault, with a regression test. And
`btree_insert` copied the caller's value with `copy_from_slice`, so a record of
the wrong width would have panicked rather than been refused.

**Left to its owner, not deferred.** The whole `write_at` chain still spends
~11.6 KiB of stack in block-sized staging buffers (`write_file`,
`store_cluster`, `map_write`, `commit`). It is constant, inside the 32 KiB
budget, and now guarded by a test — but it is sized by `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`, so item
**B1**, which widens the filesystem block size, must move that staging off the
stack in the same change; recorded in that item.

## D84 — the sleeping mutex lost a contender that published after its release scanned the queue — DONE

**Symptom.** `stress_qemu_aarch64` fell silent for its whole 300 s inactivity
budget, its transcript ending at `id=4139 root-unlock: users database
installed; login can authenticate`, a few per cent of the time under host
contention. Recorded under D13 as a second manifestation of the masked-section
hard lockup because of the "total silence across every core" signature.

**It is not a wedge — every core is idle.** The QEMU runner now reads each
vCPU's registers off the monitor before it kills a hung guest and names the
addresses against the kernel ELF (`tools/qemu`); on this stall all four cores
sit at `exceptions::wait_for_interrupt` inside `init::run_dispatch_loop`.
Nothing spins, nothing holds an interrupt-masked section: the machine has
genuinely run out of runnable work, so the ~1 Hz watchdog cadence wakes each
core, finds nothing, and idles again — for ever, and silently, because a
quiescent system has nothing to report.

**Where it stops.** The transcript carries no `id=11001 application bundle
loaded` at all, so no boot service ever read its image off the volume. Guest
instrumentation placed all seven loading children past the application-store
readiness latch and inside the bundle read, blocked on the `/System` mount's
`SleepLock`; the head of that queue was blocked one layer down on the shared
boot disk's device `SleepLock`, with the lock word **free**. The in-kernel
unlock kthread reads the same disk through its own window and is unaffected
because it does not go through the VFS mount — which is why the unlock
completes and only then does everything stop.

**Mechanism.** `SleepLock`'s contended release decided "nobody is waiting"
from a wait-queue scan and *then* cleared the whole lock word. A contender
that registered in that window had already read `LOCKED` as set — so it
committed to park — and had published `CONTENDED` into the very word the
clear wiped. Every later release then matched the one-compare-exchange fast
path (`LOCKED -> 0`, no contention bit) and never consulted the queue again,
so the contender slept on a free lock with no wake owed to it by anyone. The
module's own no-fence argument ("flag and lock bit share one location, so
their modification order is total") is sound for the fast path, which is
itself a read-modify-write of that word; it does not extend to a blind store
of the word issued after a separate structure was read.

**Fix.** The slow path releases before it decides
(`SleepLock::release_and_recheck`): it clears `LOCKED` only — keeping any
`CONTENDED` a late contender set — and then reads the queue a second time.
That is the mirror of the contender's register-then-test, so whichever of the
two read-modify-writes on the word runs second observes the first and the two
orders cannot both miss. A contender the second look finds has the lock
retaken for it, so the FIFO handoff is unchanged; only a second look that is
also empty drops `CONTENDED`, keeping the uncontended release one
compare-exchange. Regression guard (host, `kernel/core`):
`a_contender_publishing_after_the_queue_scan_is_still_woken` drives the two
halves of the release with the contender placed in the window between them,
and fails against the pre-fix tail.

**Arch-neutral**: `kernel/core/src/sleeplock.rs` is shared by every port.

---

## D66 — one `DriverError` spoke for three filesystem conflicts at once (FIXED)

**Where.** `lib/abi/src/driver/mod.rs` `DriverError::Busy`, its use across
`arxfs`, `adfs`, `ext4`, `fat32` and `kernel/core/src/fs/memfs.rs`, and the
per-operation mappings in `kernel/core/src/fs/delegate.rs`.

**Mechanism.** `Busy` meant "a name is already taken", "this directory is not
empty", "this move would make a directory its own descendant", and its
documented "retryable transient" — with nothing in the value saying which. The
VFS recovered the meaning from *which mapper the call site picked*:
`map_link_error` read it as `AlreadyExists`, `map_rename_error` as `NotEmpty`,
and the generic `map_driver_error` as `Io`. So `VfsDelegate::create` and
`VfsDelegate::remove`, whose own pre-checks answer `AlreadyExists` and
`NotEmpty` correctly, each reported a conflict that arose between that check
and the driver call as an **I/O error**; a self-descending rename was reported
as "directory not empty", advice to empty a destination that emptying could
never make lawful; and because `Busy.as_errno()` is
`Errno::WouldBlock`, any consumer reaching a filesystem driver without the
VFS's per-operation mapping saw `EWOULDBLOCK` where a coreutils-faithful
`mkdir`/`ln`/`rmdir` needs `EEXIST`/`ENOTEMPTY`.

**Fix (item D66 of `plans/IMPLEMENT-OUTSTANDING-ARXFS.md`).** `DriverError`
gains `AlreadyExists` (19), `DirectoryNotEmpty` (20) and `DirectoryCycle` (21),
each mapping to the `Errno` its condition already had (`AlreadyExists`,
`NotEmpty`, and — `abi-v1` having no `EINVAL` — `OutOfRange`). Every driver
site now names the conflict it met, `Busy` keeps only the transient it
documents, and `map_rename_error` is deleted: `map_driver_error` is one total
mapping every call site shares, leaving `map_link_error` a single override for
the one code whose meaning really is surface-specific (`Unsupported` — "this
format stores no such object" on the link surface). `VfsError` gains
`DirectoryCycle` so the in-kernel record stays precise. In-place, with no shim.

**Also fixed, found by the same reading.** The generated C header's
driver-error table was hand-maintained with no completeness guard and had
already drifted three variants behind `lib/abi` (`MediumError`,
`DeviceOffline`, `TooManyLinks` were unnameable from C). It is now
`DRIVER_ERROR_NAMES` beside `ERRNO_NAMES`, with the same dense-`1..=N` table
test, so a variant cannot be dropped from the C view again — and both tables
additionally round-trip every emitted code through `from_i32`, so an entry
whose decode arm is missing fails too. And `TooManyLinks`, reachable only
through `map_link_error`, would have become `Io` on any other surface; it is
in the shared mapping now.

**Not changed, and checked rather than assumed.** `DriverError::Unsupported`
is also read differently per surface, but no misreport is reachable through
it: the VFS resolves the parent before delegating (so "not a directory" cannot
arrive at the link mapping), refuses a directory operand itself, and never
passes `NodeKind::Symlink` to `create`. `mount`/`unmount` keep `Busy` — an
already-mounted volume and one with open files are the resource-in-use `EBUSY`
the code is for.

## D68 — a guard-arena block could only recycle when it drained completely, so the boot arena was stranded and the capacity ratcheted (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `tairix_kernel::stack_arena` hands each kthread kernel stack
out of a guard-arena block through a forward bump cursor, and could rewind
that cursor only when the *whole* block was idle (`live == 0`). A handful of
long-lived boot kthreads sit in the boot-carved block for the life of the
system, so it never goes idle: every region handed back to it was lost, the
cursor reached the block end after `capacity` spawns, and from then on the
arena chained a fresh 2 MiB block out of the frame allocator. The
one-free-block grace keeps one such chained block resident permanently, so
the boot arena's RAM was consumed once and never reused and the arena's
capacity tracked a system's spawn *history* instead of its live stacks. The
ratchet has no bound under concurrent spawn load: any block whose live count
never reaches zero is stranded the same way, one 2 MiB block at a time.

**How it surfaced, and the arithmetic.** `tests/integration/memsoak_program`
repeats one identical cycle — spawn and reap a `true.app` child, park on a
timed `stream_read` whose bound elapses, walk the self-scoped process list,
ride a sysinfod IPC round trip — and requires the system-wide
`KernelMemoryStats.free_bytes` to return to its baseline byte for byte. On
the QEMU `virt` guest the boot arena is RAM/64 ≈ 4 MiB, which after its
header page holds 60 regions of `4 KiB guard + 64 KiB debug stack`; boot's own
kthreads take about ten, so the ~50th child exhausted the block and drew
exactly one 2 MiB chained block. Sampling `free_bytes` between the cycle's
steps over 128 cycles put that single 2 MiB step in the spawn/reap step and
showed nothing else: it is a staircase with a long period, not the
per-cycle leak the first reading of the figures suggested.

**The fix.** Each block keeps a free list of the regions handed back to it
(`BlockHeader::free_head`), threaded through the freed regions themselves, and
`alloc` pops that list before advancing the bump cursor — so a block with live
stacks recycles, the boot block never exhausts, and no chained block is drawn
at all under a serial spawn/exit workload. Consequences that are part of the
contract:

- A returned region is **zeroed** before it is threaded: a kthread stack can
  hold spilled capability tokens, and the previous design's only scrub was on
  whole-block release, so a region recycled out of an idle chained block was
  handed to its next owner unscrubbed.
- The link and its free marker live in the first bytes of the region's
  *usable* area, never the guard page: on aarch64 the guard page is unmapped
  at that same address in the exiting task's own root, so writing it could
  fault.
- Three O(1) fail-closed guards replace the single "the block's live count is
  zero" test: a region at or above the bump cursor was never handed out, a
  zero live count cannot be decremented, and a region whose marker already
  says free is refused rather than linked twice (which would hand one region
  to two owners).
- The idle-block cursor reset is gone — it would now hand out a region that is
  also on the free list.

The seam that reads and writes arena RAM (`ArenaMemory`, formerly
`BlockStore`) covers the region marker as well as the block header, so the
host tests model both and the production identity-mapped store and the host
double share one `FreeRegion::is_free` predicate.

**Regression cover.** The `memsoak` vertical is the end-to-end regression: it
failed before the fix and now reports `MEMSOAK PASS baseline=181182464
final=181182464 cycles=32`. Host unit tests pin the mechanism directly —
`a_block_with_a_live_stack_still_recycles_its_returned_regions` (the block
recycles 32 rounds through a 4-region block with one region pinned, and no
block is chained), `a_returned_region_is_scrubbed_before_it_is_reused`,
`double_free_inside_a_live_block_is_refused`, and
`freeing_a_never_allocated_region_is_refused`.

**What the hunt ruled out.** The kernel heap was not involved: at the time no
QEMU test-kernel bin published its `#[global_allocator]`, so
`install_frame_heap_source` was a no-op in every vertical and the heap drew no
frames at all there (that publication gap is D69, now fixed). The reap path's task-keyed maps are not involved
either — `AddressSpaceRegistry::withdraw`'s `stale_task_entry` tripwire is a
`debug_assert` and the verticals are debug builds, and the live process count
was flat across the soak. The remaining 8 KiB step the pre-fix figures showed
belongs to `timed`, whose address space gains two pages once when it wakes
inside the measured window; that was the fixture's system-wide sampling, not
the cycle, and is fixed as D70.

## D69 — no QEMU test kernel published its allocator, so the growable kernel heap was inert in every vertical (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `plans/FIX-KHEAP.md` made the kernel heap grow on demand
through two seams: a bin published its `#[global_allocator]` with
`tairix_kernel_core::kheap::register_global_heap`, and the boot path then
wired the frame-backed growth source into it with `install_frame_heap_source`.
Only `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/main.rs` called the first. **None of the QEMU
test-kernel bins did**, and `install_frame_heap_source` returned early when no
heap had been published — so in every vertical the heap was silently capped at
its 64 MiB `.bss` bootstrap region, the byte-granular tier never grew a region
and the slab tier never drew a frame. Nothing had hit it because 64 MiB is
ample for a vertical, and the growth and slab-page paths therefore had no
end-to-end coverage at all: every claim about them rested on host unit tests
over a non-allocating page-table double, which is exactly the gap that plan's
"deliberate carve-outs" names.

**The fix: delete the seam, not add a 129th place to remember it.** The heap
is now a **required** `BootInfo` field, handed over from the bin through
`boot`. `register_global_heap`, its `AtomicPtr` slot, and its accessor are
gone, and so is the fail-open early return: `install_frame_heap_source` takes
the heap it installs into. `#[global_allocator]` can only be declared by the
final binary, so a parameter is the strongest available guarantee — the
compiler refuses a bin that does not name its heap, and the one place the
wiring happens is a library body no bin can skip. Every kernel bin (the
production binary, ~45 verticals, and the two shared boot-harness macros) now
hands its allocator over.

The same handover made the reported heap size truthful.
`KernelMemoryStats::kernel_heap_bytes` was a `u64` snapshot the *aarch64* port
alone threaded from `tairix_kalloc::HEAP_BYTES` — the bootstrap constant, so
it never moved once the heap started growing, and it was `0` on x86_64 and
riscv64. It is now read live from the heap (`FreeListAllocator::capacity`) by
both the System Information introspection source and the pre-boot Supervisor's
`mem`, so `with_kernel_heap_bytes` and the per-port threading are deleted.

**What it uncovered.** Installing the source put live kernel-heap objects in
frames drawn from the pool for the first time, which broke every x86_64
fixture whose translation root identity-mapped only the low 32 MiB — a
violation of the port's own stated window invariant that had been harmless
only while the heap sat entirely low. That is D71, fixed alongside.

**Regression cover.** `tests/integration/kheap_growth` is one arch-neutral
exercise the three boot-completed verticals drive after `BootCompleted`: it
requests one page past the heap's free remainder (nothing already mapped can
serve that, so it must come from a fresh region), checks the capacity rose,
writes and reads back a marker on **every page** of the assembled run, frees
it so the drained region drives `shrink`, then repeats — a teardown that
stranded window address space or left a stale leaf cannot serve the same
request twice. It is the guest-side half the host tests cannot reach: nothing
maps a window address on the host. Measured on all three ports: a ~63 MiB
region grown out of a fragmented pool, every page dereferenced, and capacity
settling back at exactly the bootstrap figure. Host-side,
`capacity_tracks_the_bootstrap_then_every_grown_region` (`lib/kalloc`) pins the
accessor and `the_kernel_memory_domain_reports_the_heap_size_it_reads_now`
(`kernel/core`) pins the live reading.

## D70 — the memsoak fixture judged a figure any process could move, so an unrelated service's allocation failed it (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `tests/integration/memsoak_program` compared the system-wide
`KernelMemoryStats.free_bytes` before and after its measured window and
required byte equality. `free_bytes` counts every frame the machine has handed
out, so the sample conflated the kernel memory the cycle failed to return —
what the soak is for — with user memory *any other process* allocated during
the window. On a live boot those exist: sampling per cycle over 128 cycles
attributed an 8 KiB step to `timed`, whose address space gains two pages once
when an NTP wake lands inside the window, at a pid the cycle never touches.
The window is ~190 ms and `timed` wakes every few seconds, so this was a
timing-dependent failure of a few percent per run — a pass was not evidence
the next run passes, and no `WARMUP_CYCLES` length excludes an event driven by
wall time rather than by cycle count.

**The fix.** The sample is `free_bytes + user_resident_bytes +
kernel_heap_bytes` (`tairix_test_memsoak::sample_bytes`). A page moving
between the free pool and either a user address space or the kernel heap
leaves that sum unchanged, while memory the cycle failed to return to any of
the three still lowers it, so the byte-exact verdict is untouched and now
judges only the quantity it is meaningful over. No tolerance band was
introduced: the fixture's own reasoning against one — it would let a slow leak
pass N cycles and fail N+M — stands.

The heap term joined once D69 made the growable-heap source live in every
vertical. The heap then draws frames from the pool: whole regions on growth,
and one page per slab size class kept back as anti-thrash hysteresis — a
bounded one-time retention that can land in any cycle, measured or not, and
did (a 3-page shortfall over 32 cycles). Those frames are owned and reusable,
not lost, and `kernel_heap_bytes` is now the heap's live capacity (also D69),
so counting it makes each such move invisible to the verdict while a genuine
loss still shows.

`KernelMemoryStats::user_resident_bytes` is live to make that possible. It was
an honest `0` ("per-space resident accounting has no live accounter yet"); it
is now the summed mapped pages of every registered address space, derived per
record by the one `resident_bytes` the per-process rows already used, so the
aggregate and the rows cannot drift apart. It is the same walk
`IntrospectSource::processes` performs, on a capability-gated diagnostic query,
and it discloses nothing `total_bytes - free_bytes` did not already. Its
consumers (`sysmon`'s memory bar, `switchboard`, `sysinfo`, `top`) were already
written against a live value and simply become truthful.

**Regression cover.** Host tests in the fixture library pin the property
directly: `a_page_moving_into_a_user_address_space_leaves_the_sample_unchanged`
(the case that used to fail the soak),
`a_frame_moving_into_the_kernel_heap_leaves_the_sample_unchanged` (the case
that used to fail it after D69), `a_page_retained_outside_every_accounted_
owner_lowers_the_sample` (the case that still must), and
`the_sample_saturates_rather_than_wrapping`.

## D71 — eleven x86_64 fixtures ran on a root that identity-mapped only 32 MiB, so kernel memory above it was unreachable (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** The x86_64 port publishes one window through which the kernel
reaches every frame by pointer, and its own doc stated the invariant: that
figure is carried by **every** translation root, read by every root
constructor. Kernel code runs with the current task's root active, so a root
that maps less strands every kernel address above its own ceiling while it is
loaded. (D56 later moved that window out of the low half; the invariant is
the same and the constructors carry it the same way.)

`AddressSpace::new_identity_first_32mib` let a caller build exactly such a
root, and eleven QEMU fixtures activated one. It was harmless only by luck:
the byte-granular heap consumes its `.bss` arena from the bottom, and boot
leaves barely 1.5 MiB live, so every kernel-heap object happened to sit below
32 MiB. Two of those fixtures had already met the problem locally and worked
around it with a private `IDENTITY_GIB = 4` copy of the port's figure; seven
more carried a private LAPIC identity mapping (two with their own copy of the
LAPIC base) because the page at ~3.98 GiB fell outside their narrow window.
Two more picked probe addresses — 1 GiB, 2 GiB — precisely *because* they were
"well outside the 32 MiB identity-mapped boot region", which the real window
covers.

D69's fix armed it. Once the growable-heap source is installed the slab tier
draws a frame per page through the direct map, and the frame allocator hands
out RAM above `__kernel_end` (past the 64 MiB `.bss` heap, so ~70 MiB up), so
the first page-class allocation after the install put live kernel-heap objects
far above 32 MiB. `spawn_program_qemu_x86_64` and `mem_map_qemu_x86_64` then
faulted with no local cause the instant they switched `CR3`; the other nine
were latently broken and passed only on whether they happened to touch a high
object while their root was loaded — luck, not correctness.

**The fix: the extent stopped being a caller's choice.** Every constructor
of a root that will be made live installs the window itself, so a caller
cannot under-map it. The one narrow constructor left is
`new_bookkeeping_identity_32mib`, documented for a space that is **never made
live** — the two MMIO register-window maps use one purely as page-table
bookkeeping, and their window base sits *inside* the identity window, so those
genuinely need a narrow root. Consequently:

- Every fixture that activates a root now carries the same window production
  does, and the two private `IDENTITY_GIB` copies are deleted.
- The seven LAPIC identity mappings and their two duplicated base constants
  are deleted: the window covers that page, which is why production never
  needed them. They had also become *failures* rather than redundancies —
  `map_4k` will not shatter the window's huge leaf.
- The isolation fixture's secret address and the accessed-bit fixture's probe
  and never-mapped addresses are derived from the port's published identity
  extent instead of hard-coded, so a wider window cannot quietly bring them
  back inside it — the same staleness that caused this defect.
- `POOL_SIZE` is derived from the per-root page-table cost
  (`PAGES_PER_LIVE_ROOT`) rather than a hand-picked 24 sized for the narrow
  root, and a window wider than the boot floor makes the constructor fail
  closed rather than return a root with holes.

**Regression cover.** The verticals themselves: every one of the eleven now
exercises a root carrying the real window, so the fault the two hit is
foreclosed for all of them, and a future fixture cannot reintroduce it without
reaching for a constructor whose name says it must never run.

## D72 — one iconbar click opened two terminal windows on a Pi 4B: the pointing device emitted a second press (CLOSED)

**State:** **closed.** The pointing device genuinely reported a second press,
and every layer TAIRiX owns reported it faithfully. The operator can now
suppress such chatter with `input.mouse.debounce` (default 25 ms, `0` to
disable). Kept as a worked example of the diagnosis, because the symptom looked
exactly like a desktop double-dispatch and was not one.

**Symptom as reported.** Early in a graphical session on a Raspberry Pi 4B,
with `terminal.app` already running, a single primary click on its icon-bar
slot opened *two* windows. A deliberate long press separated them: one window
appeared on the mouse-down, a second on the release. It settled after a while
within the same session, and a quick click sometimes produced one window and
sometimes two. QEMU never showed it.

**Ruled out by reading the code.** The bar acts on an app slot from
`press_primary` alone (`taskbar/src/input.rs`); `release_primary` resolves only
the Switchboard capsule gesture. The seat routes each event to exactly one
router and pins the release to the surface that took the press. `fold_outcome`
folds only motion and scroll. `relay_app_bar` → `deliver_app_event` resolves one
endpoint. `Port::send` is atomic. The terminal turns one `AppBarDefault` into
one `open_window`. Every stage is exactly-once.

**Ruled out by the device's own Report Descriptor.** The pointer interface
declares **no Report ID** and one 7-byte input report (buttons 8×1 @0, X/Y 16
bits @8/@24, wheel @40, AC Pan @48), so the parsed map matches the descriptor
field for field and there is no sibling collection on that endpoint to
mis-demux. The button diff emits a press only on a `0→1` transition, so a
single driver instance over that report stream cannot emit two presses for one
hold, whatever is dropped, delayed, or duplicated. Exactly one `usb_mouse`
process is loaded, and each interface holds its own `shm_create` region, so
there is no second injector and no cross-interface buffer sharing.

**Ruled out for the sibling interface.** The mouse's companion interface
(vendor `0xFF18` + consumer + a 10-slot keyboard collection under Report IDs
1/3/4) is bound by `usb_kbd`. Boot-decoding its ID-prefixed reports would
fabricate held modifiers and key usages — the fail-open D-class hazard the
`GET_PROTOCOL` read-back now closes — but fabricated *keys* cannot open a
terminal window: `EventOutcome::NewWindow` has exactly two producers,
`WindowEvent::AppBarDefault` and an `AppBarMenu` row resolving to
`BarCommand::NewWindow`, and the terminal binds no keyboard shortcut to it.

**Reproduced, and localised to the input path.** Two captures with
`APP_BAR_RELAYED` armed each show one click producing **two** relays, and the
gap between them equals how long the button was held:

| capture | relay 1 | relay 2 | gap | gesture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 547.939 | 549.070 | 1131 ms | long press |
| B | 700.653 | 700.730 | 77 ms | quick click |

So one relay fires on the mouse-down and one on the mouse-up, exactly as first
reported. It is not a consequence of the first window appearing: in capture B
relay 2 preceded that window's first frame, and in capture A it followed it.

**Not load-gated.** Roughly nine windows were on screen in both captures — the
`window=` field of the shown-window record is a never-reused *identifier*, not
a count of open windows, so its three-digit values say only how many windows
the session had created over its life. Relay-to-first-frame latency was
uniform in capture B (116–171 ms across nine windows, including the doubled
pair); capture A carried a single 1121 ms outlier at the doubling against
121–192 ms elsewhere. One outlier in one capture and none in the other means a
stall is a coincidence, not a precondition.

`TaskbarResponse::AppDefault` is constructed at exactly one line
(`taskbar/src/input.rs`), from `activate_app`, called from exactly one place,
inside `press_primary`'s `Hit::App` arm — reachable only from
`InputEvent::PointerPressed { button: Primary }`. `release_primary` resolves
only the Switchboard capsule gesture. So **two relays mean two `Pressed`
records reached the router**: the release is arriving as a second press, and
the duplication is at or below the seat, not in the desktop.

**The driver injected two presses.** A temporary trace of the button edges the
class driver injects (since removed, with the provenance trace below) showed
that for one physical click it injected `pressed, released,
pressed, released`. The capture showing the natural spacing:

```
131.684  pressed    -> relay 1
131.780  released           (96 ms hold, an ordinary click)
131.796  pressed    -> relay 2   (+16 ms)
131.812  released           (+16 ms)
```

The other capture logged `released, pressed, released` inside one millisecond —
the same sequence drained as a catch-up burst after the driver fell ~16 ms
behind. So the report stream reaching `BootMouse` carries `1, 0, 1, 0` within
one hold; the decoder emits a press only on a `0→1` edge, so it reported
faithfully. **The duplication is at or below the class driver**, and the desktop
reading above is confirmed rather than refuted. Every other click in both
captures is a clean single pair (64–160 ms hold).

**Two causes remain, indistinguishable at the class driver.** A 16 ms re-press
after release is textbook mechanical contact bounce, and the fastest deliberate
human double-click is 60–100 ms between presses, so it cannot be intentional.
But a duplicate xHCI completion that re-delivers a transfer slot's stale bytes
produces the identical `1, 0, 1, 0`: the slot still holds the press report, the
controller completes the TRB again without writing, and the decode copies the
stale bytes out as a fresh press.

**A temporary provenance trace separated the two.** The engine recorded each
*edge* report's transfer slot, completion code, residual, length, and the bytes
as the controller wrote them, and the HCD logged what it drained after every
report pump. Only reports whose lead byte changed were recorded — the button
bitmap of a normalised mouse report, the modifier set of a keyboard's — so
motion could not flood it. The readings it distinguished:

* two `0x01`-lead captures from the **same slot with identical bytes** — a
  controller completion re-delivered stale bytes, which would have been ours;
* two from **different slots**, the second carrying its own displacement — the
  device genuinely reported again;
* one `0x01` capture against two injected presses — a fault in the URB
  transport or the driver between them.

Both traces were **removed once they had answered the question**: they logged a
line per button edge, which is noise on every click and leaves an input-timing
record in the journal for no standing benefit. The one-per-enumeration
descriptor dump and the one-per-user-action icon-bar relay record stay. To
re-run this diagnosis, re-add an edge-gated provenance trace at
`UsbDevice::decode_transfer_report` and drain it from the HCD's report pump —
the slot is the field that matters.

**Not caused by anything in this change.** The Report-ID demux fix is provably
a no-op for a descriptor with no Report IDs, and the `GET_PROTOCOL` read-back
never runs for an interface whose descriptor yields a map — so neither touches
this pointer's path. The same work did add roughly six extra control transfers
during HID enumeration, which shifts timing, and an interval of sessions did
not reproduce; that is consistent with a race whose window moved, not one that
closed.

**Standing detector.** `APP_BAR_RELAYED` (`20_007`, "icon-bar action relayed to
its application") is emitted once per relay with the target's `ProcId` and
whether the action was `default` or `menu`. It instruments the *whole*
window-opening surface: both producers route through `relay_app_bar`, so a
recurrence is self-diagnosing. Two relays a few milliseconds apart mean two
presses reached the bar and the duplication is upstream of it; one relay
against two windows would mean the duplication is inside the application. An
`action=menu` line would mean a secondary press opened the app menu and the
release of that same press chose a row.

**Verdict: the device emitted the second press.** The provenance trace settled
it on the transfer slot:

```
30.243  slot 12  raw=01000000000000   press    <- the real click, 80 ms wide
30.323  slot 13  raw=00000000000000   release
30.339  slot 14  raw=01000000000000   press    <- +16 ms, 32 ms wide
30.371  slot  0  raw=00000000000000   release
```

Slots advance 12 → 13 → 14 → 0 — four consecutive **fresh** transfers, none
repeated (0 is the wrap past the link TRB). A completion re-delivering a slot's
stale bytes would have shown slot 12 twice, because that is where the press
report's bytes live. Instead the controller performed a genuine fourth transfer
and the device wrote a second press into slot 14. Every real click in the
capture is 64–128 ms wide; the spurious pulse is 32 ms wide, 16 ms after the
release — a contact-bounce signature. `code=13` (Short Packet), `residual=9`,
`len=7` are identical on every report, which is normal for a seven-byte report
armed to a sixteen-byte capture.

The *bytes* would not have discriminated: the real press also carries zero
displacement, because the pointer was stationary. Only the slot did. A future
investigation of a duplicated input should read the slot first.

**Superseded by an operator-settable chatter filter.** On the evidence above the
device is at fault, and the chain from controller completion to the terminal
reported it faithfully — but the operator now has a way to suppress it:
`input.mouse.debounce` (25 ms by default, `0` to disable) drops a press inside
that window of the same button's release, and the release closing that pulse
with it, at the seat. The rapid-fire objection is why zero must remain
available and why the filter is settable rather than fixed: a device emitting
deliberate click pairs at ~10 ms is reporting real intent. The decode layer
still conditions nothing (`docs/src/lib/hid.md`); the filter lives at the seat,
the one funnel every injector passes through.

The original chain analysis, unchanged: from
controller completion through the HCD capture, report FIFO, URB transport,
`BootMouse` decode, seat ring, session drain, taskbar and relay to the terminal
reported exactly what the device sent.

The intermittency is the switch's, not a race: whole sessions pass cleanly and
frame latency was normal throughout the capture that doubled.

Do not close this on a further absence of reproduction: a defect that stops
appearing is not a defect that has been explained.

## D73 — a woken task was placed level with the ready population, so the id tie-break starved every task spawned after a set of CPU hogs (FIXED)

**Symptom.** On `stress_qemu_aarch64` the shell spawns `sysmon` while
`stress --cpu 10 --timeout 120s` saturates four CPUs, and the monitor first
renders 59–120 s later. Measured, from one transcript's own `APP_LOADED`
records:

```
[  0.485] bundle loaded netstack.app  load=0.206358144s   read_bytes=599876
[126.677] bundle loaded sysmon.app    load=120.206524624s read_bytes=591615
```

Two near-identical byte counts, a 583x difference. `verify` was 1.2 ms in
both, so the whole cost was the read; the read began at t≈6.47 s and ended
0.2 s after the load generator exited — i.e. it made *no* progress while the
hogs ran and then took its normal unloaded time.

**Mechanism.** `RunQueue::admit_weight` returned
`max(smallest ready vruntime, min_vruntime)` — deliberately the **leftmost
ready entry**. That guarantees the joiner *ties* with the very task that
would otherwise be picked next, and the ready set is a
`BTreeSet<(vruntime, TaskId)>`, so a tie is settled by **task id**. A task
that wakes among a CPU-bound population it was spawned after therefore has a
higher id than all of them and loses the pick to every one of them, on every
single wake. It is deterministic, not probabilistic: the same transcript
shows the ten hogs at ids `0x0f`–`0x18`, the `sysmon` loading child at
`0x19` (behind all ten), and `timed` at `0x0a` — which is why `timed`'s IPC
round trips kept completing in ~10 ms throughout while the child starved.

A bundle load reads every file in the bundle to hash it (`AppInfo`, `Run`,
the whole `Help/` tree across 13 locales, `Resources/`), so it is on the
order of a thousand serial block round trips, each parking and waking. At
one full scheduling round per wake (~10 hogs x ~12 ms) that is the observed
~120 s. Nothing about it is specific to bundle loading: any I/O-bound task
that wakes repeatedly paid a full round per round trip.

**Why the existing tests missed it.** `short_interactive_wakes_stay_
responsive_among_cpu_hogs` bounded the wake latency at
`HOG_TICKS * HOGS + 1` — a full round behind every hog — so it *documented*
the defect as acceptable. The bound is now one hog's slice.

**Fix.** `admit_weight` returns `min_vruntime.saturating_sub(SLEEPER_CREDIT)`
— one unit of service ahead of the monotonic floor, the CFS `place_entity`
sleeper credit — so a joiner sorts **strictly** before the running
population and the id tie-break never decides the pick. The head start
cannot accumulate: the floor advances only to a *picked* task's vruntime,
placement is absolute against it, every dispatch charges at least one credit
back, and `admit`'s existing `front.max(task.vruntime())` still lets a task
that has earned a higher vruntime keep it. A task migrating on yield is
unaffected for that reason — its own charged vruntime already exceeds the
front.

**Measured result.** Same vertical, same bundle, after the fix:

```
before  sysmon.app load=120.206524624s read_bytes=591615  (first frame t=126.7s)
after   sysmon.app load=3.075388944s   read_bytes=591615  (first frame t=9.4s)
```

39x, on an identical byte count. The residual ~3 s over the 0.2 s unloaded
read is fair-share cost — eleven runnable tasks on four CPUs, each round trip
waiting out the running task's remaining slice — not starvation, and it is
the shape a proportional-share policy is supposed to produce.

**Regression test.** `a_woken_task_outranks_cpu_hogs_whatever_its_task_id`
runs the identical workload twice, varying only whether the sleeper is
spawned before or after the hogs, and requires it to be dispatched next in
both. Before the fix the spawned-after case failed with `Ran(1)` where
`Ran(11)` was required; the spawn order was the control that isolated the id
as the cause.

**Scope.** CFQ only, which is the default and what production runs. The
EEVDF sibling admits at zero lag and orders by deadline, so a woken task's
deadline is genuinely earlier and no tie-break decides; MLFQ re-enters a
waker at high priority. Two *separate* EEVDF defects noticed while
confirming that are recorded as D74 and D75.

---

## D74 — EEVDF charged every dispatch a fixed service quantum regardless of how long it ran (FIXED)

Every run advances the CPU's fair clock by the ticks it used, measured on the
bracket the per-task CPU time already used, and a run that requeues is also
charged them; one that parks is not, since a woken task rejoins with zero lag.
A charged run's `ve` advances by that service over the task's weight
(the shared `share::vslice`), the deadline moves on a whole request only once
`ve` reaches it — a task that ran short keeps its deadline, since the rest of
its request is still owed — and `V` advances by the same service over the
*time-shared* weight on the CPU, with the sub-unit remainder carried to the
next run. A request is one quantum of the port's own tick, which the port now
states (`SchedulerArch::quantum_ticks`, D290). Real-time service neither
advances `V` nor dilutes its rate.

`equal_weights_share_time_not_dispatches` (a long runner got 1600 ticks to a
short runner's 200 under the fixed charge; now within one request),
`a_short_run_keeps_its_deadline_until_the_request_is_served` and
`a_realtime_run_leaves_the_fair_clock_alone` (`kernel/sched/eevdf`), each
failing against the fixed charge.

---

## D75 — EEVDF's ready set was a `Vec` scanned linearly on the dispatch path (FIXED)

The ready set is two binary heaps, *pending* by eligible time and *eligible*
by deadline. `V` never moves backwards, so an entry is promoted at most once
per enqueue and a pick is `O(log n)` amortised; when nothing is eligible the
earliest-eligible entry runs and `V` fast-forwards to it. No entry is removed
from the middle — a stale one is discarded when picked — so a heap is all the
set needs, and both heaps keep room for every entry, reserved fallibly on
push, so a promotion never allocates (D291). Ties break on arrival order, not
the drawn task id. `every_pick_matches_the_earliest_eligible_deadline_scan`
model-checks the heaps against the linear scan they replaced over 20 000 random
pushes, picks and clock advances.

---

## D76 — the device manager parked for the rest of the boot waiting for a hardware-tree bump that nothing emits, so nothing autoloaded (FIXED)

**Root cause.** `tairix_devmgr::service::react_once` fetches the driver-store
catalogue and, when the store endpoint is not yet served, fails soft and
leaves `catalogue = None` — logging `13005 DRIVER_STORE_UNAVAILABLE`. Its own
rustdoc then claimed the retry was driven by the kernel: *"the kernel then
bumps the tree generation when it binds, waking this loop to retry"*. **No
such bump exists.** Every `hw_tree_wake()` call site in the tree is a
hardware-*tree* mutation in `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/hwtree_store.rs`
(attach / detach / fault-health); the driver store endpoint appearing is a
kernel boot milestone with no generation bump behind it and no wake source
exposed to userland.

So the loop called `wait_for_change(last_generation)` — which passed
`u64::MAX` unconditionally — and parked. On a platform whose tree is
enumerated once at boot and never changes again (QEMU `virt` and any fixed
board: a device tree, no hotplug) **no further mutation ever arrives**, so
the device manager slept for the rest of the boot holding no catalogue and
autoloaded nothing. The kernel side was never at fault: `hw_tree_wait`'s
already-advanced fast path and its register-before-park ordering are both
correct, so no wake was lost — none was ever sent.

**Why this is load-dependent and bimodal.** The race is between the device
manager's first pass and the store endpoint being served. Win it and the
fetch succeeds and everything binds in ~8.7 s; lose it and the service parks
for ever. There is no middle, which is exactly the bimodality recorded
against a 480–720 s ceiling and which nothing that merely made the guest
slower could produce. riscv64 dominated the failures because its TCG guests
are the slowest and so lose the race most often.

**The evidence, from the run-2 transcripts.** `13005` is emitted at `Warn`,
so it survives a default-`Info` boot and separates the two outcomes cleanly:

| vertical | run-2 | `13005` | `13001` bound |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rtc-goldfish-qemu-riscv64` | UNFINISHED | 1 | **0** |
| `netstack-autoload-qemu-riscv64` | UNFINISHED | 1 | **0** |
| `netstack-static-qemu-riscv64` | passed | 1 | 1 |
| `autoload-input-qemu-riscv64` | passed | 0 | 1 |
| `rtc-pl031-qemu-aarch64` | passed | 0 | 1 |

Both failing rows lost the race and bound nothing. `netstack-static` lost it
too and still bound, because a *later* tree mutation happened to arrive and
rescue it — which is why membership varied per run while the tree stayed
byte-identical, and why no amount of bisecting could find this.

It also explains the one row that never varied. **`rtc-goldfish` is the
constant member because its vertical has nothing to rescue it**: the RTC is
its only device, so once the pass is missed there is no subsequent mutation,
ever. Its `id=23015` ("no real-time clock answered within the start-up
window") is not a third mechanism at all — it is the downstream symptom of
the RTC driver never being loaded.

**The fix.** The wait is indefinite only while nothing is outstanding. While
the catalogue is unfetched the loop waits under a bounded deadline
(`CATALOGUE_RETRY_NS`, 250 ms) and retries; once it is in hand the wait is
`u64::MAX` again, so the steady state takes no wakes and this is a bounded
wait for a milestone with no wake source, not a poll. `HwTreeService::
wait_for_change` grew the `timeout_ns` the caller chooses, and `Errno::
TimedOut` reads as "re-react" rather than propagating.

The deadline is deliberately keyed on the catalogue alone. Everything else
`react_once` defers — the `net.*` policy, the per-interface configs — is
woken by the node mutation it waits on, and keying the deadline on those
would poll for the life of a machine whose NIC or network stack legitimately
never appears.

**Why 661 host suites passed while the guest hung.** `ScriptedTree::
wait_for_change`, the double every loop test used, returned `Ok(())`
*unconditionally* — whether or not the generation had advanced. The double
was strictly more forgiving than the kernel, which parks. A loop test could
therefore never observe the hang.

**Regression cover.** `tairix_devmgr::service` gains `StaticTree`, a double
that models the kernel's parking semantics instead of a scripted sequence: a
finite deadline elapses `TimedOut`, and an unbounded wait on a generation
that can never advance reports `WouldBlock` so a host test observes the park
a guest would suffer. Two tests, both verified failing before the fix
(`WouldBlock`) and passing after:

- `a_deferred_catalogue_is_retried_on_a_tree_that_never_changes` — a store
  refusing its first fetch on a tree that never changes still binds the node.
- `the_wait_is_bounded_only_while_the_catalogue_is_outstanding` — the
  deadlines are `[CATALOGUE_RETRY_NS, u64::MAX]`, so the bound applies only
  while the fetch is outstanding.

**Ruled out earlier, with evidence, so they are not re-derived.**

- *Not degradation.* Both original quantitative legs were withdrawn: `silent
  at kill` reproduces per-*ceiling* (two unrelated verticals both 179.45 s),
  so it measures the harness; and `stalled_ms` is the sampler's own
  survivorship (the soft-lockup threshold is 10 s and a passing riscv64
  vertical completes in ~8.7 s, so only guests that lived long enough carry
  any record). Every stall also *cleared*. Do not reinstate the "≥50×
  degradation" claim from either column.
- *Not riscv64 being broadly slow.* Every riscv64 vertical that completes
  takes the same time either side of the D93 fix, to within ~1%.
- *Not a lost reschedule-IPI wake.* Real, fixed under D93, and not this: in
  the park window `sstatus.SIE` is clear and a single-hart guest is its own
  only IPI source.
- *Not a gratuitous self-IPI.* The Arch-HAL contract requires a self-`send_ipi`
  to still reach the preemption entry point ("a no-op equivalent to setting a
  self-reschedule flag"), so raising `SSIP` on your own hart implements it and
  eliding it would drop a requested reschedule.
- *Not the login respawn loop.* riscv64 installs `NULL_CONSOLE_READ`, so fd 0
  answers `NotFound`, `login` fails at `stage=username` and `init`'s
  `SESSION_SPAWN_BUDGET = 3` bounds the relaunch — correct fail-loud
  behaviour, not a spin.
- *Not the absolute ceiling.* Raising it is the mitigation D22 records as
  exactly what let its own defect hide.

**What this does not cover: see D95.** In some runs the netstack rows failed
a genuinely different way — the guest *provably completed* (`id=7001`,
`id=4180`, `id=16009`/`id=13010`, and five echoes served at `id=16012`) and
only the host-side peer observer's confirmation never arrived. That is a
harness defect this fix cannot touch, and it is tracked separately.


## D78 — the file manager's icon cache could not hold one frame of its own grid, and an evicted icon was never decoded again (FIXED)

Reported as "the files.app icons on `/System/Commands` frequently show the
default pixmap instead of the app's own, especially while scrolling". Two
defects, either of which alone was enough.

- **The budget was ~3× short of a single frame.** `working_set_ui_cache`
  ceilinged at `CacheBudget::from_backing` — a *sixteenth* of the output — while
  documenting itself as holding what can be visible at once. Measured on the
  file manager's own default 480×480 window: sixteen 42-pixel grid tiles need
  117 KiB where the ceiling was 57 KiB, and the shortfall is scale-invariant
  (the tile grid and the ceiling both scale with area). The ceiling is now one
  screenful (`CacheBudget::from_ceiling`), which is the honest bound — icons are
  drawn *on* the output, so no more of them can be visible at once than fill it.
  Only a quarter of it is the pressure-proof working set (`WORKING_SET_DIVISOR`,
  twice the measured need): declaring the whole screenful irreducible until
  severe would pin megabytes the session is not drawing on precisely the machine
  that is tightening.
- **An evicted answer was answered "not yet" for ever.** `ArtworkDesk` marked a
  collected key *answered* and only forgot it at a round boundary the embedder
  opened on input. So a second repaint within one round — which any tier walk on
  the rail or toolbar provokes — found the evicted key still "answered", drew the
  built-in glyph, recorded no decode, and the window sat wrong until unrelated
  input arrived. Measured: 16 of 16 tiles correct on the first repaint, 5 of 16
  on the next. A collected answer is now *forgotten* — the cache owns it, so a
  later miss is genuine and is produced again — and the self-renewing refusal the
  round rule also guarded is left to `ArtworkResolver::declined`, which was
  already the precise instrument for it. The round concept and `begin_round` are
  gone from both embedders.

**Regression cover:** `lib/reclaim` (a frame's icons fit the working-set ceiling
and do not fit the cursor fraction), `lib/icon` (a key the cache dropped is
decoded again; a refusal reported after the collect that forgot the key is still
recorded; a refusal in flight leaves the decode to land), and
`userland/apps/files` (a whole window's grid, over the real renderer at the real
window size, keeps every tile's artwork across repeated repaints and a scroll,
and re-decodes nothing).

---

## D81 — a block split invalidated one page instead of the block's whole range, so a stale coarse TLB entry faulted unrelated addresses (FIXED)

**This was the Pi 4 boot wedge D13 chased**, and the fatal-fault reporting D13
closed is what made it legible. The mechanism was proved from metal and the fix
confirmed there: it reproduced in roughly 1 boot in 20 and has not recurred in
over 40 boots.

### The mechanism

`unmap_single_page` tears down a kthread kernel-stack guard page on a **live**
root. To reach a 4 KiB leaf it calls `split_block`, which refines the covering
2 MiB block (and, the first time in a gigapage, the 1 GiB block) into a table
of finer entries — then flushed **one page**, the guard page it came for.

Refining a block changes the *granule* every address that block covered
translates at. A TLB holding a coarse entry for any of those other addresses
now conflicts with the finer walk, and the architecture permits it to fault
that walk. So the maintenance owed was the whole former block's range on every
PE; the code invalidated one 4 KiB page of it, leaving every other address in
the block able to take a spurious level-2 translation fault against tables that
plainly mapped it.

The kernel heap shares low identity-mapped RAM with those guard pages, which is
why the victim was heap metadata: the faulting PCs resolve to
`tairix_kalloc::Inner::push_free` and `tairix_kalloc::Block::has`.

### The evidence that fixed it

`id=4011 fatal kernel fault cpu=1 syndrome=0x96000046 fault_addr=0x02ca1a88
fault_pc=0x2ce15c root=0x4540000 fault_maps=no fault_par=0x080d
fault_hole=block maps_after_tlbi=yes par_after_tlbi=0x02ca1a88
desc_0=0x4541003 desc_1=0x0040000002c00701 peers_stopped=2 peers_asked=3`

- `DFSC=0b000110` — translation fault at **level 2**, i.e. the 2 MiB granule.
- **`maps_after_tlbi=yes`** — discarding the cached translations makes the same
  address translate, tables untouched. That is what convicted TLB maintenance
  rather than the tables, and no combination of the older fields could.
- `desc_1` is a **valid** 2 MiB block for the enclosing region, every time.
- **The address varied across captures** — `0x3e402000`, `0x02a7cb38`,
  `0x02ca1a88` — always inside gigapage 0, always a block `desc_1` maps. A
  varying victim is the signature of a granule conflict: it refuses whatever
  the core happens to touch, not a particular address.

Three explanations were killed by reading the port rather than by inference,
and are recorded so they are not re-derived:

- **Not cache visibility.** `TCR_VALUE` sets `IRGN0`/`ORGN0` to write-back
  read/write-allocate and `SH0` to inner-shareable, so table walks are
  cacheable and coherent with the data caches.
- **Not ASID aliasing.** The entries are global (`desc_1` bit 11 clear), but
  `activate_user_root` already issues `tlbi vmalle1` on every root change.
- **Not a dirty secondary TLB.** `adopt_boot_translation` →
  `program_stage1_translation` issues `tlbi vmalle1`, so a secondary starts
  clean; the conflicting entry is latched *after* it is online, by a runtime
  split.

### The fix

`split_block` reports whether a granule actually changed and, when it did,
issues one `tlbi vmalle1is` — the whole regime, on every PE — instead of
leaving the caller's per-page flush to cover a block-sized change. An
already-fine hierarchy changes no granule and pays no invalidation.
`refine_to_page` carries that decision so it is host-testable
(`refining_a_block_reports_the_granule_change_that_owes_tlb_maintenance`,
`refining_a_fresh_2mib_block_reports_a_granule_change`); the invalidation
instruction itself has no off-target effect.

**The fix originally landed on aarch64 only, and that was a defect in its
own right** (§2.21: a fix left in one arch's file for its identical twin to
be re-derived later). x86_64 and riscv64 carried the same missing
maintenance — the same stale coarse entry, the same varying victim — and
the same false "break-before-make-free" claim in their docs. Both now share
the shape: `refine_to_page` reports the granule change and `split_block`
pays it, with one whole-address-space local invalidation per port (a `CR3`
reload on x86_64, whose leaves are never `GLOBAL`; a whole-hart
`sfence.vma` on riscv64). Intel SDM Vol 3A §4.10.4.1 is explicit that
software changing a linear address's page size must invalidate before the
address is used again, so this was never merely theoretical on x86_64.
The split surface is since deleted with D82 — kthread stacks no longer live
in the identity map, so nothing refines a live translation and the
maintenance this fix added has no remaining caller.

The false claims that hid this — `split_block`'s own "break-before-make-free
for the running region", `prepare_guard_arena`'s, `unmap_single_page`'s "so
disturbs no live address", and the `docs/src/platform/aarch64.md` copy — are
corrected in place.

**Residual exposure, closed by D82:** the few instructions between publishing
the table and completing the invalidation were still a break-before-make
violation. Moving kthread stacks into the shared kernel remap window removed
the refinement — and the surface — entirely.

### Landed alongside, from the same investigation

- **The report stops the world before it reads anything about the machine**
  (`kernel/core/src/panic.rs`). Both the probe and the descriptor walk were
  previously taken while peers ran, so they could describe two different
  states — and did, which cost a diagnosis. Regression test:
  `the_translation_readings_are_taken_after_the_stop`.
- **The post-flush re-probe** (`maps_after_tlbi` / `par_after_tlbi`), a closed
  Arch-HAL slice (`translation_after_tlb_flush`) with its own conformance
  vertical: a port that cannot probe cannot report a verdict. This is the
  reading that decided the defect.
- **The console proves the scan-out reachable before painting it.**
  `attach_console` walks every 4 KiB page of the surface with the non-faulting
  probe and refuses the console if any page does not translate, so the UART
  keeps it and `video_console` reports the refusal. `apply_surface` re-proves
  it, because that is the path a fatal report takes to reclaim the screen. The
  `// SAFETY:` claim that the surface is "identity-mapped RAM" was false and is
  now earned. (Unrelated to the fault above, which is why the first capture's
  framebuffer address was a red herring.)
- **`split_block` orders a child table's fill ahead of the descriptor that
  publishes it** on aarch64 and riscv64; x86_64 needs none under TSO and says
  so, rather than leaving the asymmetry to look like an oversight.

### Not the defect

`configure_identity_typing` passes `(fb_base, fb_len)` to
`gigapage_mask_from_extents`, which is a **per-gigapage** mask, so on this
board it only re-marks gigapage 0 — already set by the kernel's own extent.
That makes the call redundant *here*, not wrong: on a board whose scan-out
lies outside the kernel's gigapage it is the only thing that maps it, and the
extents are merged into one mask rather than replacing each other. A second,
finer-grained mapping path would add machinery with no case where it helps.

**Remaining, tracked elsewhere:** a QEMU vertical that repaints the framebuffer
console post-MMU is still owed, so a scan-out the active root does not cover
would be caught in the matrix rather than on metal — the console now refuses
such a surface, so this proves the refusal rather than the fault.

## D82 — refining a live translation was a break-before-make violation; kthread stacks moved off the identity map (FIXED)

**The defect.** Two paths refined a block on a root that was **already the
active translation regime**: `boot.rs` called `prepare_guard_arena` after
`enable_mmu_and_vectors`, and at runtime `unmap_single_page` split the block
covering a kthread guard page. Replacing a valid block leaf with a table is a
block-size change on a live translation — identical output address and
permissions, different granule — and a TLB holding both granules for one
address is CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE.

D81 was the consequence of that violation going *unmaintained*. Its fix
(invalidate the whole regime whenever a granule changed) bounded the exposure
to the few instructions between publishing the table descriptor and completing
the invalidation, but did not remove it.

### Why the obvious repairs do not work

Recorded so they are not re-derived:

- **Break-before-make on the 2 MiB block.** The break window leaves the range
  unmapped, and the range holds *other kthreads' stacks* — a peer CPU may be
  executing on one, translating through this very root. Not available.
- **Refine the whole arena in each root at construction.** Covers the blocks
  that exist when the root is built; a block the arena chained *later* (drawn
  from the frame allocator at an arbitrary physical address) is coarse in
  every already-live root, so the live refinement returns.
- **Share the identity gigapages' L2 tables across roots.** A chained block
  can be in any gigapage of the identity window, so this means sharing all
  512 — giving up gigapage TLB coverage for the whole kernel. A real
  performance regression for a rare event.

### The fix: kthread stacks do not live in the identity map

A guard page that is **never mapped** needs no refinement, no unmap and no
maintenance. Each kthread kernel stack is now a run of pages in the shared
kernel remap window (`kernel/mem::KernelVirtMap`, whose sub-hierarchy every
root installs), laid out `[guard slot | usable run]` with the guard slot
reserved and never mapped. The guard is therefore absent in *every* root at
once rather than per-root, and nothing refines a live translation.

The tier is architecture-neutral (`kernel/core::kstack`), so the three ports'
duplicate `alloc_kernel_stack` bodies are gone with it and
`ArchImageBuilder::alloc_kernel_stack` / `ImageBuildCtx::kernel_stack_guard`
are deleted: a build owes the child's root nothing. `kstack::alloc_kernel_stack`
is the one allocation path — PID 1's stack, `thread_create`'s, a deferred
load's — and falls back to the software-canary `BoxStack` when no window
exists, never to an unguarded stack.

Deleted with it (§2.14): `split_block`, `refine_to_page`,
`prepare_guard_arena` and the `BlockSplit` declaration on all three ports and
in the HAL (plus its conformance vertical and host tests);
`VirtualMemory::unmap_single_page`; `LiveUserSpace::unmap_kernel_stack_guard`;
the physical guard-arena carve in `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/mem_map.rs` and
the `MemoryLayout` pairing it existed for; `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/
stack_arena.rs` and its tests; and the four QEMU verticals that existed only
to prove the split (`stack_guard_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}`,
`stack_arena_qemu_aarch64`). `BLOCK_2MIB` and `guard_arena_pool_capacity`
lost their last consumers and went too; the aarch64 boot page-table pool is
now one frame, since the identity map is all it builds.

### The three decisions the design owed

- **The serialiser.** `KernelRemap::space` is now an `IrqSafeSpinLock`
  parameterised on the port's `PortIrqControl`. It masks because one of its
  consumers is the kernel heap, which an interrupt handler may allocate from:
  a handler firing on a CPU that holds the lock and then growing the heap
  would spin for a lock its own interrupted mainline holds. That is a property
  of the lock, not of an audited caller list, so it holds for a consumer added
  later. The stack tier's own `slots` stays a plain `SpinLock`: it is reached
  only from thread admission and from the drop of an admitted task's control
  block, both in task or dispatcher context. Lock order is slots-then-map on
  both the heap and the stack path, so the two can never be taken in opposing
  order. The stale "the only caller already holds the global heap lock" claim
  on `space` is replaced rather than left standing — a claim of exactly that
  kind is what hid D81.
- **The window split.** Decided at the one site that installs both consumers
  (`kernel/core::init`, Phase Mem), as a policy over discovered geometry
  (§24.1): every stack page is frame-backed, so the tier can never usefully
  hold more pages than the machine has usable RAM, and it takes exactly that,
  capped at half the window so the heap keeps a guaranteed share on a machine
  whose RAM rivals the window. Below the cap the tier cannot exhaust address
  space before the frame allocator is out of memory, so its fail-closed path
  is a genuine OOM rather than an invented ceiling. The heap takes the low
  remainder and the tier the top, so the two can never hand out the same
  address.
- **Zeroing.** Neither `FrameAllocator::free`/`free_order` nor
  `FrameHeapSource::fill` nor `KernelVirtMap::map_chunk` zeroes, so the tier
  owes it: a freed stack is scrubbed through `lib/pagezero` while it is still
  mapped, before `unmap_run` hands its frames back (§4 zero-on-free — a kernel
  stack can hold spilled capability tokens).

Reclaiming a freed stack drives `KernelVirtMap::unmap_run`, which makes stack
teardown a second production initiator of the x86_64 cross-CPU shootdown. That
was gated on D52, whose contract used to require a masked initiator to be the
only one in flight; the protocol now owes the acknowledge itself and asks
callers for nothing.

`FrameHeapSource::fill`/`drain` were hoisted rather than copied: both
consumers share `kernel/mem::back_run` (the order-step-down assembly that
keeps growth working on a fragmented pool) and `release_run`.

### riscv64's remote fence — fixed

`publish_mappings` reasoned that "the scheduler never runs one space on two
harts at once, so no remote fence is owed". True for a process space, false
for the kernel remap window and the boot root, which are active on every
hart — and Sv39 permits caching *invalid* entries, so a hart that already
walked an absent leaf keeps faulting on it until it is fenced, however
correct the tables become.

An address space cannot know which CPUs share it, so the reach is declared
per port and performed by the consumer that holds the cross-CPU handle:
`CrossCpuTlbShootdown::publish_needs_remote` (default `false` — aarch64 and
x86_64 never cache an absent entry and keep paying nothing), overridden
`true` on riscv64, and `KernelRemap::map_chunk` follows the local publish
with a `shootdown_range` over exactly the installed run when the port
declares it. Host-tested both ways in `kernel/mem/src/kvmap.rs`. The riscv64
QEMU verticals are single-hart, so the matrix still cannot observe the
multi-hart effect.

**Proof.** The split policy is host-tested in `kernel/core::kstack` (RAM-bound
and cap-bound ends, and that the two shares tile the window). The fault form
is proven on all three ports by the rewritten
`stack_overrun_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}`: each draws a stack through the
production `kstack::alloc_kernel_stack`, **checks the run came from the
window** — a silent degrade to `BoxStack` fails the test rather than passing
it, the D69 shape — checks the usable run is writable, admits a kthread on it
through `spawn_kthread_with_stack`, and observes the synchronous fault its
overrun into the unmapped guard slot raises. The x86_64 vertical boots the
whole production pipeline, so its window check also proves the *production*
install rather than the test's own.

---

## D83 — on x86_64 only a page fault reaches the fatal-fault report; every other kernel-mode exception still dies mutely (FIXED)

Noticed while closing D13's first defect (the production kernel now installs a
fatal-fault handler on every port, so a kernel-mode exception reaches
`kernel_core::fault_dump` and states its syndrome / faulting address /
faulting instruction). aarch64 and riscv64 fan **every** unhandled exception
into one tail (`exceptions::fatal_exception` / `trap::fatal_exception`), so
that install covers all of them. x86_64 does not: `percpu::init` fills every
IDT slot with the one fail-closed default thunk, and only vector 14 (`#PF`)
is later replaced with a dedicated, error-code-aware entry that consults the
installed handler. So a kernel-mode `#GP`, `#UD`, `#DF`, `#SS`, alignment
check, or machine check reached the vector-agnostic default thunk, whose
whole body was `qemu_exit::exit_failure()` — a write to QEMU's `isa-debug-exit` port
followed by `halt_forever()`. On real hardware that port write does nothing,
so the machine parks with no diagnosis at all: exactly the mute-death defect
D13 named, surviving on one port for one class of exception.

Two problems compose:

- **No per-vector stub, so no syndrome to report.** The default thunk is
  vector-agnostic by construction (it pushes `SavedRegs` and calls one Rust
  function), so it cannot say *which* exception fired or read the
  error code the CPU pushed for the subset of vectors that push one. Routing it
  to `fault_dump` today would mean fabricating `syndrome`/`fault_addr`, which
  the record must never do. The honest fix is what the arch crate's own module
  doc already stages: extend `define_isr!` to emit vector-specific stubs
  (vector number, and error code where the vector pushes one), then point every
  exception vector at them and reach the installed handler exactly as the
  `#PF` entry does.
- **A test-harness affordance sits in a production fatal path.** The default
  thunk's `qemu_exit::exit_failure()` writes port `0xf4` on a production
  kernel. It must park through the port's ordinary halt, with the report
  written first.

### The fix

`kernel/arch/x86_64/src/exceptions.rs` gives every architecturally-defined
vector (`0..=31`, less the resumable `#PF`) its own stub: the vector as an
immediate, the CPU-pushed hardware error code where there is one and a
synthetic zero where there is not, the faulting `rip`, and the saved `CS` so
the record can say which ring it came from. `define_exception_isr!` emits
them (the exception counterpart of `define_isr!`, whose stubs resume through
`iretq` and so cannot carry an error code); one `exception_vectors!` table
declares each vector once and generates both the stubs and the install list,
with a `const` assertion that no entry strays outside the exception range or
claims vector 14. All of them funnel into `fatal_exception`, which reaches
the installed `FaultHandlerFn` — the same fatal policy the other ports'
single exception tail reaches — and parks if the slot is empty.

x86_64 has no cause register, so the vector *is* the cause: it is packed
with the error code and the privilege verdict into the neutral syndrome word
(`fault::exception_syndrome`, decoded by `syndrome_vector` /
`syndrome_error_code` / `syndrome_from_user`). The error code occupies the
low 32 bits deliberately, so `is_not_present` / `is_user` / `is_write`
remain valid decoders of a `#PF` syndrome and every existing `#PF` consumer
reads the same bits; `#PF` now reports through the same packing, so there is
one syndrome spelling. The faulting-address field is `0` for every vector
but `#PF`: none of them supplies one, and `CR2` would name whichever page
fault happened *last* — a fabricated field is worse than an absent one.

`install_vector` now derives a gate's IST index from the same
`percpu::ist_for_vector` mapping `percpu::init` used, so overwriting `#DF`
or `#NMI` keeps its dedicated stack instead of silently defeating the swap;
the "must not overwrite vectors 2 or 8" caveat is deleted with the footgun.
The default thunk keeps only vectors `32..=255` and parks through the port's
ordinary halt — `reset::park_cpu`, now the single definition every
parked-CPU path shares — instead of writing QEMU's debug-exit port.

Proven by `tests/integration/kernel_exception_qemu_x86_64`: it boots the
**production** pipeline (the stubs are installed there, in `bring_up_bsp`),
claims the fatal slot ahead of `boot`, executes `ud2` on `BootCompleted`,
and asserts the report decodes to vector 6 with no error code, the
kernel-mode verdict, no faulting address and a non-zero `rip` — a check a
vector-agnostic thunk could not satisfy. The `AuditEvent::KernelFault`
record itself is the shared `kernel_core::fault_dump` path the other ports
already exercise.

### Residue, recorded not buried

- **A ring-3 exception other than `#PF` ended the machine.** The stub
  reported the ring-3 origin honestly in the syndrome rather than claiming
  a kernel fault, but there was no terminator to route it to. Closed as
  D86, which added the slot and made the chargeable-vector set a declared
  column of this module's own table.
- **A delivery at an uninstalled vector `>= 32` parks without a record**,
  because one shared thunk serves them all and cannot name its vector. That
  includes the LAPIC spurious vector (`0xFF`), which is not an error at all
  and should not be fatal. D85.

## D91 — a leader thread that exits first stranded its process id, which the draw could then reissue (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** A process *is* its leader thread's `TaskId`
(`plans/THREADS.md` decision 1), so `ProcessId(N)` and the leader's
scheduler task share the number `N`. When the *leader* called
`thread_exit` while a sibling was still live, `threads::retire` dropped
only the leader's alias: `land_thread_down` returned `false`, no process
teardown ran, and `CapTable::entries[ProcessId(N)]` stayed live under the
surviving sibling. The scheduler, meanwhile, reaped the leader's task on
the next dispatch and removed `N` from its registry — so
`choose_task_id`'s liveness predicate stopped seeing `N` and could draw it
for a new process. That process was admitted at `ProcessId::leader(N)`,
where `CapTable::insert` *overwrites* the entry (adopting the old record's
I/O counters and adding the newcomer to the surviving sibling's member
set): two unrelated processes sharing one capability record.

**Fix — the zombie leader, as one shared rule rather than a policy
operation.** The id is held against the *draw* while the identity outlives
the task that carried it. `kernel/sched/api` owns a process-wide reserved
set beside the generator it already owns, and `choose_task_id` composes it
with the policy's own liveness predicate (`is_live(id) || reserved(id)`),
so every policy inherits the rule through the one call each already makes.
`threads::retire` owns **both** halves, because it is the per-thread
half of every death and so is the one place the group's member count
crosses: it holds the number when a retiring thread is its process's
leader and siblings remain, and returns it when the count reaches zero.
Releasing from the process teardown instead needed a second call site —
the driver-store unload tears a driver down inline rather than through
`reclaim_process_bookkeeping`, so it would have held a number for the
rest of the boot — and a third teardown path would have forgotten again.

Two designs were rejected, and are recorded so they are not re-derived:

- **A new `SchedulerPolicy` operation** (what this entry originally
  proposed) would need three implementations plus conformance, and the
  reservation is not a scheduling decision — it is the id rule, which
  already has one home.
- **Holding the leader as a zombie inside each policy's `tasks` map** is
  Linux's literal shape but wrong here: `live_task_count() == 0` is what
  ends the boot CPU's dispatch loop, so a zombie in `tasks` would keep it
  dispatching forever after the last real task exited, and would also be
  visible to `step`, work-stealing, and the placement scan in all three
  policies.

Reserving in `retire` rather than in `land_thread_down` is deliberate:
`retire` is the per-thread half of *every* death, so the driver-store
unload path (`init.rs`) is covered by the same definition.

**Regression cover:** `kernel/core` —
`a_leader_retiring_before_its_siblings_holds_its_id_against_the_draw`
covers the whole lifecycle (the id is refused to an admission while held,
and admissible again once the last sibling retires, so a hold cannot leak
pid space for the boot), and `a_sibling_retiring_holds_no_id` pins the
hold as the leader's alone. Each half of the fix, removed independently,
fails the first test.

## D92 — `fd_grant` named its recipient by pid alone, so a delegation could land on a later holder of that number (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `fd_grant(fd, pid, write_ceiling)` minted a one-shot file
delegation keyed by `ProcessId(pid)`. The grantor learned that pid from a
kernel-attested source (`call_peer_origin`) at some earlier point. If the
requester exited in between and a new process drew its id,
`registry.contains(recipient)` was satisfied by the *newcomer* and the
delegation was minted to it; the newcomer could redeem a descriptor the user
picked for someone else. The check and the mint were already atomic against
each other; the window was between *learning* the pid and *granting*.

**Fix: the recipient is named by its attested `ProcId`, and the pid leaves
the ABI entirely.** `fd_grant(fd, write_ceiling, recipient, recipient_len)`
takes a user pointer to the 16-byte instance the grantor read from an
`Origin`. The kernel resolves it through the new `CapTable::process_of_instance`
— the inverse of `instance_of` — to the number its per-process tables are
keyed by, records the instance with the delegation
(`PendingFdDelegation.recipient`), and `fd_redeem` admits that instance
alone. There is no longer a number in the request that can go stale.

**The enforcement point is redemption, not the mint, and that is the whole
point.** A check at the mint cannot be made atomic without nesting
`caps.read()` inside `aspaces.write()`, and that order is the reverse of the
one `introspect_source::processes` already takes (`caps.read()` held across
`aspaces.read()`); with `lib/sync`'s **writer-preference** `RwLock` a pending
writer blocks new readers, so the pair is an ABBA deadlock. Enforcing at
redemption needs no atomicity argument at all: the redeemer's instance is
`caller.caps.proc_id()`, the dispatcher's own capability snapshot, so it
costs no lock and cannot change under the check. A mint that raced its
recipient's exit is therefore *inert* in a newcomer's hands rather than
merely unlikely.

**Two failure shapes fail closed at the mint as well**, so the grantor gets
an honest immediate answer instead of a handle that would never redeem (the
picker delivers `PickCancelled` rather than `FilePicked`): an instance no
live record holds, and the `ProcId::KERNEL` sentinel. The sentinel guard is
load-bearing rather than tidiness — every kernel thread reads as it, so
sixteen caller-supplied zero bytes would otherwise resolve to whichever
record was scanned first.

**Why the in-flight-call option was rejected: the picker holds no call
open.** `shm_grant` and `call_grant` resolve their recipient as an
endpoint's live server, which is why neither has this window, and naming the
peer of an in-flight call (endpoint + ticket) would have kept the 16-byte
identity off the ABI. confd does qualify — its `fd_grant` sits strictly
between `call_recv` and `call_reply`. The picker does **not**: `PickFile` is
answered with only an *acceptance* (`status_call` returns at once), the pick
concludes when the **user** chooses an arbitrary time later, and the outcome
travels as a `FilePicked` event on the app's *event* endpoint. At mint time
the app is parked on its ordinary event wait, not blocked in `ipc_call`, so
there is no ticket to name. Do not re-derive this.

**What the fix deleted.** The session's `pid_of` lookup is gone from the
picker's delegation tail: the owner the compositor records *is* the attested
`ProcId`, so the grant names it directly, and `route_outcome`/`conclude_pick`
no longer thread `RtWindowIdentity` at all. confd threads
`origin.proc_id()` in place of `origin.pid()` through `Storage::grant`,
`bulk::mint`, `BlobStore::grant`, and `TempStore::create`.

**Regression cover** (each verified failing with its half of the fix
removed): `aspace::a_delegation_is_redeemable_only_by_the_instance_it_names`
and `syscalls::fd_redeem_is_owner_bound_and_one_shot` (a newcomer holding
the recorded *number* is refused, and the refusal consumes nothing, so the
chosen instance can still redeem) fail without the redemption filter;
`captable::process_of_instance_inverts_the_mint_and_refuses_the_sentinel`
fails without the sentinel guard — it seeds a table that genuinely holds a
`ProcId::KERNEL` record, which the handler-level assertion could not, since
the captable is empty at that point in its setup.

## D93 — riscv64 production never enabled its reschedule-IPI source, so a delivered IPI could neither wake the idle park nor ever be acknowledged (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `arm_preemption` installed the U-mode-preemption and
per-tick callbacks and enabled `sie.STIE`, but never installed an IPI
callback and never called `preempt::enable_ipi()` — the aarch64 boot path
does both, for the boot CPU and every secondary. So `sie.SSIE` stayed
clear, and `RiscvArch::send_ipi` (the SBI IPI the scheduler uses to say
"work landed on this CPU") raised `sip.SSIP` on a hart that had neither
enabled the source nor installed a handler. Two consequences:

- **`wfi` does not resume on it.** The privileged spec resumes `wfi` for
  *locally* enabled interrupts "regardless of the global interrupt enable"
  — `sstatus.SIE` is what it ignores, `sie.<bit>` is not. So the dispatch
  loop's documented park/wake contract ("any later IPI remains pending
  while masked and wakes `KernelArch::wait_for_interrupt`") was false on
  riscv64.
- **`sip.SSIP` latched for the boot.** `on_software_interrupt` is the only
  thing that clears it and it never ran, leaving an unacknowledged pending
  interrupt in the hart's register for the life of the boot.

The fatal-report peer stop (`kernel/core/src/panic.rs`) and the pre-boot
Supervisor takeover's quiesce handshake both complete only through
`on_software_interrupt`, so both were inert on riscv64 — a fail-open the
moment a second hart exists.

**Why it was latent rather than observed.** The production riscv64 image is
single-hart, and inside the park window `sstatus.SIE` is clear, so no
handler runs and the parked hart is the only IPI source — nothing can raise
`SSIP` there. The QEMU verticals that exercise the IPI path
(`ipi_smp_qemu_riscv64`, `sched_drive_qemu_riscv64`) call `enable_ipi`
*themselves* in their test kernels, which is precisely what hid the
production omission. This is the shape the charter warns about: the fix
existed on aarch64 and its riscv64 twin was never written.

**Fix.** The three trap callbacks and the one step that installs them are
hoisted into `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/riscv64_preempt_wiring.rs` —
host-buildable for the same reason `riscv64_plic_irq` is — and
`arm_preemption` calls `install_callbacks()` then `enable_ipi()` before
`init_local_preempt`. Installing every callback in one step is what makes a
forgotten source a compile error at the call site rather than a silent lost
wakeup.

**Regression cover:** a host test that the wiring step installs all three
callbacks (`the_wiring_step_installs_the_preempt_tick_and_ipi_callbacks`);
it fails with the IPI install removed.

## D94 — the `fd_grant`/`fd_redeem` picker delegation had no guest vertical, and a plan and a doc both claimed it did (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM9-b recorded that the aarch64
`autoload_input` vertical "latches two new guest PASS witnesses —
`SyscallInvoked sc=fd_grant` then `sc=fd_redeem`", and
`docs/src/desktop/apps.md` stated the hand-off was "proven end to end". Neither
was true: `sc=fd_grant` appeared in no `.rs` file, and `qemu_tests.rs` carried
no `fd_grant`, `fd_redeem`, viewer or file-picker witness at all. The claim
asserted guest coverage of a *security* path — a capability-bearing descriptor
delegation between two principals — so a reviewer reading either document would
conclude the click-through was verified against a running kernel when only host
unit tests and the model covered it.

**Two of the entry's own sizing facts were also wrong**, and correcting them
made the work smaller than recorded:

- "No vertical's image fixtures carry the Viewer bundle" was false. The Viewer
  is a complete bundle (`AppInfo.toml`, `Run`, `Help/`, its icon) and the image
  build *discovers* it from the userland walk, so every fixture image already
  plants it; its manifest declares `kind = "application"` and
  `library = "Accessories"`, so it is already a row in the program-library
  popup. No new `FsDisk` variant and no fixture change were needed.
- "The user-authority session cannot `log_emit`" was false. The session already
  emits `DESKTOP_REVEALED`, `WINDOW_SHOWN`, `MENU_SHOWN` and `CONTENT_RELEASED`
  through `tairix_rt::LogSink`, and those records reach the serial transcript —
  the icon-bar vertical gates on `WINDOW_SHOWN` by its message text. Measured on
  a real run: `id=20003` and `id=20006` both appear.

**The recorded gate was unsound, so the fix does not use it.** FM9-b proposed a
test-kernel marker derived from "the session's *first* `comm=desktop sc=fs_open`
after the FM9-a rename". Measured against a transcript, the session emits **43**
`comm=desktop sc=fs_open` records per run and **10** of them land *after* a
library launch, so "the first one after the launch" is not the picker's. The
picker's listing is also read on a worker (`Listing::Pending`), so no single
`fs_open` marks "ready to click" at all. Gating on a count of them is the
cumulative-event anti-pattern D19/D20 names.

**Fix.** The session announces the fact itself, exactly as it already does for
the sibling surface no channel reports:

- `tairix_desktop_session::PICKER_SHOWN` (id `20_008`, "file picker on screen"),
  emitted one-shot per pick from `present()` beside `WINDOW_SHOWN` and
  `MENU_SHOWN` — and only once `Browser::is_listing()` is false, so a picker
  showing its "listing…" cue with no row in it is not announced as usable. The
  picker is constructed before the first present so one announcement path serves
  every present.
- `PICKER_TOOLBAR` is public, for the same reason `PICKER_ORIGIN` already was: a
  host observer reconstructs a row's rectangle through the shared renderer and
  must lay out over the band the picker actually draws.

**The vertical: `tests/integration/filepick_qemu_aarch64` (new).** Its own
dedicated vertical rather than a stage on `autoload_input`, which is the D15
freeze case — landing a security path's only guest coverage on a
known-intermittent host would make it intermittent by construction. It boots the
production aarch64 pipeline against the shared autoload root, launches `view`
from the program library, waits for `PICKER_SHOWN`, and clicks the planted
document's row. The row's screen point is reconstructed by driving the
production `Browser` and `render::entry_rect` over the home listing, with both
sides deriving that listing from the same two definitions the fixture plants
from (`tairix_users::HOME_SUBDIRS` and `HOME_DOC_NAME`), so neither carries a
copy of it; the picker is undecorated session chrome, so the offset is
`PICKER_ORIGIN` alone with no client inset.

The guest PASS is a `SyscallInvoked` `sc=fd_grant` from `comm=desktop` followed
by `sc=fd_redeem` from `comm=view`, in that order. The planted document is text,
which a picture viewer states it cannot draw — the run's claim is which
principal delegated to which, and a refusal reads it as well as a render. Attributing each half to
the principal the kernel says made the call is what makes the run a statement
about a hand-off *between* processes; requiring the order rules out a redemption
that could not have come from this pick.

**Evidence.** The run's transcript carries the picked application loaded, then
`id=20008 file picker on screen`, then `comm=desktop … sc=fd_grant`, then
`comm=<app> … sc=fd_redeem`, and the two `proc` ids differ with the app's
`pproc` naming the session — so the delegation crossed a real process boundary.
The recorded run named `viewer`, the app the vertical was written against; it
is now `view` and the transcript's shape is unchanged.
Falsified by removing the pick-click: the run then fails at its ceiling with
`view` launched and the picker on screen but **zero** grant or redeem records,
so the witness is caused by the gesture and not by the launch. Four consecutive
runs pass in 16.88–17.09 s.

The `PICKER_SHOWN` guard is host-tested three ways (announced once, only after
the listing lands, silent with no pick showing, announced afresh for a later
pick); removing the pending guard makes the "waits for its listing" test fail on
exactly the wrong behaviour.

**Landed alongside, from the same investigation.** The library-row lookup was
copy-pasted in **four** scripts (the icon-bar, hover, autoload and new
picker paths), one of them with its own `"terminal.app"` literal bypassing
`BUNDLE_SUFFIX`. All four now share `library_row_centre` + `bundle_path`, and
the headless-shell construction they each repeated is `reconstructed_shell`.
The three pre-existing verticals pass unchanged after the fold.

## D95 — an unbounded transmit parked the netstack link peer inside its send path, so its completion gate never tripped and the run blamed the guest (FIXED)

Split out of D76, whose root cause (the device manager parking with no
catalogue) is fixed and does **not** explain this half. Here the guest
*succeeded*: the transcripts carry the driver loaded (`id=7001`), its channel
published (`id=4180`), the interface bound (`id=16009`/`id=13010`) and inbound
echo requests served with replies queued (`id=16012`). The run still died on
its absolute ceiling, because what the harness waits for is the host-side peer
observer's confirmation and that never arrived.

**Mechanism, measured.** `bind_wire` set only a *read* timeout on each peer
wire's datagram socket, so its transmit was unbounded. A Unix-datagram
counterpart that stops draining saturates after **93 × 1514-byte frames**
(measured on this host), and the next `send_to` on a socket with no write
timeout then **blocks indefinitely** (measured: still blocked at 5 s, versus
~50 ms once bounded). A QEMU descheduled on a loaded host is exactly such a
counterpart. The peer thread therefore parked *inside* `send_frames`, and from
there it could never reach `socket.recv` — so it never saw the guest's echo
reply, never confirmed, and the gate it owns stayed at `Watching` for the whole
remaining ceiling. The transcript signature is diagnostic: a handful of
`id=16012` records and then silence, because the peer had stopped campaigning
as well as stopped listening.

That is why the guest looked guilty. The guest for a gated vertical is built
not to self-exit, so it never falls silent and the inactivity heartbeat can
never fire; the absolute ceiling was the only backstop, and it reports "the
guest was still alive and never completed".

**Second defect, the one that hid the first.** The peer's verdict was folded
into the result **only on `Outcome::Pass`**. On a `Timeout` or a
`RuntimeCeilingExceeded` it was collected — so the thread was never left
unjoined — and then dropped, so the report named the ceiling and never
mentioned that the observer had stopped watching. A dead or parked observer was
indistinguishable from a slow guest, which is what sent the investigation to
the guest side for two ledger entries.

**Fix, both halves, with no ceiling touched.**

- `bind_wire` now bounds the transmit as well as the receive (`SEND_TIMEOUT`,
  one receive slice), so a saturated wire *drops* the frame the way a real NIC
  drops from a full transmit ring — which is what that path's own docs already
  claimed happened. It is the one binding path every peer role shares, so no
  role can be left with an unbounded transmit.
- The completion gate can now represent failure. `tairix_qemu::ObserverGate`
  carries an `Observation` of `Watching` / `Confirmed` / `Abandoned(reason)`
  instead of a bare `AtomicBool`; `NetPeer::launch` — now the single place a
  peer thread is started, so the bond role cannot diverge from the rest —
  records an `Err` verdict as `Abandoned`, and the runner ends the run at once
  with `DoneReason::ObserverAbandoned`, carrying the observer's own reason on
  the same channel a drain or injection failure uses. A confirmation already
  reached is never overwritten by a later abandonment.
- `fold_peer_verdict` folds the peer's verdict into **every** outcome, so a
  failed run names both its own reason and the observer's.

**Regression tests, each demonstrated failing first.**
`a_saturated_wire_drops_the_frame_instead_of_parking_the_observer` saturates a
real counterpart and times the next hand-over on a worker thread: it fails at
its 30 s bound with the transmit bound removed and passes in 0.10 s with it, so
the failure is a failure rather than a hung test.
`a_failed_run_reports_its_link_peers_verdict_too` fails with the old
consult-only-on-pass semantics restored, reporting exactly the misleading
ceiling-only message that hid this defect. `gate_decision` is split out of the
poll loop so the abandonment branch — the one that only fires when something
has already gone wrong — is assertable without a QEMU boot.

**Not claimed.** The starved-host failure is not reproduced end to end here:
doing that means running the netstack verticals under deliberate host
oversubscription, and the mechanism above is established by direct measurement
of the socket behaviour plus the transcript signature rather than by a
reproduction. What is now true is that the parking path no longer exists, and
that an observer which stops watching for *any* reason ends its run
immediately with its own reason instead of expiring on a ceiling that blames
the guest.

## D96 — three ports each hand-wrote the per-tick body, so wasm32 drove no timed-wake sweep at all (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** A blocking wait carrying a finite deadline (`hw_tree_wait`,
and the console/IPC waits on the same path) is released by
`tairix_kernel_core::timed_wake_sweep`, which the port must run from its
timer tick. Nothing shared expressed that: each port wrote its own
`extern "C" fn(CpuId)` tick body and installed it, and all three
bare-metal bodies were the same three calls — `note_preempt_tick`,
`timed_wake_sweep`, `check_stall`. A fourth port inherited none of it, so
wasm32 drove no sweep, and the omission was invisible because there was no
single definition to be missing from. The identical `preempt_current`
wrapper was triplicated the same way and the IPI latch duplicated twice
more; two QEMU test kernels carried verbatim copies of both.

**Fix.** `kernel/core/src/traps.rs` is now the one definition of all three:
`on_user_preempt_point`, `on_timer_tick`, `on_reschedule_ipi`. Every port
installs *those* — there is no per-port tick body left in which a duty can
be omitted, so a new port gets the sweep by construction. The eight
duplicated definitions are deleted.

Each port's install is a wiring module gated `#[cfg(any(kernel_isa = …,
test))]` — `{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}_preempt_wiring` — carrying a host test
that pins the *shared* callback in each slot by function-pointer identity.
A port that reverts to its own body fails that test. This is the pattern
`riscv64_preempt_wiring` already used for the lost reschedule IPI (D93),
extended to the other two ports.

Two blockers were fixed on the way, both real defects in their own right:

- `kernel/arch/{aarch64,riscv64}` both exported an unmangled
  `SECONDARY_STACK_BASE` to their secondary-boot trampolines, so any build
  linking both harts' ports failed to link. Both are now port-qualified via
  `#[export_name]`, matching the `tairix_arch_<arch>_*` convention the same
  files already use for their exported *functions*.
- x86_64's tick/preempt callback slots were `cfg`-gated to `target_os =
  "none"`, so on the host they silently stored nothing and read back `None`
  — the sibling ports' slots are host-live. The gating is removed (eight
  `cfg` forks deleted) and the two tests that asserted the host inertness
  are now round-trip tests. `timer_hal`'s host cell stays: it isolates the
  conformance vertical from the `preempt` slot, exactly as aarch64's does.

**What is not claimed.** No wasm32 image runs `kernel/core` at all — the
port has no production kernel binary and its two browser verticals drive
`kernel/sched` directly — so no finite-timeout wait exists there to fire
yet, and none is demonstrated. What is now true is that the port has
nothing left to get wrong: its frame loop already dispatches through
`Timer::dispatch_tick` (host-tested by
`preempt_tests::animation_frame_drives_the_tick_callback_and_counts`), and
the body it will dispatch is the shared one. A wasm32 `kernel/core` boot is
port bring-up tracked in `plans/WIRING.md`, not a missing sweep.

## D97 — a userland service's log threshold cannot be lowered on a shipped system, and four documents said it could (OPEN)

**Mechanism.** `lib/log`'s level filter is process-local and defaults to
`Info`. The kernel's comes from `BootInfo::log_level`, which each port's
boot entry passes as a compile-time constant (production: `Level::Info`).
Nothing plumbs a level to a *userland* service: every `set_max_level` call
under `userland/` is inside `#[cfg(test)]`, and `lib/sysconfig` carries only
`net.*` keys. A service therefore drops its own `Debug` records in O(1)
*before* the `log_emit` syscall, so raising the kernel's level cannot reveal
them either.

**Consequence.** The device manager's routine diagnostics — `13002`
`NODE_UNBOUND`, `13006` `TREE_OBSERVED`, `13007` `NODE_OBSERVED` — are
unreachable on any shipped boot. They are deliberately `Debug` (one `Info`
line per unbound node once delayed a Pi's passphrase prompt by tens of
seconds by starving the keyboard pump), which is right; what is missing is
the other half of that trade, a way to ask for them when diagnosing a
machine that bound nothing. §18.4 requires an unbound node to be logged, and
it is — into a filter that no operator can open.

**Corrected in the change that found this** (the same shape as D94's false
coverage claim, so not cosmetic): `docs/src/drivers/hardware-detection.md`,
`userland/system/devmgr/README.md`, `devmgr/src/events.rs` and
`devmgr/src/autoload.rs` each told the reader to "lower the level"/"lower the
threshold"/"when diagnostics are enabled", inviting an operator to use a
mechanism that does not exist. They now state what is actually available.

**Not fixed here, and why.** The mechanism is a design with a security
dimension, not a line: who may raise a service's verbosity, whether it is a
boot-config key or a runtime request, and how it stays clear of the
hash-chained audit log (§19.4) that must *not* be filterable. Escalated
rather than guessed.

**Done when:** a shipped system can raise a named service's log threshold
under an explicit authority, the setting is observable, and the device
manager's unbound/observed records are demonstrably reachable on a real boot
without a rebuild.

## D85 — an unexpected interrupt at an uninstalled x86_64 vector parks with no record, and a spurious LAPIC interrupt is treated as fatal (OPEN)

Noticed while closing D83. Vectors `0..=31` now each carry a stub that names
themselves and reaches the fatal report; vectors `32..=255` still share the
one vector-agnostic thunk `percpu::init` installed
(`interrupts::tairix_arch_x86_64_isr_default`). It parks the CPU fail-closed,
but it cannot say *which* vector fired, so the park carries no diagnosis.
That is the same mute-death shape D83 closed for exceptions, surviving for
the interrupt range.

Worse, one of those vectors is not an error at all. The boot path programs
the LAPIC's spurious-interrupt vector to `0xFF`
(`lapic.software_enable(0xFF)` in `x86_64/boot.rs`). A spurious interrupt is
a normal, expected hardware event — it needs no end-of-interrupt and must
simply return — yet it lands on the fail-closed thunk and ends the machine.
Nothing has been observed hitting it, but "the machine dies if the LAPIC
delivers a spurious interrupt" is not a defensible steady state.

**The fix.** Emit a stub per vector for `32..=255` as well, so every
delivery names its own vector: `Idt::with_default_handler` becomes a
per-vector populator over the generated table (the IST index already comes
from the shared `percpu::ist_for_vector`), and the vector-agnostic thunk is
deleted because nothing points at it.
The spurious vector gets a dedicated non-fatal entry that returns through
`iretq` without an EOI, per Intel SDM Vol 3A §11.9.

**Done when:** every IDT vector carries a stub that names it; an unexpected
interrupt is reported with its vector before the CPU parks; the LAPIC
spurious vector returns instead of parking; the vector-agnostic thunk is
gone; and a QEMU vertical drives a delivery at an
uninstalled vector and observes the record.

## D88 — an EL0 fixture's `rxe` was not rebuilt when a dependency of its program changed — FIXED

**Root cause: 43 fixtures each hand-kept the list of sources their nested
build depended on.** Every vertical that spawns a separately-linked EL0
program compiles it through a nested `cargo` in its own `build.rs`, and each
declared `cargo:rerun-if-changed` on the *program crate's own* files only —
`src/main.rs`, its `Cargo.toml`, and the linker script. A change to a crate
the program **depends on** (`lib/rt`, `lib/abi`, `lib/abi-trap`) matched none
of those, so the build script did not rerun, the nested build was not
re-driven, and the vertical ran the previously converted blob. The failure
mode is the dangerous one — the vertical *passes*, against code that has left
the tree — and it stayed hidden because a clean tree (the CI runners, and the
documented `cargo clean` before a gate) builds every blob fresh.

**Fix: one recipe, and the closure comes from the compiler.**
`program_fixture::GuestBuild` is the single nested cross-compile every such
fixture now drives. A vertical names the package, the `pie::PieArch`, the
constants it pins into the guest through the environment, and — where one
package is built twice — the variant, which needs its own target directory
because one directory holds one artefact per package. It returns the converted
`rxe` (`program_rxe`) or the position-independent archive a C object links
against (`static_archive`). The ~60 lines each fixture carried are gone, and
with them the last copies of the target triple: a fixture names
`PieArch::Aarch64`, never `"aarch64-unknown-none"`.

Freshness is derived, not enumerated. `dep_info::emit_dep_info_reruns` reads
the dep-info rustc wrote beside the artefact and registers every source the
compilation read — the whole dependency closure — plus each source's owning
`Cargo.toml` (rustc records the files it *read*, so a manifest edit would
otherwise be invisible) and the workspace lockfile. Prerequisites inside the
private target directory are dropped: they are that build's outputs, the
recipe may wipe them, and cargo reruns a build script forever once a
registered path is missing.

**The two inputs cargo cannot see are stamped rather than wiped away.** The
old per-fixture recipe wiped its private target directory on *every*
build-script run, which was only cheap because the script almost never reran
— the defect itself. With the closure wired, an unconditional wipe would turn
any `lib/rt` edit into 43 clean `-Z build-std` rebuilds, so
`pie::wipe_target_dir_on_stamp_change` records a stamp beside the directory
and wipes only when it moves. The stamp holds the linker script's *content*
(`RUSTFLAGS` carries only its path) and the pinned environment (cargo tracks
that only where the guest crate itself declared
`cargo:rerun-if-env-changed`), length-framed so two different sets cannot
render the same bytes; an unreadable input yields no stamp and forces the
rebuild. The guard is shared with the image pipeline's `Run`-binary builds,
which carried a second copy of it.

**Regression cover.**
`no_fixture_build_script_enumerates_its_guest_inputs_by_hand` scans every
`tests/integration/*/build.rs` and fails on any non-comment line naming a
guest's `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, or `Cargo.toml`; it listed all 86
offending lines before the fix. Beside it: the closure computation (a
transitive dependency's source and manifest and the lockfile in, the build's
own outputs out), the stamp's framing and its fail-safe on an unreadable
script, the per-variant target directory, the dep-info name for both artefact
shapes, and the wipe guard's keep/wipe/fail-safe decisions. Confirmed end to
end on the aarch64 heap and preempt-EL0 verticals: an `ARENA_BASE` edit in
`lib/rt` changes the embedded blob, and so do a pinned `SPINS` constant and a
`program.ld` base-address change, each returning to the original bytes when
reverted — the second and third rebuilds incremental, not clean.

## D86 — on x86_64 a ring-3 exception other than a page fault killed the machine instead of the task — FIXED

**Root cause: the port had no user-fault terminator slot at all.** aarch64
and riscv64 route a lower-privilege unhandled exception to an installed
`fault::user_fault_terminator`, which records the crash exit, reclaims the
task, and suspends it with an exit action so the CPU carries on. x86_64 had
no such slot: its `#PF` entry folded the kill into the `UserFaultResolveFn`,
whose signature is page-fault-shaped (`(faulting_addr, write, regs)`), so it
could not serve `#UD`, `#GP`, `#AC` or any other vector. A ring-3 `ud2`
therefore reached the same fatal report a kernel fault does and ended the
machine — an unprivileged denial of service from any process. D83's
per-vector stubs made the record *honest* about the ring-3 origin but had
nothing to route to.

**Fix.** `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/fault.rs` gains the set-once
`UserFaultTerminateFn` slot in the aarch64/riscv64 shape, and
`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/x86_64/dispatch.rs` the
`production_user_fault_terminate` callback over the already-shared
arch-neutral `dispatch_core::terminate_user_fault_via_slot` — no second
copy of the terminate sequence. `bring_up_bsp` installs it beside the
resolver, refusing the boot on a second occupant
(`BootError::UserFaultTerminatorInstall`), so the slot is filled before
user space exists.

**Which vectors may be charged to a task is now a declared per-vector
fact.** "Any ring-3 exception" would have been wrong twice over, so
`exceptions::Origin` is a third column of the one `exception_vectors!`
table, beside each vector's stub name and error-code shape — a vector is
written once with all its facts and they cannot drift:

- `Origin::Task` is a fault or trap the executing instruction itself
  raised (Intel SDM Vol 3A Table 6-1). A ring-3 delivery is the running
  task's own and kills only that task.
- `Origin::Machine` covers `#NMI` (an external interrupt, not an
  exception), `#DF` (an abort whose saved state the SDM calls unreliable),
  `#MC` (an imprecise machine-level abort), vector 9 (unused since the
  i386), and the reserved vectors. None is the interrupted task's doing, so
  charging one to a task would be a fabrication. **`#NMI` and `#DF` are
  also the two `percpu::ist_for_vector` routes to a shared per-CPU IST
  stack** — the terminator reschedules, and abandoning that stack
  mid-suspension would corrupt the next delivery on it, so the
  classification is load-bearing beyond honesty. A vector the module does
  not own resolves to `Machine` (fail closed).

**The stub had to carry two more operands.** A crash record needs the
faulting register frame, so `exception_isr_body!` now also marshals
`&SavedRegs` and the interrupted `rsp` — read before the `andq $-16, %rsp`
alignment, which rounds *down* and so cannot disturb the GPR block above
it. Long mode pushes `SS:RSP` for every delivery, so the slot is the
interrupted stack pointer whichever ring it came from.

**One GS bracket, not two.** Both callbacks are now invoked through
`fault::with_ring3_context`, which performs the `swapgs` pair an interrupt
gate taken from ring 3 does not (a callback may reschedule, which needs the
kernel GS base) and builds the register frame. The `#PF` entry's open-coded
bracket is gone, so the convention has one definition.

**Regression cover.** `tests/integration/wild_fault_qemu_x86_64` boots the
production bring-up and drives three faulting children through production
spawn + wait: `ud` executes `ud2` (vector 6, no error code), `gp` executes
`hlt` (vector 13, *with* an error code — the other stub shape), and `jump`
covers D42. Each must be reaped at exit 139, and the parent reaping a third
child is the proof that none of the first two took the CPU with it. It also
claims the fatal slot, so a regression names the vector and the ring rather
than wedging the run; confirmed to fail without the fix
(`vector=6 from_user=true error_code=0`), and confirmed for the error-code
shape by temporarily reclassifying vector 13 as `Machine`
(`vector=13 from_user=true error_code=0`, non-zero `rip`). Host-side:
the slot's set-once round-trip, the `Origin` table against the SDM, and
`no_ist_routed_vector_is_ever_charged_to_a_task`, which reads
`percpu::ist_for_vector` rather than a second copy of the vector numbers.

---

## D87 — an instruction-side fault kill is audited against the task's *data* mappings — FIXED

`record_fault_exit` took a bare faulting address, and
`DispatchHook::terminate_user_fault` handed it the offending **program
counter**. Everything downstream describes a *data* address's relationship
to the task's mappings — `fault_class` asks whether it is in stack growth
room, a file region or an anonymous region; `classify_fault_locality`
measures its distance from the stack reserve base or the nearest region
end — so a code address made the record fabricate one. The D42/D86
vertical showed it plainly: a wild jump, a `ud2` and a `hlt` all audited
`fault_class=wild fault_offset=below_stack_guard region_offset=~40400`,
i.e. "a stack overrun 40 KB below the guard", purely because a program's
text sits that far below its stack. The kill itself was always correct
(right exit status, resources reclaimed, backtrace from the real `pc`);
only the class/bucket/offset fields lied, in a security-relevant audit
record. Pre-existing on every port — aarch64 and riscv64 have had the
terminator since D39 — so x86_64 only made it visible.

**The fix.** The access kind is now carried in the type the fault path
threads, `aspace::FaultAccess`: `Data { va, write }` or `Instruction`,
which has no address at all. `classify_fault_locality` therefore *cannot*
be handed a program counter, and an instruction-side kill resolves to
`FaultLocality::NoDataAddress` (audit `fault_offset=no_data_address`, no
`region_offset`) with `fault_class=instruction` and `access=instruction` —
replacing the old `write` boolean, which could only call an
instruction-side kill a load. The crash-record vocabulary gained the
matching `CrashFaultClass::Instruction` / `CrashFaultBucket::NoDataAddress`
(`lib/abi/src/sysinfo.rs`), and the direction is now *derived* from the
class by `CrashRecord::access` rather than read off the store flag, so no
consumer can render an instruction-side kill as a read; `from_bytes`
refuses a wire record that pairs the instruction class with a data
locality or a store flag. All three ports route every instruction-side
exception through `terminate_user_fault` already — x86_64's
`is_user_data_fault` excludes the `#PF` I/D bit, and the aarch64 and
riscv64 resolvers only see load/store aborts — so each gets the honest
record from the one shared path with no per-port change.

Tests: `classify_fault_locality_places_an_instruction_kill_nowhere` and
`record_fault_exit_distinguishes_an_instruction_kill_from_a_data_access`
pin both sides against *identical* registry state, so the data kill's
`below_stack_guard`+distance is exactly the record the instruction-side
kill is proven not to get; `crash_record_instruction_side_carries_no_data_locality`
pins the ABI round-trip and the three fail-closed decodes. The D42/D86
vertical (`tests/integration/wild_fault_qemu_x86_64`) now grades every
`TaskFaultKilled` record its own children produce and PASSes only on three
honestly audited instruction-side kills — the exit status alone cannot
catch a record lying about the cause.

## D89 — sixteen QEMU verticals link an arch port with no allocator — FIXED

Sixteen verticals link an architecture port (`tairix-arch-x86_64` /
`-aarch64` / `-riscv64`) *without* linking `tairix-kernel`, and declare no
`#[global_allocator]`. They stopped building — `no global memory allocator
found but one is required` — the moment a port reached an allocating path,
which took the whole `test --qemu` stage down with them on every Tier-1
target.

The path was `lib/log`'s boot ring, which was heap-backed. It now builds on
`lib/inline`'s allocation-free `RingBuf`, so no port pulls an allocator in and
a freestanding binary that links one needs no heap of its own. `lib/log` names
`alloc` only inside its own test module.

That is the right shape rather than sixteen new `#[global_allocator]` blocks:
a vertical links a port precisely to prove an Arch HAL property *without* the
kernel, and roughly fourteen verticals already carry their own copy of that
block, so transcribing sixteen more would have been the duplication the
charter forbids.

Verified by building all sixteen on all three Tier-1 targets.
## D90 — the host test suite passed only in the harness's alphabetical order (DONE)

A test suite is a set, not a sequence, and this one had become a sequence:
several tests read process-global kernel state another test writes, so they
passed only for as long as the harness's default alphabetical start order
happened to put them the right way round. Four of them **hung** rather than
failed, and a hang has no budget above it.

Closed on two axes: the order dependence itself, and the gate blindness that
let it accumulate.

**The gate now randomises the order.** `cargo xtask test --shuffle` starts each
host pass in a fresh random order and puts the seed in the step's label;
`--shuffle-seed N` replays it. `ci` passes `--shuffle`, and `ci-long`'s flake
hunt gives each replica an order of its own, so ordering is hunted alongside
timing. An order-dependent suite now fails the change that introduces it
(`docs/src/contributing.md`).

**What the order dependence actually was**, in the shape the fixes took:

* **A boot publication one test decided for every other.** `WAIT_ARCH` is
  set-once per boot, but the unit-test binary runs many independent boots in
  one process, so whichever of `init`, `console`, and `blockwait` reached it
  first fixed what the rest saw — and `blockwait` then `expect`ed an install
  that had already happened. `waitq::wait_arch` now answers from a per-test
  claim (`kernel/core/src/test_boot.rs`; libtest runs each test on its own
  thread) and `install_wait_arch` publishes through a cell of its own under
  `cfg(test)`, the same treatment `cpu_state::install` already gave its
  table. A test that claims nothing sees no hook, exactly as before any boot
  publication.
* **State keyed by an id every test mints identically.** The signal kill gate,
  the wait-set registry, the call-endpoint registry and the watch registry are
  process-global and keyed by task id — and each test builds its own scheduler,
  every one of which mints `1`, `2`, `3`. So a termination one test
  legitimately deferred against *its* task 1 read as one against another's, and
  a `release_owned_by(7)` tore down a concurrently-running test's wait-set.
  `test_boot::claim_task` issues each test an id of its own, far above every id
  the suite spells by hand; the two default endpoint fixtures own their
  endpoints under it rather than under a shared `1`.
* **A container born poisoned for want of a boot publication.** `LaunchCache`
  keys its index under the per-boot hash key and starts poisoned without one,
  so the reclaim and cached-launch tests measured nothing unless a sibling had
  published first. The publication is now one shared helper every such test
  calls.
* **Two reads of a monotonic clock compared to each other.** The writeback
  host's clock gate asserted `now_ns() == wait_now_ns()`, which holds only
  while nothing advances between them. It now advances a clock of its own and
  checks the value.
* **A level-gated record another test's threshold could drop.** The
  `tairix_log` filter is one process-global atomic: the driver-store scan's
  `Info` record vanished whenever a sibling pinned the threshold below it, and
  a `sysinfod` query test observed a `Debug` record only because a sibling had
  widened the filter first. Both now hold the level they read.

**Two defects found on the way, fixed here.**

* **`OnceCell::get_or_try_init` stranded its `RUNNING` claim on an unwinding
  initialiser** (`lib/sync`), so every later caller spun on a state nothing
  would ever advance. That is what turned one failing `blockwait` test into
  three hangs. An unwind now poisons the cell like a returned `Err`.
* **A scoped server thread outlived its failing client.** The refresh-cycle
  soak's server waits for 4 160 calls; a client that panics part-way through
  never makes the rest, and `thread::scope` joins before it propagates, so the
  failure's own message was never printed and the run hung instead. The
  `CallServer` fixture releases its server on both the return and the unwind
  path, and the three sibling `ipc_call` tests use it too — a `thread::spawn`
  + `join` there left the server spinning on a core for the rest of the run
  whenever the client failed.

## D98 — the harness cannot order typed keys after a pointer click, so a rename click-through cannot be gated (OPEN)

Found while closing D94, in the attempt to give the FM9-a mutation
click-through its guest coverage. The **create** half landed as the
`fsmutate-qemu-aarch64` vertical (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM9); the
**rename** half is blocked here.

**Mechanism.** The QEMU runner advances two independent cursors: a
`pointer_script` of `PointerStep`s and a `typed_keys` list, each step gated on
its own serial marker and occurrence count. Nothing orders one against the
other. A rename click-through needs typing that happens *strictly after* the
click which opens the inline editor, and the only markers available to the
typed-key cursor are ones that fire at or before that click — so the typing
could be injected while the menu is still open, where the characters reach the
focused window as shortcuts instead. Gating it on the same marker as the click
is a race by construction, which the no-flaky-tests rule forbids outright.

**Why the obvious repairs do not work.**

- **`PointerAction` cannot carry a key.** Its variants are `Move`, `Press`,
  `Release`, `Click`, so a key cannot simply be scripted as one more ordered
  pointer step.
- **The typed-key model cannot express the keys anyway.** `qkeycode_for` maps
  *characters*, covering printable ASCII plus `ret`/`tab`/`spc` and the
  `\u{3}` ETX byte as `ctrl-c`. It has no spelling for `F9` or a ctrl-shift
  chord, and the existing `ctrl-c` only works because ETX is a real character.
  Encoding `F9` as some sentinel character would be exactly the hack the
  charter forbids.
- **The app announces nothing to gate on.** The inline rename editor opening
  produces no audit record and no session announcement; the app's menu-choice
  delivery and its repaint are both counted events on shared channels.

**The fix, when it is done.** Give the runner **one ordered script** whose
steps are either a pointer action or a typed key, so a key can be sequenced
after a click the way two clicks already are, and widen the key vocabulary from
characters to a typed-key vocabulary (characters plus named keys and chords) so
`F9` and `Ctrl+Shift+N` are expressible. That is a refactor of shared test
infrastructure touching every enrolment's `typed_keys`, which is why it is its
own piece of work rather than a step inside a vertical.

**What it unblocks.** FM9-a's rename half; FM9-a's *toolbar* gesture (a files
window opens with `Chrome::HIDDEN`, so the New Folder tool is only reachable
after `Ctrl+F9` reveals the band, or via `Ctrl+Shift+N`); FM9-c's delete
click-through; and any later click-through needing a function key. The
regression test requirement rides with it: each unblocked click-through lands
with its own guest witness.

## D99 — `lib/browse`'s `render::manager_tool_rect` has no caller outside its own tests (OPEN)

Found while closing D94. `manager_tool_rect` is a public `lib/browse` entry
point — the forward mirror of `manager_tool_at`, added for the FM9-a New Folder
click-through — and every one of its callers is a test in its own crate. A
public item with no present-day consumer is speculative surface.

**Why it is not simply deleted.** It is the surface FM9-a's toolbar gesture
needs, and that gesture is blocked on D98 rather than abandoned: a files window
opens with its toolbar band hidden, so nothing can click a tool until the
harness can express the key that reveals it. Deleting it now and re-deriving it
when D98 lands would be churn; keeping it silently is the defect. It is
recorded here so the choice is explicit and bounded.

**Resolution.** Whichever comes first: D98 lands and FM9-a's toolbar
click-through gives it its caller, or FM9-a's toolbar gesture is abandoned and
the helper goes with it (`§2.14` — the change that makes code obsolete deletes
it).

## D100 — the PIE load base was never recorded, so every user code address in a diagnostic was unplaceable (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `AddressSpaceRegistry::set_load_base` / `load_base` existed and
were reached only from tests: no production path recorded a process's
relocated load base. Both consumers degraded silently, because each expresses
a code address as an offset into the program's own binary and **omits** the
field when the base is unknown rather than emitting it absolute — the
`plans/FIX-WILD.md` crash record's `pc`, registers and backtrace, and the
`plans/FIX-STALLTRACE.md` stall report's `pc` and `bt`. Fail-closed, so
nothing leaked and nothing crashed; the two diagnostics were simply blind,
and a reader had no way to tell "no address to report" from "the address was
withheld".

**Evidence.** The stall-trace vertical's first run. Its transcript carried a
complete overrun record with everything except the two fields the facility
exists for, which is what named the gap:

```
id=4150 ... name=stalltrace budget_ms=250 elapsed_ms=501 blocked_ms=500
  calls=4 sampled=blocking blocked_in=waitset_wait blocked_in_ms=500
```

**Fix.** `tairix_kernel_mem::image_load_base` is the one definition of "the
lowest relocated segment address". The three arch image builders compute it
from the same image and bias their layout was derived with and carry it in
`BuiltImage`; `build_child_image` records it per process beside the stack
span. It answers `None` — and so fails the build through the same
`refuse_build` path the layout derivations use — when a segment's relocation
overflows, rather than recording a base it could not compute.

**Regression tests.** `image_load_base_is_the_lowest_relocated_segment` (the
base is the lowest segment, not the entry point and not the bias, biased and
unbiased) and `image_load_base_refuses_an_overflowing_relocation`, both in
`kernel/mem`; plus `tests/integration/stalltrace_qemu_aarch64`, which fails
the run with its own code when a report's `pc` is absent or not
load-relative, so the guest cannot regress to the blind state without saying
so.

**What is not claimed.** PID 1's load base is still unrecorded: `init` is
entered by the boot path before any ordinary admission, and its own producers
(`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/*/init_spawn.rs`) do not go through
`build_child_image`. `init` arms no frame budget, so the stall report is
unaffected; a *crash* record for PID 1 keeps omitting its addresses. That
remainder belongs to `plans/FIX-WILD.md`'s own plumbing rather than being
smuggled in here.

## D101 — the debug image's kernel diagnostics were never linted by any clippy pass (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `cargo xtask ci`'s clippy stages — the host pass and every
per-target product pass — all ran with default features, and the whole
debug-image diagnostics body is behind the `watchdog-diagnostics` feature. So
the lockup detail, the kernel-activity breadcrumb, the per-CPU lock-site
stack, and (as it was being written) the task-latency watchdog were code no
gate ever compiled under `-D warnings`. A lint regression reachable only in
the non-shippable `debug` image could not fail CI, which is the one image a
developer actually runs.

**Evidence.** Running the same clippy by hand with the feature on surfaced
two pre-existing findings immediately, in code untouched by the change that
found them.

**Fix.** `tools/xtask`'s target-clippy stage now lints the kernel stratum
twice per Tier-1 target: once as the shippable `installer` image builds it,
once with the debug image's feature on. The feature name is read from the
same place the image build spells it, so the pass and the image cannot
diverge. The two findings it surfaced are fixed rather than allowed
unexplained — `report_detail_to`'s length, with the justification that it is
the linear record builder its siblings are, and
`lock_diagnostics_current_cpu`'s `Option`, which its installed seam's type
dictates.

**What is not claimed.** This closes the *kernel* stratum only. The enrolled
QEMU guests under `tests/integration/` remain unlinted, which is the separate
known gap staged in `plans/CODEVERIFY.md`.

## D102 — a new syscall's `SyscallHandlers` default answered a value instead of refusing, so an unwired kernel was indistinguishable from an inert one (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `latency_watch` returns a *value* rather than a status: zero
means "this image armed no budget", which a caller reads back instead of
handling an error it could do nothing about. Its `SyscallHandlers` default
was written to answer that zero directly — so a kernel that never wired the
handler would have reported "armed nothing" exactly as a shippable image
whose facility is compiled out does, and the two states could not be told
apart. Every other handler in the trait defaults to
`Err(Errno::NotImplemented)` precisely so an unwired subsystem is detected;
this one defaulted fail-**open**.

It was also the C-ABI surface's gap in the same change: `lib/abi-sys` must
export one `tairix_sys_*` stub per `abi-v1` syscall, and the new syscall had
none — 119 stubs against 120 table entries — so a third-party program could
not call it at all.

**Evidence.** Two independent gate stages, on the same change:

```
tests::registry_covers_exactly_the_frozen_table
  every abi-v1 syscall must have exactly one tairix_sys_* stub
  left: 119   right: 120

dispatch_capability_gate_tracks_oracle
  minimal failing input: [Call { cap_mask: 0, selector: 119 }]
  left: 0   right: 1        (handler reached: no; oracle: yes)
```

The proptest model is what named the fail-open default: its oracle expects an
uncapped syscall to *reach a handler*, and the silently-succeeding default
satisfied the return value while reaching nothing.

**Fix.** The default refuses with `Err(Errno::NotImplemented)` like every
sibling, and `kernel/core`'s override — present in **both** feature states,
with only the answer differing — is what returns zero on an image that
compiles the facility out. The `lib/abi-sys` stub
(`tairix_sys_latency_watch`) and its registry row were added; the generated
C header already carried the prototype, since that is emitted from the
table.

**Regression tests.**
`an_unwired_handler_refuses_rather_than_answering_a_value` in
`kernel/syscall` drives a double implementing only the trait's *required*
methods, so every defaulted handler is exercised as an unwired build behaves;
`latency_watch_marshals_the_budget_and_returns_what_was_armed` and
`latency_watch_passes_zero_through_in_both_directions` in `lib/abi-sys`; plus
the existing registry-coverage and capability-gate model, which are what
caught it.

**What this says about the change that caused it.** Both halves were found by
the whole-project gate rather than by the per-crate runs used while building,
which is the reason the charter makes the whole-project run the only thing
that counts as done.

## D103 — the fork-join pool has no true-SMP vertical (OPEN)

`lib/parallel`'s `Pool` protocol is exercised dynamically only by
`threads-qemu-x86_64`'s `parallel` role: three real `lib/rt` threads, twelve
pieces, thirty-two rounds, plus a nested dispatch and one issued before the
workers can have reached their loop. That chassis brings up the BSP alone, so
the four threads time-share one CPU. The desktop verticals cannot stand in for
it: they run `cpus: 1`, so `Pool::for_cpus` asks for no worker, `bands` answers
one, and `compose_span` never dispatches at all.

Single-CPU time-sharing is a real exercise of the protocol — it is where the
dispatching thread routinely draws every piece before a worker is scheduled,
which is the case the claim word answers (D105) — but it cannot race that word.
Two participants compare-exchanging a draw against the dispatcher's own is a
genuinely concurrent interleaving that only two CPUs executing at once can
produce.

**What it would take.** No existing *user-program* chassis brings up
secondaries, so this is not the Cargo-alias reuse that
`mem-pin-migration-qemu-aarch64` is over `mem_pin_qemu_aarch64` (same
`src/main.rs`, different `cpus:`). It needs secondary bring-up added to a
user-program chassis — `threads_qemu_x86_64` already has the AP code available
(`tairix_arch_x86_64::smp`, as `scheduler-stress-qemu` drives it) but does not
use it — after which the vertical is a Cargo.toml alias at `cpus: 4` driving the
existing `parallel` role, with no fixture duplication.

**Why it is recorded rather than done.** The claim protocol's state machine is
proven exactly and deterministically host-side (`lib/parallel`'s `Claim` cases),
and the wake handshake is the same announce-then-recheck pairing every barrier
this pool has had used. The gap is a coverage gap, not a known defect.

## D104 — switchboard spent a frame in thousands of syscalls (FIXED)

A Pi 4B debug run reported the switchboard overrunning its 250 ms budget with
`calls=4220`, `calls=8536` and `calls=6624` — thousands of syscalls in one
frame span — alongside `blocked_in=ipc_call` at 447 ms and a 207 ms span whose
blocking was spread across calls rather than concentrated in one. This entry
recorded two hypotheses and named the instrument that would decide between
them; a later run on the same board settled it.

**Ruled out by reading the code.** `Sampler::read_paged` pages 64 records per
call and `walk_pages` stops on a short page, so no paged reading costs a call
per record; `SOCKET_RECORD_CAP`/`PROCESS_RECORD_CAP` of 4096 are 128 and 64
calls, not thousands. `pressure::refresh` reports only a band *movement*, and
`trim_glyph_cache` enforces the new ceiling rather than flushing, so a
flapping band does not empty the glyph cache and force a `FONT_ENDPOINT` round
trip per glyph.

**What the instrumented run answered.** `top_calls=mem_unmap=4254,ipc_call=13`
of `calls=4279` — the heap, and *not* the map/unmap pair this entry had
predicted. Fewer than twelve calls remain for everything else, so there were
essentially **no** `mem_map`s: not a high-water oscillating across a page
boundary but a monotonic descent, some 18 MiB of live heap going away in one
frame as a panel closed.

That distinction mattered, because the retention this entry called the fix
could not have addressed it. A retention is a **level**, and a level slides
down with the free span it bounds: once the free top exceeds it, every further
free of a page finds one more page above the line and hands back that single
page. Reproduced host-side at 3840 `mem_unmap` calls for a descending teardown
of a 4096-page arena — each one a page-table walk, a kernel zeroing pass, the
**global** `AddressSpaceRegistry` write lock and a TLB shootdown to every other
CPU. One process's teardown therefore serialised every other process's frame,
which is how it appeared in the same log as a desktop drag frame blocked for
992 ms (D105).

**Fixed** by giving the arena a resize granule as well as a retention
(`ARENA_RESIZE_BYTES`, `lib/rt/src/heap.rs`): a free top is released only once
at least a granule of it stands above the retention, and then all of it goes.
The same figure floors arena *growth*, which the run also showed costing a
`mem_map` per page for a run of page-sized allocations. The granule is
deliberately not derived from the machine, process or band — a proportional one
would hold 64 MiB of a gibibyte arena back from a machine already asking for it
— and the band keeps the last word, because the trim `pressure::report` drives
ignores the granule and releases everything above the retention in one call
(`AGENTS.md` §25, amended; rationale in `PLAN.md` "Charter Amendments").

The same teardown now costs 64 unmaps at every band, and its growth 116 maps
where the band permits a pad
(`a_bulk_teardown_resizes_the_arena_in_granules_not_a_page_at_a_time`).

That bounds the calls a **successful** teardown makes, and it is what the
granule can bound. The signature returned on a later Pi 4B run at ~3700
`mem_unmap`s per 250 ms frame, because those calls were being *refused* and
re-asked — a second, independent cause the count could not distinguish from
this one. It is D114.

## D105 — the pool's fork-join barrier waited on a worker that had registered before it knew whether any work was left (FIXED)

A Pi 4B debug run reported the desktop overrunning its 250 ms budget by
`elapsed_ms=1004 blocked_ms=992 calls=4 blocked_in=futex_wait`, resolving
through `WindowServer::serve` → `present_window_content` →
`winframe::decode` → `parallel::for_each` → `Pool::run` →
`Shared::await_holders`. A frame spent 992 ms of its 1004 in one park, waiting
for the fork-join pool.

**Why the previous fix did not close it.** `plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md`
recorded this signature as closed: the barrier had been narrowed from *every
worker* to every worker that had **joined** the dispatch, after the same report
at 429 ms. But a worker joined *before* it knew whether any piece was left —
"is there work for me" and "I am now reading this dispatch" were two words, so
the hold had to be registered first and the question asked afterwards. A worker
is woken by every dispatch, so it does reach a CPU, take its hold, and then
risk preemption with or without work, and the dispatcher waited for it either
way. The barrier was still over the scheduler's run queue rather than over the
work.

**Fixed** by making the draw and the hold the same atomic (`Claim`,
`lib/parallel/src/pool.rs`): one word carries the pieces left to hand out and
the workers still reading, so a worker becomes a holder *by* taking a piece,
and a worker that finds the pieces exhausted touches nothing, holds nothing,
and is never waited for however long it is descheduled. What remains waited for
is a piece genuinely in flight, whose result the dispatch needs anyway.

The separate `CLOSED` flag went with it — no pieces left *is* closed — so an
idle pool, a drained dispatch and a spurious wake are one state. Indices are
handed out descending, because the count must live in the same word as the hold
(a second atomic holding it would let a worker pair one dispatch's count with a
later dispatch's word and draw an out-of-range index); `JobRunner` already
contracts that the order is unobservable and `Reversed` holds consumers to it.
The dispatcher now also wakes only as many workers as there are pieces besides
its own.

**Coverage.** The state machine is proven host-side, including the case this
was about — a dispatcher that drew every piece itself has no holder to wait for
(`a_dispatch_the_dispatcher_drew_has_nothing_to_wait_for`). Racing the word on
two CPUs at once remains the open coverage gap D103, which the rewrite does not
change.

## D114 — `mem_unmap` refused every release a shrinking heap arena asked for, so the switchboard spent whole frames re-asking (FIXED)

A Pi 4B debug run reported the switchboard overrunning its 250 ms budget for
minutes on end with the frame spent almost entirely in syscalls:
`top_calls=mem_unmap=3670,ipc_call=16` of `calls=3701`, `blocked_ms=16`,
`sampled=running` — the D104 signature, on a build that already had the resize
granule. A granule that had cut a teardown to 64 calls could not be producing
3700, so the calls were not the ones it bounds.

**Cause.** `mem_unmap` demanded that `(base, len)` name a region the caller had
reserved **exactly** (`anon_region_exact` against the per-`mem_map` records),
and a shrinking arena never names one. The `lib/rt` heap grows one contiguous
arena by `mem_map(FIXED)` at its current top, so the records are a run of
abutting extents, while what it releases is the free top above its retention —
a boundary that falls wherever the free bytes fell. Every such release answered
`NotFound`, which changed nothing: `mapped_end` stayed put, the free top stayed
above the granule, and the next `dealloc` found the same release still due and
asked again. One refused syscall per free, each taking the global
address-space registry's read lock, for as long as the panel kept allocating.
Reproduced host-side at **3799** refused calls for one descending teardown of a
4096-page arena — the field counts to within 3%.

Both halves are defects, and both are fixed.

**The ABI releases pages, not mappings.** `mem_unmap` now confirms every page
of the range is one the caller holds (`anon_region_holds` — containment) and
releases exactly those, splitting the holding where the range cuts through, so
the surviving pages stay recorded and a first touch of them is still a
legitimate fault. Containment is what preserves the whole security property the
exact match was there for: a range holding one page the caller does not hold is
refused whole, touching nothing, so a task still reaches only its own memory.
The registry's anonymous records became a `RangeSet` of *pages* rather than a
map of extents — nothing needed to know which call placed a page — which also
means a heap that grew its arena over ten thousand calls costs one entry.

Uniform across placements, so no program need know which window its base came
from: the producer's placement window gained the same page-range release
(`AnonWindowMap::release_pages`, containment-checked), and the live space's
anonymous unmap uses it. The file window keeps its whole-placement release,
which is the `file_unmap` ABI.

**A refused release is asked once per arena extent.** Nothing about the arena's
top changes when a release is refused, so there is no new question to ask; the
heap remembers the `mapped_end` it was refused at and asks again only once the
extent moves. The pages stay mapped and recorded free — allocatable, nothing
lost — so a kernel that will not take them costs one syscall, not one per free.

**Coverage.** `mem_unmap_releases_a_sub_range_of_the_pages_the_caller_holds`
drives the heap's own release shape through the handler (two abutting `FIXED`
mappings, a free top straddling them) and asserts the refusals either side:
a range past the arena, a range over a hole already released, another task's
range. It fails with `Err(NotFound)` against the exact-match rule.
`a_refused_release_is_not_asked_again_until_the_arena_moves` is the storm
itself: 1 attempt where the unguarded heap makes 3799.
`a_page_range_release_cuts_only_the_pages_it_names` and
`unmap_of_a_placed_range_releases_its_pages_and_no_others` cover the placement
window and the live space. `heap_qemu_aarch64` now fails the run if a release
the heap asked for was *refused*, not only if none arrived — a refusal is an
arena that silently never shrinks, and the fixture's own value checks cannot
see it.

**Coverage boundary.** That vertical routes `mem_unmap` to its own producer, so
the handler's containment rule is proven host-side rather than on hardware; no
vertical drives the `lib/rt` heap through the real `kernel/core` handler. The
full-image desktop boot is what exercises that path, which is where this defect
was found and not where it was caught.

## D115 — the memory composition read "unknown" under load, because it was built from a count of *mappings* rather than of RAM (FIXED)

**What it was.** The Switchboard memory pane's `COMPOSITION` block stated an
absence, intermittently and worst under load, where a reader most wants it.
The parts did not partition the RAM, so `CompositionBar::new` refused
construction and the pane rendered the refusal as "unknown".

**Where the over-count came from.** `KernelMemoryStats::user_resident_bytes`
was `Σ_processes AddressSpace::mapped_pages() * PAGE_SIZE` — a count of live
*mappings*, so a frame shared between two address spaces counted once per
space and a user driver's MMIO window counted although it is not RAM at all.
`Reclaimable` and `Compressed` overlapped the kernel heap besides. The pane
floored each part's share independently and closed the whole with
`1000 - Σ named`; once the over-count pushed `Σ named` past 1000 the shares no
longer summed to the whole. A big-RAM task quitting dropped the sum back under
it, which is why the block "sometimes started showing".

**The fix is at the source: the kernel accounts physical RAM by disjoint
class.** A frame is charged at allocation to exactly one `MemoryClass`
(`lib/abi/src/memory.rs`) and the frame's own bookkeeping byte remembers it, so
a free reads the charge back and no caller can mis-attribute one. Sharing then
costs nothing — a shared frame is allocated once, so it is charged once — and
an MMIO mapping draws no frame and is charged nothing. `usable == free + Σ
class` therefore holds by construction, and `FrameAllocator::snapshot` reads
the whole and its parts under **one** lock acquisition, so it holds of the
reported figures too (the producer previously took three separate locks, so the
whole and its parts came from different instants — the same class of
inconsistency).

The class rides the high nibble of the byte that already held the free-list
order in its low nibble; the two never coexist on one frame, so the accounting
costs no extra memory and no extra memory traffic, plus one `usize` add inside
the lock the allocator already holds. It is stamped on every frame of a block
rather than on its head, because the kernel window releases a multi-page region
one page at a time as its page tables give the frames back.

`user_resident_bytes` stays — `top` and `sysmon` read it and it honestly
answers a different question — with its rustdoc corrected to say it counts
mappings and is not a share of physical memory.

**Coverage.** `kernel/mem/src/frame.rs`: the partition holds across alloc,
free, split and merge; a free discharges the class its alloc charged; a
multi-frame block freed one frame at a time discharges every frame (the shape
that first broke the fix); an uncharged head is refused with nothing mutated;
the packed tag round-trips every order and class.
`tests/integration/memsoak_program` checks the invariant end-to-end from the
guest on every sample, so a live kernel whose books do not balance fails the
soak with its reason rather than being measured against.
`resource_report_tests` drives the exact over-count shape — a mapping count
three times the machine's RAM — and asserts the bar constructs; it fails
against the old derivation.

---

## D116 — a duplex storage or network trace tinted both directions alike, and the storage rail plotted only reads (FIXED)

**What it was.** `Chart::with_opposing` took a `PressureKind`, and both hero
call sites passed the device's *own* kind for both series, so reads and writes
(and receive and send) drew in one hue: the instrument said a rate had two
directions and nothing about which way the bytes went. The storage rail entry
plotted `primary_history` alone, so the sidebar never showed writes at all.
Two rail entries also borrowed hues that were not theirs: the Tasks entry
plotted its process count in `PressureKind::Cpu`, reading as a second CPU trace
beside the real one, and the Recovery entry plotted its stopped share in
`PressureKind::Thermal`.

**The fix.** A chart's trace is tinted by a `SignalRole` — the theme's complete
semantic-signal vocabulary — not by a resource pressure, because a *direction*
is not a resource under load. `PressureKind::signal_role()` keeps a
resource-identity chart one call. Five roles were added: `workload` and the two
direction pairs `disk_read`/`disk_write` and `net_receive`/`net_send`.

The switchboard's `Trace` type carries the tinting with the readings —
`Absent`, `Single { role, samples, full_scale }`, `Duplex { inbound, outbound,
into, out }` — so "opposing samples with no opposing role" is unrepresentable,
and `Trace::chart()` is the single definition of the colouring that both the
rail entry and the pane hero draw through. Storage and network therefore cannot
drift apart, and the storage rail now shows reads against writes while its
trailing reading stays `% full`. `RailTrace` was deleted: it carried the same
points-plus-ceiling a `Trace::Single` does.

**Coverage.** `chart_tests`: each role traces in its own colour, and a duplex
trace draws its two directions in different ones. `rail_tests`: a rail entry's
chart *is* its trace's own, and the two non-device subjects carry their own
signals. `resource_report_tests`: a storage device's trace is
`Duplex(DiskRead, DiskWrite)` and an interface's `Duplex(NetReceive, NetSend)`,
on both the rail entry and the hero. `model_tests`: the task and recovery
traces carry `Workload` and `Recovery`.


## D117 — a wait-queue test asserted a clear reading of process-global deferred-wake flags its siblings set (FIXED)

Caught by D90's shuffle gate. `waitq::the_frequency_queue_is_on_every_shared_path`
opened on `!has_pending_deferred_wake() || CPUFREQ_WAITQ.wake_is_pending()` — a
reading of *five* process-global flags, of which it owned one. Nothing consumes
a flag in the host binary (the drain needs an installed arch), so the first
`console::`, `fs::` or `syscalls::` test to push a byte, publish a write-back
deadline or move a pressure band left the gate permanently true, and the
assertion then failed for every order that ran one of them first
(`cargo xtask test --shuffle-seed 6557463789261338282` replays it). The same
test also registered on a global queue and ran `run_timed_sweep` at
`now = 9_001`, which deregisters any *sibling's* waiter whose deadline had
passed — so it could break tests as well as fail.

**The duplication underneath it.** The property the test guarded — a named
queue is only useful if every shared path names it — needed a test only because
each set was hand-enumerated twice: `drain_pending_wakes` against
`has_pending_deferred_wake`, and `run_timed_sweep` against
`nearest_timed_deadline`. Each pair is the same set by definition, and the third
copy, in `nearest_timed_deadline`'s prose, had already drifted (it omitted
`CPUFREQ_WAITQ`). Each set is now one list — `DEFERRED_WAKE_QUEUES` and
`TIMED_QUEUES` — that all four paths fold over, so the property is structural
and the test is a deterministic membership assertion touching no sibling state.

**Found on the way:** `CALL_WAITQ`'s rustdoc still claimed every waiter
registers `NO_DEADLINE` and the timed sweep never touches it. The async
`call_post` transport (`fs::blkclient`) and a `CallReply` wait-set member both
register finite deadlines; only the comment inside `run_timed_sweep` said so,
and this change removed it. Corrected on the queue itself.

The rule the record keeps: a host test may read a process-global wait-queue
flag only monotonically and only its own — set, then observe set. Registering
on a global queue, sweeping one, or reading a flag it did not set is a race
against whichever sibling owns it.

## D118 — process-global kernel registries whose host tests take no guard (PARTLY FIXED)

D117 is one instance of a family. Several `kernel/core` subsystems keep one
machine's worth of process-global state that concurrently-running host tests
share, and only some of those tests hold the guard that state needs. The
pattern that works is already in the tree: `cpufreq::with_mechanism_lock`,
whose own prose states that this module's tests, the syscall-handler tests and
the dispatch-loop tests *all* hold the one lock, which is why it lives beside
the state rather than beside any one test module.

**Fixed here.**

- `cpufreq::an_unbound_machine_does_no_governor_accounting` was deliberately
  outside `with_mechanism`, which also put it outside `with_mechanism_lock` —
  so a sibling's *bound* machine was what its hooks saw, and it read the
  governor accounting that binding legitimately did (`gov_util` 2621, expected
  0; 1 failure in 120 whole-crate shuffled runs). It now holds the lock
  without taking a binding, which is what "an unbound machine" has to mean.
- The five `fs_lock` syscall tests named distinct `FileId`s, which stops them
  seeing *each other's* locks but not `filelock_tests`' entry reset: that
  clears the whole registry, so a reset landing while these held a lock made
  the conflicting request they assert is refused succeed instead
  (`Ok(0)` where `Err(WouldBlock)` was expected). The guard and its reset now
  live beside the registry as `filelock::registry_guard`, held by both test
  modules — the `lock_fixture` returns it, so a case added later cannot forget
  it.

**Open — and the axis is identity, not the registry.** Guarding the call
registry did *not* stop `call_reap_times_out_once_the_deadline_passes`: it
failed once more in 600 shuffled runs with 29 call tests holding the new
guard. The cause is the one `test_boot::claim_task` already documents — a call
path reads kernel state keyed by task id alone, so a concurrent test naming
the same id cancels an in-flight call out from under its owner, and the reap
answers `NotFound` where the deadline should have said `WouldBlock`. The
endpoint *creator* took a claimed id; the *caller* was the literal `2`. That
one test now claims its principal for all four identity sites (the caps record
derives its `ProcessId` from the same number, so they move together), and it
has not recurred.

**Two more closed the same way.** A 500-run shuffle after the first fix
produced three failures, and two were the same identity defect:

- `syscalls::call_post_then_reap_round_trips` — four identity sites, all
  meaning "me", now one claimed principal.
- `syscalls::call_peer_seat_reports_the_live_lease_of_the_in_service_peer` —
  the *client* that posts the call owns the in-flight state, so it is the id
  that had to be claimed. Note what claiming it exposed: the literal `7` was
  also the `SeatOwner` the test acquires and asserts on eviction, so changing
  only the caller made the test fail deterministically with `SeatNotOwner`.
  The claimed id is threaded through the seat owner too. This is the concrete
  reason the 297-site sweep below cannot be mechanical: a literal that means
  "me" in one line means "this named party" three lines later.

**Still open, and honestly unexplained.**
`console::cooked_foreground_maps_ctrl_c_to_a_queued_interrupt` failed once in
500 runs and its output was not captured. It is *not* the obvious candidates:
it already holds `procsignal::foreground_test_lock`, every other user of that
state holds it too, and its device and queue come from `filter_device`, which
leaks a fresh pair per call. The untested lead is that
`install_foreground_signal` is install-once while `init.rs` installs the
*concrete* hook, so a test driving the boot path first would leave the real
hook in place and `ensure_foreground_hook_for_test` ignores its own failed
install — order-dependent, at about the right rate. It did not recur in 1200
runs after the two fixes above, which settles nothing: it was seen at 1-in-500
and 1200 clean runs cannot distinguish "fixed" from "not yet seen".

**The identity sweep, not attempted.** 300 of `syscalls.rs`'s 450 tests name
the shared low identity, over 948 literal sites (`make_caps_record(2, …)` 259,
`SecTaskId(2)` 310, `ProcessId(2)` 379). The structural form is to make an
isolated identity the *default* a test gets, so a case added later is isolated
without its author knowing the hazard exists. The helpers exist —
`test_boot::claim_task` for "me" and `claim_peer_task` for each further party,
from the same 16-id block (D147) — so what is left is the sweep itself. Only a
test that genuinely names a second party keeps a literal, and the seat case
above shows those exist and must be found per test rather than assumed away.
Literals still key state the reclaim path scrubs, and are the sweep's first
sites: `call_cancel_withdraws_the_posted_request` posts as `2` and the two
`call_create_*` tests own an endpoint as `5`, safe only because every test
that reclaims a literal holds the registry guard too — save
`land_pending_kill_records_the_signalled_exit_and_reclaims`, which reclaims `9`
holding none, safe only because nothing keys scrubbed state on `9`.

**What a green run is worth here: nothing.** Observed rates are 1–3 failures
per 500 runs, and long clean stretches appear either side of an unchanged tree
(400 clean before a fix, 1200 clean after). Neither the whole-project gate nor
a repeated suite run can distinguish this class; only the shuffled stress can,
and only in aggregate.

## D119 — a wired path-backed descriptor was refused to a child holding no `CAP_FS_ACCESS` (FIXED)

**Where.** `syscalls::apply_attach_wires`, and the authority `PathAuthority::of`
resolves for the descriptor it produces.

**Mechanism.** A wire cloned the parent's `OpenFile` into the child with its
backing unchanged, so the child held an `OpenBacking::Path`. A path backing is
deliberately re-resolved and re-authorised against whoever *uses* it — that is
what makes a revoked capability stop working mid-open — so `PathAuthority::of`
read the **child's** uid and capability set, and `admit()` demanded
`CAP_FS_ACCESS`. Every `fs_read` and `fs_stat` on the wired descriptor was
therefore `PermissionDenied`, for exactly the programs the hand-off exists for:
a viewer deliberately requests no filesystem capability. `fd_grant` was
unaffected, because `OpenBacking::Delegated` carries the grantor's captured
identity precisely so a capability-less holder can read what it was handed — so
the *picker* route worked and the *file-manager* route did not, and
`launch_viewer`'s own rustdoc claimed the behaviour the code refused.

**Why it needed a decision, and what was decided.** The fix grants authority
across a spawn, so whether *any* wired descriptor confers the parent's reach —
rather than only one minted for the purpose — was the User's call. It does. A
wire is the parent naming one of its own open descriptors and one child it is
itself creating, having chosen that child's image and a subset of its own
capabilities; it confers nothing the parent could not confer anyway, since a
parent that can wire a pipe can already pump the file's bytes down it. What the
wire adds is zero-copy and seekability, not reach. The child still cannot
re-open the path: it holds no `CAP_FS_ACCESS`, so `fs_open` refuses, and the
captured authority is bound to that one descriptor.

**The fix — conferral onto the existing delegation, not a second carrier.**
`OpenFile::conferred_to_child` re-expresses a path backing as an
`OpenBacking::Delegated` carrying the spawning parent's captured uid and
effective set, sharing the one open file description so a redirected child
still walks the file with its parent. It is applied to every resolved wire,
not only an explicit handle, because an inherited standard stream is the same
descriptor reaching the same child by a different spelling.

A delegation is the right carrier once the extent ceiling is honest about the
two grantors, so `DelegatedFile::write_ceiling` became `Option<u64>`:
`fd_grant` attenuates and always names a ceiling (its `is_write() == (ceiling
> 0)` check still refuses an unbounded writable *grant*), a parent passing on
its own reach names none, and `PathAuthority` reads the field directly rather
than re-wrapping it. A second `Inherited` backing was considered and rejected:
it would have duplicated `DelegatedFile` and its authority resolution, grown a
third arm at every match site that behaved identically to `Delegated`, and
bought no invariant — an unbounded writable captured-identity descriptor is
representable either way, and what actually holds the line is `fd_grant`'s own
check.

It is never a widening. The parent could perform every operation itself; a
child holding *more* than its parent is attenuated to the parent's captured
set; and a backing that is already a delegation passes through carrying its
own grantor's identity rather than being re-captured, so a spawn cannot
launder authority its holder was never given.

**Also fixed, found by the same reading.** A **directory** handle could be
wired onto a standard slot. A standard slot is a byte stream, and a
directory's authority is a listing and a namespace to open through — the
reason `fd_grant` declines one — while the direction check alone admits one on
`stdin`, since `READ | DIRECTORY` is a legitimate open. It is now refused
`OutOfRange` at the wire. A directory cannot instead arrive by *inheritance*:
a wire is the only thing that installs an entry behind a standard slot and
descriptor numbers are allocated above them, so no slot a wire inherits from
ever holds one. What may be conferred at all is the one question
`OpenFile::delegatable_path` answers, now shared by `fd_grant` and the
conferral so the two can never disagree.

A conferred descriptor is consequently not a lock or watch subject, exactly as
a granted one is not, because both re-resolve under the holder's own identity;
nothing in the tree does either on a standard descriptor (`flock` opens its
own path), so this narrows no live caller.

**Proved by.** `spawn_confers_the_parents_reach_on_a_wired_path_descriptor`
(a real wired spawn: the conferred backing, the captured uid and effective
set, no invented ceiling, no `own_path`, and the parent's own close leaving
the child's descriptor intact),
`a_conferred_descriptor_reads_under_the_conferring_identity` (a
capability-less holder of a different uid reads under the parent's captured
identity, and a read-only conferral never becomes writable),
`conferring_widens_no_backing_but_a_path` (a delegation keeps its
own grantor, the description is shared, a directory is never conferred), and
`spawn_refuses_a_directory_handle_behind_a_standard_slot`. Each fails on the
unfixed tree and passes after.

## D120 — a per-CPU guarded-copy republish was refused, halting every aarch64 secondary (FIXED)

The one site withheld from the `FnCell` callback-slot migration. Migrating
`kernel/arch/api/src/uaccess.rs` failed three aarch64 `cpus=4` verticals
deterministically — `kernel-arch-boot-aarch64`, `ipi-smp-qemu-aarch64`,
`mem-pin-migration-qemu-aarch64` — each as `secondary cpu start failed cpu=1
cause=no_online_ack`, with single-CPU verticals passing.

**The mechanism.** `exceptions::init_vectors` arms the fault-windowed user copy
alongside the EL1 vector table, and on this port it runs **per CPU** — the
boot path and `production_secondary_entry` both call it. The old slot was an
`AtomicUsize` whose install answered `Ok` to a re-install of the same routine,
via an `existing == raw` comparison of function-pointer addresses; the
secondary's republish therefore succeeded. `FnCell::claim` is strictly
set-once and reports `false` for a repeat of the same routine, so the migrated
install returned `AlreadyInstalled`, `init_vectors` took its fail-closed
`halt_current_cpu()` branch, and the core stopped before `mark_online` — which
is precisely `no_online_ack`. riscv64 and x86_64 were unaffected because their
installs are boot-hart/BSP-only.

The investigation that withheld the file recorded the slot as runtime-inert
because every `install_guarded_copy` caller looked like `#[cfg(test)]`. That
was read off the *host* build: each port's `install()` is
`cfg(all(target_arch = …, target_os = "none"))`, so the one real caller is
invisible on the host and present on exactly the target that failed.

**The fix — publication, not a set-once claim.** The idempotency the seam
needs cannot be built on an address comparison: two coercions of one `fn` item
are not guaranteed to share an address, so `existing == raw` can report
"different routine" for the same one. It fails closed on the good case and is
blind to a genuinely wrong occupant, because a linked image holds exactly one
such routine — the sole installer is the one port compiled into it.
`install_guarded_copy` is therefore infallible and last-writer-wins, and
`InstallGuardedCopyError` is gone along with the three ports' `Result` and the
two halt branches. "One routine per image" is a property of the source,
enforced by there being one installer, not by a runtime address test.

**Coverage.** The three verticals above are the fail-before/pass-after
reproducer (249 ms / 67 ms / 210 ms at `cpus=4`). The unit test adds the
republish property directly: a second publication of the same routine leaves
the dispatch unchanged, which is what lets a per-CPU arming path install
unconditionally.

**The comparison class it belonged to.** The same loaded-pointer-versus-fresh-
coercion comparison sat in ~35 assertions across `kernel/arch/api`, all four
ports, `kernel/tairix-kernel`'s three preempt-wiring modules and `lib/rt`,
passing only because rustc dedupes a coercion within a crate. It was spelled
three ways — `f as usize`, `f as *const () as usize`, and
`core::ptr::fn_addr_eq` — and a sweep for the first two missed every instance
of the third, which is the idiomatic one. Each site now derives both sides
from a single coercion: a `let` binding in a test, and in the wiring modules a
`static` the installer and the test share, so the property those tests exist
for ("the slot holds the *shared* kernel-core callback, not a port-local
restatement") is asserted against the pointer the install actually stored.

Miri is the oracle for it, and it earns the name here: with the old spelling
`preempt::tests::the_timer_callback_round_trips` and
`the_preempt_callback_round_trips` in `kernel/arch/x86_64` **fail** under
`cargo miri test`, and pass after. `kernel/arch/api` is now an enrolled `xtask
miri` target, so this class is held there by the stage rather than by an ad-hoc
run; the three paging *ports* stay out of the stage on an
independent class — `context.rs`'s `u64`→pointer stack-frame write — now
that D56 has cleared their page-table walks. See that entry.

The three wiring modules no longer each carry their own copy of the coerced
callbacks: `crate::preempt_callbacks` holds one `static` per callback and every
installer and test reads the pointer from there, so two ports cannot drift and
the `CpuId`-versus-`u32` spelling (a type alias, so the same type twice) is
gone. What stays per port is what genuinely differs — which slots exist, x86_64
having no separate reschedule slot.

---

## D124 — the kthread resume handle round-tripped a control-block pointer through a `usize` (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `cpu_state::ResumeHandle` published the task's control block
as `data: usize` alongside an `unsafe fn(usize, TaskAction)` thunk, and
`suspend_with` cast it back with `data as *mut ThreadControl<C, S>`. The round
trip **strips the pointer's provenance**: the thunk then reaches the block
through a pointer the compiler believes aliases nothing, so it is entitled to
reorder or elide the control-block accesses the suspend path makes — the
`Yielder` field addresses, the action write, the saved-context read the switch
consumes. Nothing about the erasure required it. The sibling `LiveSpacePtr`, in
the same module, already carried a real pointer with a doc explaining why.

It also cost the crate its oracle: under `-Zmiri-strict-provenance` an
int-to-pointer cast is unsupported, so the interpreter aborted at the first
suspend and could check nothing else in `kernel/core` (D123).

**Fix.** The handle carries `NonNull<()>` and an
`unsafe fn(NonNull<()>, TaskAction)` thunk. Erasing the pointee's type — the
block is generic over the port's context-switch and stack types — is a
*pointer* cast, which leaves provenance intact, so each thunk recovers its own
`NonNull<ThreadControl<C, S>>` with `.cast()` and `suspend_with` is typed
throughout. The fields are private and `ResumeHandle::suspend` is the only
route to the thunk, so a caller cannot pair a thunk with an address of its
own choosing; the two obligations sit where each is knowable — `new` carries
the pointer/thunk pairing (its one caller, `publish_resume`, is
monomorphised over the pair), `suspend` carries liveness and exclusive
ownership (which the publication protocol gives its one caller,
`reschedule_current`). `Send` is an explicit `unsafe impl` with the protocol
as its justification, as `LiveSpacePtr`'s is.

`dispatch_step` derives one `NonNull` from its `&mut` and hands the raw
pointer its field accesses use off *that*, rather than taking a second
reborrow — which would invalidate the first under Stacked Borrows.

**The task-entry seam is a genuine integer, and now says so.** The *other*
crossing, `dispatch_step` → `prepare(…, trampoline::<C, S>, arg)` →
`trampoline(arg: usize)`, cannot carry a pointer: the port stashes the
argument in the seeded frame and its assembly loads it into the argument
register, so no pointer survives that leg. It is spelled
`block.expose_provenance()` / `with_exposed_provenance_mut` rather than a bare
`as` cast either end — the same treatment `WindowStack`'s pages got in D121 —
so the one place an address is genuinely the right representation is visible
as a deliberate choice rather than indistinguishable from the defect above.
The trampoline never runs on the host (the recorder's `switch` transfers no
control), so this weakens no oracle.

**Proved by.** A targeted oracle run, because `tairix-kernel-core` is **not**
enrolled in the gate's miri stage and D123 records why it still cannot be:

```
MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p tairix-kernel-core --lib -- kthread:: cpu_state::
test result: ok. 31 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 1673 filtered out; finished in 59.12s
```

Before the fix the same run aborted at `kthread.rs`'s
`data as *mut ThreadControl<C, S>` with "integer-to-pointer casts … are not
supported", checking nothing after it. Among the 31 are
`reschedule_current_suspends_a_published_user_task`, which drives publish →
suspend and asserts the switch went `task_ctx` → `dispatch_ctx` on *that*
block, and `kernel_body_suspend_skips_the_cooperative_park_bracket`, the test
the abort fired in.

Until the enrolment lands this proof is a developer's obligation rather than
the gate's, which is exactly what D123 is open about.

## D125 — a host test identified a function by its address, which is unspecified (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `kthread::tests::first_dispatch_step_prepares_then_switches_in`
asserted that the entry `dispatch_step` handed `prepare` equalled
`trampoline::<RecordingCs, BoxStack> as *const () as u64` — two separate
reifications of one function item, compared by address. Rust does not
guarantee that two pointers to the same function compare equal, so the
assertion tested a property the language leaves unspecified. It passed
natively only because LLVM happened to fold the two reifications to one
symbol; under the interpreter it failed outright, and a build with different
inlining or identical-code folding could have gone either way.

Measured rather than argued: three coercions of one `unsafe extern "C" fn`
item yielded `0x1805a6`, `0x1805b2`, `0x1805c0`, and `core::ptr::fn_addr_eq`
on two coercions of the same item answered `false` — the interpreter mints a
fresh address per cast, so code resting on function identity is exposed rather
than accidentally satisfied.

**Fix.** The assertion and the `Recorder::last_entry` field that existed only
to feed it are deleted; the prepare count, the stack top, and the control
block's exposed address — all well-defined — stay. No address-based
replacement is possible: every route to function identity (`as usize`, `==`,
`fn_addr_eq`) is the same unspecified comparison, and the host never transfers
control into the seeded frame, so the entry cannot be identified by its effect
either.

What the assertion reached for is covered where the control transfer is real:
every QEMU kthread vertical runs a task body, which is reachable only through
the trampoline entry, and the Arch HAL's own
`prepares_a_runnable_in_bounds_frame` conformance vertical covers `prepare`
seeding a runnable frame at the entry it was given. The test says so where the
assertion used to be, so a reader does not mistake the gap for an oversight.

**Proved by.** The test passes natively *and* under the interpreter (the D124
run above covers it). Only the D123 enrolment would keep it that way
automatically; until then it is a developer's obligation.

## D123 — `kernel/core` is not under the UB oracle (OPEN; `kernel/mem` closed)

**Why it matters.** `cargo xtask ci`'s miri stage interprets only the crates in
`tools/xtask/src/commands/miri.rs`'s `TARGETS`. A green gate says nothing about
an unenrolled crate, so every fix to its `unsafe` rests on a developer
remembering to run the oracle by hand. `lib/kalloc` closed as D126; the window
address and the stack reader closed as the `kheap`/`kstack` and D128 work.

**`kernel/mem` is enrolled and green.** `Scope::LibExcept`, with one skip, and
`Spread::PerCore` so the crate's tests are dealt across the host's cores.

```
cargo xtask miri --package tairix-kernel-mem
xtask: [miri tairix-kernel-mem --lib (part)] 464 tests dealt across 16 processes
every shard ok, 0 leaks; longest shard 374 s against the 2700 s per-job budget
```

Five things had to change before it could be:

* **`DirectPhysMap::translate` minted a pointer per call.** The map now holds
  the root for the region the MMU established (`NonNull<u8>`), derives every
  translation from it, and hoists the representability check into the
  constructor, so a window no pointer could address is refused where it is
  *declared*. `new`/`identity` are `unsafe` and fallible — the obligation sits
  where the fact is known — and `from_root` roots a host test in memory it
  owns. An identity window's alias of physical zero is the null pointer, so
  such a map addresses from its second page, which is what `translate` already
  refused and the frame allocator's permanent zero-page reservation defends.
  ~40 guest-kernel call sites carry the `unsafe` and fail closed.
* **Every leaked fixture became accountable.** `framepages`, `pagetables`,
  `kvslots`, `live` and `ramzip::tier` shared one `Once`-cell backing
  (`kernel/mem/src/test_fixture.rs`, reached through `frame_backing!` so each
  expansion gets its own pool); `kvmap` rebased onto `KernelWindow::from_root`
  over real memory, which also retired an `at_address` mint a host test could
  not interpret. `live::press_to` ended with `core::mem::forget(held)` to "leak
  the held frames so the band stays" — `Frame` is a plain index with no drop
  glue, so that held nothing and leaked only the vector.
* **`slab`'s proptest wanted the working directory.** Filing a counterexample
  needs a cwd isolation refuses. `lib/sync` had solved this locally, so the
  rule moved into `tairix_fuzzseed::prop::config(native, interpreted)` and both
  call sites read it.
* **Sweeps were scaled where the extent is a sample, not an assertion.**
  `seal`'s nonce uniqueness (89 s → 3 s); `ramzip::tier`'s three
  `bench_evidence_*` round trips, whose printed latency is explicitly "not a
  guarantee"; and `dma`'s reclamation rounds (716 s → 288 s at three of six),
  where drift shows up comparing any round against the first.
* **The crate is dealt across the host's cores.** Miri runs one interpreted
  thread at a time and reports a single CPU, so libtest took all 465 tests
  back to back in one single-core process — twenty minutes against a
  forty-five-minute budget, which the CI runner overran while the stage's
  other ten jobs sat finished and the rest of the machine idled.
  `Spread::PerCore` enumerates the crate through the test binary's own
  `--list` and deals the names round-robin across one process per core, so the
  partition cannot omit a test added later and the makespan falls to the
  longest single test rather than their sum.

**What must not be scaled, learned the hard way.**
`ramzip::tier::band_cap_is_enforced_and_escalation_is_deterministic` looked like
slack at 50 pages. The cap is charged against *compressed* footprint, so
reaching the two pages it allows takes that many compressible pages: scaled to
six, the refusal never came and the assertion failed. It passed natively the
whole time — only the interpreted run could catch it. The count is the
assertion, as with `driver_store::the_driver_count_is_bounded` and `pty`'s
`PIPE_CAPACITY`.

**The one skip, and why it is budget rather than a dodge.**
`dma::…a_full_span_window_serves_a_multi_device_enclosure_lazily` reserves a
full gigabyte of window and streams thirteen 32-page device regions through it,
zeroed on carve and volatile-cleared on release. Interpreted, the per-byte
aliasing bookkeeping over that volume costs **four hours** — 91% of the crate.
The DMA pool itself is not at fault and no defect was found there: `SlotWindow::new`
is `const fn` O(1), `DmaWindowMap::new` starts `slot_used: Vec::new()`,
`ensure_slots` grows only to the chosen run, and `find_free_run` terminates at
the bookkeeping end because an unrecorded slot reads free — nothing is
proportional to the 262 144-slot span, so the test's own lazy-bookkeeping claim
holds. The cost is the byte volume, which is the realistic-enclosure part of the
scenario rather than the property under test. It passes when run, and all four
`unsafe` sites in `dma.rs` are on the alloc/free/bytes paths the other 25 tests
in the module reach.

**What that volume actually costs, measured.** The zero-on-free clear is
`zeroize`'s volatile byte loop, so a page is 4096 individually interpreted
writes, and the aliasing model — not the writes — is nearly all of the bill:
the sibling reclamation test ran 716 s under Stacked Borrows, 208 s under Tree
Borrows and 44 s with the model off. Stacked Borrows stands regardless (it is
the stricter of the two and the one intrusive pointer code is likeliest to
violate); the lever is the number of interpreted bytes, which is why the round
count scaled and the enclosure test stays skipped.

**Miri's clock is virtual — measure the stage from outside.** The
`finished in …` line a test binary prints under the interpreter is not wall
time and can exceed it severalfold (`live` reported 267 s against 79 s real;
`dma` reported 702 s against 14 584 s). Every per-module figure taken from that
line is fiction.

**The stage cost is 383 s**, set by the longest `kernel/mem` shard (374 s) and
`lib/collections`' whole run (341 s) — two comparable jobs rather than one
dominant one. `docs/src/contributing.md` carries the measured figure.

**Still open: `kernel/core`, and the blocker is not the budget.** The previous
record said "what is left is the 1097 s-vs-287 s budget alone". That is wrong.
Every whole-crate run aborted on a fatal provenance error *before* the leak
check could run, so the leak surface had never been seen:

* **577 test-side `Box::leak` sites** across ~40 fixture types (`TestSink` ×79,
  `RwLock` ×50, `ProgramRegistry` ×34, `RecordingFs` ×31, `StaticHwTree` ×22, …),
  plus 70 production ones whose design is "kernel state is never freed".
  `launch_cache::` alone reports 172 leak errors. Making these accountable is
  D128's `panic::` campaign (493 leaks, one module) repeated crate-wide; several
  of the consumers take `&'static` only because production holds them in
  statics, so relaxing those bounds is part of it.
* **The budget half is largely done.** Fixture crypto nobody asserted on was the
  cost: `groups::` ×5 and `introspect_source::` paid a PBKDF2 the identity build
  never reads (1227 s), `launch_cache::` re-verified the same bundle signature
  per test (831 s → 121 s, now verified once and shared), and `fs::fscache`'s
  eviction stream and large-document reads were scaled (291 s).
  `appspawn::`'s 15 ed25519 tests carry no `unsafe` and are a legitimate
  `LibExcept` skip when the crate is enrolled.

**Done when:** `kernel/core` is in `TARGETS` and green. An exclusion is
legitimate only for a module that carries no `unsafe` and passes when run —
budget, never a dodged finding.

## D126 — the kernel heap allocator threaded its free list and slab pages through integers (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `lib/kalloc`'s `FreeListAllocator` moved block addresses through
`usize` and synthesised pointers back out of them, which strips provenance: the
compiler then believes those pointers alias nothing, and is free to reorder or
elide the in-band header writes the free-list algebra depends on. Four shapes
carried it — the `Block.prev_phys` physical back-link a coalesce dereferences,
`split_front`'s `block.as_ptr() as usize + front`, `page_of`'s mask of an
object address down to its granule base, and a returned region's header rebuilt
from a stored address.

**Fix.** Every address now travels as a pointer.

* `Block.prev_phys` is `Option<NonNull<Block>>`. The null-pointer niche keeps
  the header two words, which `assert!(size_of::<Block>() == HEADER)` pins
  because a payload sits `HEADER` bytes into its block.
* **`FLAG_REGION_START` is gone.** "No predecessor" and "first in its region"
  are one fact, and holding it twice is a divergence waiting to happen, so
  `prev_phys.is_none()` is the only spelling. Two flags remain.
* `split_front` and the region header step with `byte_add` / `byte_sub`, which
  carry provenance where the integer arithmetic destroyed it.
* `page_of` steps the object's *own* pointer back by its offset within the
  page rather than rebuilding a masked address. The object was derived from
  the page, so walking the same distance back reaches the descriptor the page
  really owns — which is what the earlier note doubted was reachable without
  routing the provenance in from the region. It is `unsafe` now, because an
  out-of-bounds step is UB where a synthesised dangling pointer merely was not
  yet; the sole caller already holds the contract that discharges it.

**The structural control.** The crate denies `implicit_provenance_casts`
(behind `strict_provenance_lints`, which the lint genuinely needs — without
the gate it degrades to an unknown-lint warning and silently checks nothing),
so a relapse is a build failure rather than something only an interpreted run
would notice. That lint is what found the fixture half: the test `HeapSource`
kept its arena as a `usize` base and rebuilt every carve from it, and eleven
test bodies took addresses with `as usize`.

**The fixtures are accountable to the interpreter.** A deliberate leak cannot
be told from a real one, so the bootstrap arena is now owned by a `Fixture`
that frees it on drop (`Deref`ing to the allocator, so no test body changed),
and the `MockSource` — which must be `&'static` to install, so nothing could
ever free a heap arena it owned — sits in a `static` per macro expansion over
a `static` arena. One pair per expansion, so two concurrently-running tests
never share a source. `MockState` lost its `base` and `len` fields: the base
is a pointer outside the lock and the length was `MOCK_ARENA` copied.

**Proved by.** `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p
tairix-kalloc` fails before (unsupported int-to-pointer cast) and passes after
— 28 tests in 62 s, inside the stage's 287 s makespan — and the crate is in
`TARGETS`, so `ci` keeps it that way. The enrolment is not vacuous:
instrumenting all four shapes with a panic trips 22 of the 28 tests, so the
oracle interprets each of them. The earlier claim that those 28 tests never
reached these paths was wrong — they always did; nothing had ever interpreted
them.

## D128 — the panic backtrace's stack reader rebuilt a pointer from an integer address (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `tairix_arch_api::backtrace::StackBounds` was a pair of `u64`
addresses and `StackReader::read_word` takes a `u64`, so the production
reader had nothing to derive from and could only cast: `kernel/core::panic`'s
`RawStackReader` did `read_volatile(addr as *const u64)`. The walk was
careful in every *other* respect — both words proved inside the port's
vouched bounds, the frame pointer aligned and strictly increasing, the depth
hard-capped — but each read went through a pointer the compiler believes
aliases nothing, so the unwinder could not be *checked*: under
`-Zmiri-strict-provenance` the cast is refused outright.

**The root now travels with the region, and the reader holds it.** The
ledger's earlier sketch put the root inside `StackBounds`. That is wrong, and
the reason is worth keeping: `walk` is **one** unwinder over **two** kinds of
address. `RawStackReader`'s are host-dereferenceable kernel addresses;
`crash::UserStackReader`'s are *foreign-address-space* user addresses it
resolves through `copy_in`/`PhysMap` and never casts at all. A root in
`StackBounds` would be a field the user walk has nothing to put in. So
`StackBounds` stays the pure validation window both share, and the root lives
in the thing that dereferences:

* `KernelStackRegion` (already the `ContextSwitch::prepare` stack descriptor,
  so no sibling type) gained `enclosing` — the one int-to-pointer mint, the
  containment rule shared by all ports — plus `word_ptr`, the only
  derivation, and `base_addr`/`contains_addr`/`base_ptr`. `StackBounds` is
  reached only as `From<KernelStackRegion>`, read back off the very pointer
  the reads derive from, so window and root cannot drift.
* `CpuStateCapture::stack_bounds` became `boot_stack() -> Option<KernelStackRegion>`;
  the three bare-metal ports mint their linker-reserved boot stack there, where
  the reservation is a fact only the port holds. wasm32 stays `None`.
* `RawStackReader` holds the region and derives each read. Nothing casts.

**The kthread-stack gap this exposed, closed with it.** `stack_bounds` only
ever vouched for the *boot* stack, so a panic on a kthread stack failed the
containment check, returned `None`, and dropped the walk entirely — almost
every post-boot fatal fault printed registers and **no frame chain**, exactly
when a chain is most needed. The dispatcher now publishes the stack it is
switching into (`CpuState::running_stack`, an `AtomicPtr` because an address
would discard the provenance again — the reason `lock_sites` stores a
pointer), retracts it on switch-back, and `panic` resolves the running task's
stack before the port's boot stack.

Neither source is believed blind, and the same test does two jobs: a region
answers only when the captured `sp` is inside it, which is *also* the
liveness proof — an `sp` inside a region means the CPU is executing on it,
hence its pages are mapped and a publication a retired task left behind
cannot be mistaken for the current one. No lock is taken on the fault path,
and the slot is written and read only by its own CPU.

**Proved by.** `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p
tairix-kernel-core --lib -- panic::` — 25 tests, 16.84 s, leak checking on.
Reinstating the cast in place aborts it at `panic.rs`'s `read_volatile`
("integer-to-pointer casts ... are not supported"); the file was restored by
copy and its hash confirmed. Three regression tests carry the behaviour:
`panic_dump_unwinds_a_kthread_stack_the_dispatcher_published` (the port
honestly declines, so any frame past `frame_0` can only have come from the
publication), `panic_dump_emits_no_chain_when_no_stack_is_vouched_for`, and
`the_published_running_stack_answers_only_for_an_sp_on_it`; `word_ptr` and
`enclosing` have their own containment tests in `kernel/arch/api`.

**The fixtures had to become accountable too.** `panic::`'s tests leaked 493
allocations through `Box::leak`, which the earlier abort had masked and which
the oracle cannot tell from a real leak. Seventeen sinks became plain locals,
`drive_panic_dump` returns its records rather than a borrow of a sink it
owns, the process-wide quiesce liveness tables became one shared `static`
pair, and the installed-console fixture (`ConsoleDevice::new` genuinely takes
`&'static`) became a `static` cleared per round. A fixture that planted its
stack image by indexing its own `Vec` after taking the region also had to
plant *through* the region instead — reborrowing the slice retires the root,
which Stacked Borrows caught and which is the discipline under test.

**Still not enrolled.** `kernel/core` remains outside `miri`'s `TARGETS`; its
remaining blocker is the leak surface D123 now records, not the budget.

## D133 — a task could grow another task's pending-delegation table without bound — FIXED

`AddressSpaceRegistry::mint_fd_delegation` inserted one entry per distinct
`(path, captured authority, flags)` a grantor handed a recipient, bounded only
by duplicate suppression, and a long-lived recipient kept each until it
redeemed it. The desktop session was the natural target: the file manager
mints a delegation to it before asking whether an instance is running, and the
session left it pending when it answered "not running".

Each pending delegation now records the process that minted it and is charged
to it: a grantor may have at most `FD_DELEGATIONS_PENDING_PER_GRANTOR` (64)
pending to one recipient, and a fresh one past that is refused with
`LimitExceeded` while the earlier ones stay redeemable. Charging the grantor
rather than the recipient is what keeps one grantor from exhausting the
session's table for every other — a per-recipient ceiling would let any
`CAP_FS_ACCESS` holder refuse the file manager's hand-overs. A grantor's
pending delegations are dropped when it is withdrawn, so processes that mint
and exit cannot accumulate them; that rests on D269, since a successor cannot
mint under a number before its predecessor's withdraw. The recipient's own
handles still never repeat, because its table is kept, not rebuilt. The session
declines a document nothing took (`DocumentRelay::decline`), so an honest
refusal leaves nothing pending. Residue: D272.

## D139 — `lib/rt` is not under the UB oracle, and cannot be enrolled as the registry's scopes stand (OPEN)

`tairix-rt` carries a large hand-written `unsafe` core — the process heap,
the syscall wrappers' pointer marshalling, the shared-memory mappings — and
appears in no `miri::TARGETS` row, so none of it has ever been interpreted.

Pointing the oracle at the crate aborts the whole run on the first heap test:
`Heap::alloc` turns the address its pager seam answered into a pointer, which
`-Zmiri-strict-provenance` refuses as an **unsupported operation**. That is
what the crate *is* — a userland allocator over a seam whose host double
fabricates addresses — not a provenance bug in it, and the same refusal that
`kernel/mem` resolved (D123/D126) by giving its direct physical map a
provenance root does not obviously transfer: there is no real allocation on
the host for a fabricated arena address to be derived from.

Enrolling it therefore needs the registry to admit a *second* reason for
scoping a target to less than its crate. `Scope::LibExcept`'s contract today
is explicitly budget-only ("a skipped module carries no `unsafe` and passes
when it is run"), while the charter's own rule admits excluding what the
interpreter **refuses** as well as what it cannot afford — only excluding a
module that *reports* undefined behaviour is forbidden. Widening that
contract, and then owning whatever the remaining ~250 interpreted tests
surface, is the work.

Noticed while adding `MappedGrant` (the granted-region mapping the desktop
writes a wallpaper preview into). Not absorbed: that mapping's own `unsafe`
is unreachable from a host build — the trap seam answers `HOST_NO_TRAP`, so
both `MappedGrant::map` and `SharedRegion::create` refuse before any slice is
built, which `shm`'s own two host tests pin and which the oracle confirms
(`MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p tairix-rt shm::`,
2 passed) — so the change adds no uninterpreted reachable `unsafe`, and the
enrolment gap is the crate's, not this change's.

## D137 — the blocking `wait` parked the calling thread but registered its process (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `KernelProcessWait::wait` parked the **calling thread** and
registered the **process** on the wait queue:

```rust
crate::waitq::PROCWAIT_WAITQ.register(parent.0, crate::waitq::NO_DEADLINE);
let parked = reschedule_current(cpu, RescheduleAction::Park);
```

`WaitQueue::register` takes a `TaskId` — the schedulable entity, so what a
park, an unpark, or a wake must name — and `kernel/sched/api`'s `TaskId` is
`pub type TaskId = u64`, so `ProcessId(pub u64)`'s `.0` compiled silently.
`kill_pending(parent.0)` was the same slip a second time, and a
security-relevant one in its own right: the kill gate's owed deaths are keyed
by **thread**, so a non-leader thread
parked in `wait` consulted the leader's row and could never observe a
termination deferred against itself — an unkillable waiter surviving its own
group's teardown. This is exactly the
misuse class the `ProcessId` newtype exists to catch (`plans/THREADS.md`
decision 3); the retype caught the process-wait *table*, which is correctly
process-scoped, but could not catch the *park*, because the alias erases the
distinction at `.0`. Every other park site in the kernel passes a thread
(`caller.task_id.0`, `task`, `sched_task`) — this was the only one that did
not.

A process id **is** its leader thread's task id, so a single-threaded caller
had always worked. A **multi-threaded** caller reaping from a non-leader
thread registered the *leader*, parked *itself*, and was never unparked:
`record_exit` → `procwait_wake` → `wake_all` unparked the leader spuriously
and left the real waiter asleep for the rest of the boot.

**What it looked like from outside.** `view.app` failed to display its *third*
document — open two, close the second, open a third and the window stays
blank. Its decode worker thread owns one `ParserSandbox` per window; closing a
window submits `Work::Forget`, which drops that sandbox →
`RtLauncher::dispose` → `wait_exit(pid)` → the worker thread parks for ever.
The worker desk is one slot behind a `Desk::outstanding` latch, so no later
open or render was ever submitted: the third window opened, its `Request::Open`
was never carried out, and every remaining window silently stopped
re-rendering. Three documents opened *without* a close worked, which is why
the `handover_qemu_aarch64` vertical never saw it.

**The fix.** `ProcessWait::wait` takes the waiting `TaskId` beside the
`ProcessId` its table is keyed by. The table stays process-keyed — a child
belongs to the thread group and any of its threads may reap it — and only the
park, the deregister, and the `kill_pending` check name the thread. Passing a
`ProcessId` there no longer compiles. `ProcessWait::poll` is unchanged: it
never parks.

**Its regression tests.** A host test in `kernel/core`: with a caller whose
`TaskId` and `ProcessId` differ — a non-leader thread — the `wait` handler
hands the producer the *calling thread*. It cannot pass before the fix,
because the producer was never told which thread to park. End to end, an
eighth argv-selected role in `tests/integration/threads_program`
(`reapchild`) spawns a child from a non-leader thread and reaps it there;
before the fix the role never returns and the three `threads_qemu_*` verticals
fail on their step budget, after it they exit `0`.

## D138 — the desktop-pressure vertical photographed its baseline before the bar had drawn a slot (FIXED)

**Mechanism.** `tairix-test-desktop-pressure-qemu-aarch64` requires the bar's
leading application slot to be byte-identical between an artwork baseline and
the frame the guest's `PRESSURE_LEFT_NORMAL_MARKER` announces
(`MAX_UNDER_PRESSURE_SLOT_DRIFT = 0.0`). Slot 0 is chosen because the script
never points at, clicks, hovers, or launches it — the autostarted file manager
holds it — so a picture that moves between the frames moved because of what the
desktop did to its own caches. The baseline was gated on `desktop fully
revealed on screen`, and the assertion's rationale quietly assumed the slot was
drawn by then.

It is not. *The desktop being revealed* and *the file manager's slot reaching
the screen* are separate events with **no ordering between them**: the fade is
the session's own, the slot waits on a separate process's bring-up. Both orders
occur — under the 8-way parallel `test --qemu` stage the reveal won by 24 ms
(12.179 against 12.203) where the vertical run alone had the slot 1.65 s
earlier — so the baseline was photographed with slot 0 **empty** and the drift
read 33.4%. Demonstrated in the pixels of the 48×46 rectangle at (71, 716)
that `appbar_slot_rect(theme, 0)` resolves: 4 colours, all bar fill, in the
baseline against 93 including the icon's blue in the later frame. The artwork
was *absent in the baseline and present afterwards* — the opposite of the
"stopped drawing its decoded icon artwork" the message asserted.

**A second race behind it, closed by the same fix.** `APP_BAR_SLOT_SHOWN` is
not the missing gate either, and not only because it drops the revealed half:
a bundle's icon is read and decoded off the serve loop, so the frame a slot
*first* appears in may hold its built-in glyph, with the artwork arriving a
frame or two later. A baseline gated on the slot alone could therefore
photograph the glyph and read the artwork's later arrival as drift, failing
the same assertion from the other direction.

**The fix.** One session-side witness for the conjunction the assertion
actually needs, `APP_BAR_SETTLED` (`userland/gui/session/src/apps.rs`,
"icon-bar slots drawn on the revealed desktop"): one-shot, given on a present
when the screen's own reveal witness has been given (`ScreenFade::revealed`),
the strip seats at least one slot, and no slot is still waiting on a decode
that is coming. `AppBarService::slots` learns the last through the artwork
cache's `owned_artwork`, whose `ArtworkOutcome` distinguishes a decode in
flight from a final refusal — so a bundle that ships no drawable icon settles
on its glyph rather than holding the witness back for ever — and re-seating
the strip returns the fact to its conservative reading until the next
resolution answers it.

The vertical gates both its baseline **and** its pointer script's launch on
that witness, which is what orders them: the runner holds every unsent
pointer step while a dump whose marker has appeared is unverified, so the
baseline is on disk before the first click can put a popup over the wallpaper
the assertion reads. The bound stays 0.0 — it was always right; the gate was
what was wrong. The failure message now names both candidate reasons and how
to tell them apart, instead of asserting the one the evidence contradicted.

**The same assumption in a sibling, fixed with it.**
`autoload_desktop_pointer_script`'s click on the file manager's slot was gated
on the reveal alone, on the reasoning that the autostarted app "holds the slot
by then". It does not, for the same reason; a press into a strip that has not
seated it hits nothing. That click now waits on `APP_BAR_SLOT_SHOWN`, as the
hand-over and file-pick scripts already did. The other bar-reading verticals
were checked and are not exposed: the icon-bar vertical's byte-identity claim
is over slot 2, empty in both of its frames, and the hover vertical takes no
dump and reads no slot.

**Its regression test is the vertical itself**, under the parallel load that
exposed it. The two halves of the witness are host-tested beside the service
(`the_bar_settles_only_once_it_is_revealed_and_holding_its_resolved_pictures`,
`a_bar_slot_whose_artwork_is_refused_settles_on_its_glyph`), each guard
verified to fail the test when removed.

## D167 — a dead driver's DMA memory was freed while its device could still master it — FIXED

A driver that ends with its device still running — a crash, a kill, an exit that
skipped the reset — never returns its DMA memory to the allocator. A space binds
a `DmaCustodian` (`kernel/mem/src/dma.rs`) on its first carve: the driver's
hardware-tree node, its admission generation (`AddressSpaceRegistry` stamps one
on every driver it admits), and the kernel's per-node custody
(`kernel/core/src/dmaquarantine.rs`). `LiveSpace::drop` zeroes, cleans, unmaps
and surrenders each block to it and records `DMA_QUARANTINED` (4091). A later
driver for the node calls `dma_quiesced` (no. 126, `CAP_MEM_DMA`, audited) once
its bring-up has confirmed the device reset, and the kernel frees, scrubbed, the
node's blocks of every earlier generation, recording `DMA_QUARANTINE_RELEASED`
(4092).

What it guarantees:

- **Generations, not ordering.** The exit is recorded — so `devmgr` may spawn a
  successor — before the scheduler's reap drops the dead space, so a block can
  reach custody after its successor released; the node's quiet bound frees such
  a block on arrival, and a block of the releaser's own or a later generation is
  never freed. Sound because a node has at most one live driver (D225).
- **A surprise removal retires the node for good**: what is held frees now, what
  arrives later frees on arrival, and no carve is taken for the node again —
  sound because a node id is never reissued (D225). An orderly removal proves
  nothing about the device, so what its drivers left stays held for the boot.
- **Custody never fails open, and a surrender never allocates.** Every carve
  reserves room for its own surrender, and custody is opened only for a node the
  tree holds (D225). A block no reservation stands behind keeps its frames
  allocated for good; a kernel with no direct physical map wires
  `NULL_DMA_QUARANTINE`, which refuses the carve.
- **A declaration is truthful.** Each DMA-mastering driver declares only after a
  confirmed reset: virtio's `Transport::reset` fails with `DeviceFault` unless
  the status reads back 0; xHCI declares in `UsbDevice::start`, which only a
  completed `HCRST` can reach; GENET waits for `DMA_DISABLED` on both engines;
  EMMC2 declares after its `SRST_HC` bring-up; the VideoCore mailbox service
  declares after a firmware-revision probe, resting on the firmware answering
  property requests in posting order (its metal acceptance is pending,
  `plans/PI.md`), and an exchange drains a stale property completion rather than
  failing on it.
- **A live driver's own frees follow the same rule** (D226, D227). Every
  DMA-owning device type stops or resets its device when it is dropped and
  withholds what it cannot prove released, and a request the device never
  answered keeps its buffers the device's until it hands them back.
- **DMA shared regions join the same custody.** A `shm_create_dma` region
  reserves its creator's node custody for its life; a creator that ends still
  mapping it orphans it, and its frames reach the quarantine under the creator's
  generation when the last mapping goes (`plans/SOUND.md` SND5b).
- **The teardown walk allocates nothing.** `LiveSpace::drop` drains its pages
  through `AddressSpace::unmap_lowest`, and custody records each block into room
  its carve reserved, so a space dying under memory pressure cannot fail for want
  of the memory it is returning.

Regression tests: `kernel/core/src/dmaquarantine/tests.rs` (held until a later
generation releases, late arrival freed, a removed device's memory freed now and
on arrival, custody refused for a gone node, a surrender that allocates nothing,
a block no reservation stands behind kept, the end-to-end `LiveSpace`
surrender); `kernel/mem`'s surrender, reservation and one-custodian-per-space
tests and the `unmap_lowest` drain; `kernel/core/src/syscalls.rs`'s caller-scoped
release, surprise-only retire and quarantine audit; `lib/virtio`'s bounded reset
wait; and per driver a declaration-after-reset test and a wedged-device test
proving the memory withheld — except EMMC2, which has only the wedged-device
tests, and `vcmailbox`, whose buffer is proven withheld on `DmaMailbox` but
whose declaration, made by the freestanding service after its probe, has no
test.

## D168 — the shared device-tree walk emits nodes the firmware marked disabled or reserved, and drivers bind them (OPEN)

`kernel/arch/api/src/fdtwalk.rs`'s `is_emitted` reads no `status` property, so a
node the firmware declared `"disabled"` (not operational) or `"reserved"`
(operational but owned by another software component, Devicetree Specification
v0.4 §2.3.4) is published and matched like any other. On the pinned Pi 4 tree
that is concrete: all six `brcm,bcm2835-i2c` controllers are disabled — the
firmware enables one only when an overlay routes its pins — and the I²C bus
driver is autoloaded onto every one. SND8's PWM and I²S nodes are disabled the
same way.

Not absorbed into SND5, because the rule decides what metal binds: skipping
disabled nodes is right, but it can unbind a path metal already accepts if an
image depends on a node its `config.txt` never enables, so the change needs
each Pi-bound driver's node checked against the image the builder writes. The
fix is `is_emitted` honouring `status` ("okay" and an absent property emit,
anything else does not) with the bus-child look-ahead replaying the same rule,
plus a fixture test that a disabled node and its children are spliced out.

## D169 — stable event ids collide across components (OPEN)

An `EventId` is meant to name one security-relevant decision, but ids are
picked per crate with no registry, and about thirty are claimed by unrelated
emitters, some three ways: 4191/4192 by `drivers/bus/usb/xhci` (domain
recovered/offline), `drivers/storage/raid` (composer ready, member admitted)
and `drivers/storage/volmgr` (RAID candidate); 4142–4146 by
`drivers/input/usb_kbd` and the kernel's root and system mounts; 4150–4157 by
xhci, `usb_mouse` and the kernel supervisor host, 4150 also by the kernel
catalogue's `TaskLatencyOverrun` and a `lib/rt` record; 4166–4173 by
`usb_mouse`, `usb_msd` and the kernel mount and volume services; 4180–4190 by
`volmgr`, `raid_member`, `lib/netchan` and the kernel volume and writeback
services; the kernel catalogue's (`kernel/core/src/audit.rs`)
`FsNodeMutated`/`FsMutationDenied` (4100/4101) by the aarch64 boot's PCIe and
clock records, 4101 also by the xHCI and USB-keyboard ready records, and its
`SystemPower`/`VolumeWritebackFailed` (4133/4134) and
`HwNodeRemoved`/`HwNodeRemoveRefused` (4140/4141) by `tairix-kernel`'s
root-mount and system-volume records (`root_mount.rs`); and 24100/24101 by
`drivers/bus/i2c/bcm2835` inside the range `lib/ssh` declares for itself. A
reader filtering the audit log by id conflates them, which defeats the id.

Some repeats are legitimate and the fix must keep them: one event emitted by
each architecture's sibling (`4_242` in every port's serial driver, the
per-arch `boot.rs` ids) and a tool matching a kernel id (the `tools/xtask`
QEMU scripts). The fix is one id registry — a range per component, the kernel
catalogue one of them — with every emitter taking its ids from its range, the
colliding ids renumbered in place with their docs and script references, and a
`ci` check that fails when one `EventId` value is emitted by two components
outside a declared shared event. That check is its regression test.

## D170 — direct reclaim allocates on the kernel heap, infallibly, under the pressure that triggered it (OPEN)

`LiveSpace::ramzip_reclaim` (`kernel/mem/src/live.rs`) collects every resident
anonymous page into a `Vec` and then sorts and dedups it, and
`ColdScanner::scan` (`kernel/mem/src/coldscan.rs`) builds a second `Vec` of the
cold ones — both with infallible allocation, on the path a memory-pressure
fault drives. A kernel heap that cannot grow at that moment aborts the reclaim
that would have relieved it, and the candidate list costs a word per resident
page of the largest process on every triggering fault. The sort and dedup are
pure cost: `AddressSpace::live_pages` already yields ascending, unique pages.

The fix is a scanner that walks the space's live record itself from its clock
hand — a `BTreeMap` range, ascending and unique by construction — filtering
anonymous pages as it goes, and hands each cold page to the compressor as it
finds it, bounded by `want`, so reclaim allocates nothing. Its regression test
is a reclaim that completes against a heap refusing every allocation, beside
the scanner's existing second-chance tests.

## D171 — a dead address space was torn down with one TLB invalidation per page — FIXED

`LiveSpace::drop` reads the space's `ActiveCpus`: a space active on no CPU — the
normal case, since the last handle a thread could run it through is gone — is
cleared with `AddressSpace::clear_lowest`, which flushes nothing, because every
CPU that ran it discarded its translations when it switched away (D234). A space
still active somewhere, which only a defect elsewhere could produce, is torn
down with a local flush per page and a remote shootdown per batch before any
frame is freed.

## D172 — `usb_msd`'s ancestor attribution reads the tree into a buffer no real tree fits (OPEN)

`drivers/storage/usb_msd/src/program.rs`'s `ancestor_status` reads the whole
`hw_tree_read` snapshot into an 8 KiB stack array (`TREE_SNAPSHOT_BUF`) on its
stall-recovery path and folds `ancestor_imposed_status_from_snapshot` over it.
A snapshot holds a 16-byte header and `HwNode::WIRE_LEN` bytes per node, so the
buffer fits nine nodes (fourteen before `plans/SOUND.md` SND5a widened the node
to sixteen resources). QEMU's aarch64 `virt` tree alone has about forty nodes
before any USB device is attached and the pinned Pi 4 tree several hundred, so
the read fails with `BufferTooSmall` on every realistic machine and the leaf
answers on its own health: a resetting hub or controller is blamed on the disk,
which is the attribution `plans/FIX-IO.md` IO4 exists to make. It fails safe —
no false fault is ever raised — but the feature does not operate, and the
buffer is a fixed capacity a real machine outgrows.

The right fix is a kernel-side answer rather than a bigger buffer: a query that
folds the published health of the caller's own node's ancestor chain in the
kernel, which holds the tree, at the cost of one walk up the chain and no copy.
The alternative is a snapshot reader that grows to the tree once at bring-up and
reuses its buffer on the recovery path, shared with `devmgr`'s
`read_tree_growing` rather than copied. Its regression test is a stall under a
tree larger than the old buffer whose resetting ancestor is attributed.

## D173 — a DMA carve under an addressing limit succeeded only by the order of the free lists — FIXED

A `Dma` grant's addressing limit bounds where its carve may lie, and both
carves that honour one — `dma_alloc` (`DmaWindowMap::alloc_inner`) and
`shm_create_dma` (`LiveSharedMem::alloc_dma_region`, `plans/SOUND.md` SND5b) —
drew a block with `FrameAllocator::alloc_order` and refused it if it reached
past the limit. The lists are LIFO and address-blind and are seeded in
ascending order, so their front is the top of RAM: on a Pi with more than a
gibibyte, a carve for the legacy DMA engines or the VideoCore mailbox, which
reach the low gibibyte, was refused `OutOfRange` with most of that gibibyte
free, and succeeded only when fragmentation left a low block at the front.

`FrameAllocator::alloc_order_under` carves below a ceiling: it walks the
bitmap's maximal free runs downward from the ceiling a word at a time and
claims the highest aligned block below it out of the free block enclosing it,
so the carve fails only when no such block is free (`OutOfMemory`) or no usable
RAM lies below the ceiling (`OutOfRange`). Both carves use it, their post-hoc
checks and `DmaError::AddrLimitExceeded` are gone, and `dma_errno` folds the
allocator's refusal through `AllocError::as_errno`. The search costs a step
per bitmap word and per free run below the ceiling, paid only by a ceiling
inside RAM.

Regression tests: `kernel/mem`'s
`alloc_dma_carves_below_a_limit_inside_ram_whatever_the_free_lists_offer_first`
(fails on the old carve); the frame allocator's highest-block, exhaustion,
refusal and unconstrained-equivalence tests; and
`proptest_ceiling_carves_take_the_highest_free_block_or_prove_none`, which
checks every answer against a brute-force search.

## D174 — adjacent boot-map regions populated buddies that never merged — FIXED

`FrameAllocator::new` populated each usable region as its own run, so where two
regions met, the buddies either side of the seam were registered apart and —
no free ever touching them — never merged: a block spanning the seam could not
be allocated though every frame of it was free. Adjacent regions are now one
run. The invariant this restores, that every aligned all-free run lies inside
one free block, is also what lets `alloc_order_under` (D173) claim a run by
splitting its enclosing block. Regression test:
`adjacent_boot_regions_populate_as_one_run`.

## D175 — memory below a narrow DMA ceiling has no reserve against ordinary allocations (OPEN)

The frame allocator has no address zones — `MemoryClass` is accounting only —
and ordinary allocations take whichever block the LIFO lists offer, so as
memory churns they come to occupy the low gibibyte the Pi's legacy DMA engines
and mailbox reach as readily as the RAM above it. A constrained carve made late
on a busy machine, such as an audio stream opened hours after boot, can then be
refused `OutOfMemory` while gibibytes above its ceiling are free. D173 made
such a carve succeed whenever memory below its ceiling is free; nothing yet
keeps that memory free.

The fix is Linux's: zones whose boundaries come from discovery (the lowest
`Dma` ceiling any node carries, and 4 GiB where a device reaches only 32 bits),
ordinary allocations served from the highest zone first and falling into a
lower one only while it keeps a reserve, and constrained carves served from the
zones below their ceiling. The boundaries must be known when the allocator is
populated, or applied by a re-zoning pass after discovery, on every port —
which is why it is not absorbed here. Its regression test drives ordinary
allocations to exhaustion and shows a constrained carve still finds the reserve
below its ceiling.

## D176 — the userland runtime and its C stubs were outside the UB oracle — FIXED

`lib/rt` — the process global allocator, the thread runtime, every syscall
wrapper — and `lib/abi-sys` carry hand-written `unsafe` but were not in
`tools/xtask/src/commands/miri.rs`'s `TARGETS`, so no gate interpreted them.
Run by hand under `-Zmiri-strict-provenance`, three findings kept them out:

- **The heap synthesised its pointers from bare integers.** `Heap`'s
  `GlobalAlloc` glue cast each arena address with `as *mut u8`, which the
  interpreter cannot follow. The page source now names the memory it made
  (`Pager::pointer`): the syscall pager with `with_exposed_provenance_mut`,
  because the kernel maps the arena outside the abstract machine, and the
  test pagers with `without_provenance_mut`, because their arena is
  addresses alone and never dereferenced.
- **Four thread tests lost the rendezvous cells they acquired**, which miri
  reports as leaks, and `a_refused_spawn_returns_its_cell_and_frees_its_payload`
  passed only because they did: it expected the free list to grow, which holds
  only when it started empty. Every test now returns its cells, and the
  refused-spawn test seeds the cell the spawn must take and give back.
- **Two C-stub tests built fake entry addresses by casting integers**; they
  are `without_provenance_mut` addresses now, the stub reading only the value.

Both crates are enrolled, `tairix-rt` dealt across the host's cores. The
regression guard is the stage itself: each finding aborts it.

## D177 — the I²C controller driver logged without the log capability — FIXED

`drivers/bus/i2c/bcm2835` records each child endpoint it binds or fails to
serve through `tairix_rt::LogSink`, but its signed manifest requested only its
register window, interrupt and privileged bind, and the kernel refuses
`log_emit` without `CAP_LOG_EMIT`: every record was dropped. The driver now
declares one `REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES` set, which both its runtime and the image
builder read, carrying `LOG_EMIT`. Of the other twenty-three driver bundles,
none that logs lacked it. Regression test:
`the_manifest_requests_the_log_its_records_go_to`.

## D178 — a DMA window starting at bus address 0 read as untranslated — FIXED

A `Dma` resource meant one of two things, told apart only by
`translated_base() != 0`: a plain addressing limit (`dma(limit, max_len)`,
the length being the largest buffer) or a translated `dma-ranges` window
(`dma_translated(top, extent, bus)`). Discovery emits every window with
`dma_translated`, so a window mapping bus `0` onto a non-zero CPU base read as
a plain limit: `translate_device_addr` handed back the CPU address as the
device address, and neither the window's floor nor its extent was enforced.
No pinned tree has such a window, but any SoC whose devices see RAM from bus
`0` does.

A translated window now carries `HwResource::DMA_TRANSLATED` in its flags
(`TAIRIX_HW_RES_FLAG_DMA_TRANSLATED` in the C view), `DmaConstraint` records
it, and translation keys on it; `lspci` renders the bus side on the same test.
Regression test:
`translate_device_addr_rebases_a_window_whose_bus_side_starts_at_zero`.

## D179 — a store answer adopted mid-drag snapped the terminal's settings sheet back — FIXED

`Publication::adopt` made a write's answer the live profile outright and every
open sheet was then rebuilt from it, so the answer to one settle landing during
the next drag reset that slider under the pointer, and a release before the
pointer moved again settled on the reset value. Four more ways the same path
lost an edit are closed with it:

- **An answer applies only where the user is not editing.** `Publication`
  records the settings each edit touched (`ProfileKeys`, over the registry's
  typed `Profile::set_from`/`differing`) until a save carries them; the answer
  — or on a refusal the last profile the store held — replaces every other
  setting. A policy or a restore still wins there, and a setting dragged back
  onto its written value is still the user's.
- **One write is outstanding at a time.** `JobDesk` drops a superseded answer
  only if a newer job is already waiting when it is delivered, so an answer
  collected after the next submission was adopted as current, and its
  latest-wins replacement let a later save displace a waiting restore or write
  the pre-restore values back over it. A settle or restore asked for meanwhile
  is owed and handed out when the answer lands, restore first.
- **An edit applies only what it changed** (`Publication::edit(was, now)`), so
  a sheet whose copy fell behind — another window's, or one open while the menu
  changed the size — cannot put stale values back.
- **A re-seeded sheet keeps the interaction.** `Settings::adopt` rebuilt the
  swatch grid, moving the selected well, and the channel sliders editing it,
  back to the background under a press. It takes the colours in place
  (`SwatchGrid::adopt_scheme`) and reports the rows whose value moved rather
  than invalidating the sheet.

## D146 — a CPU fault in a minimal QEMU integration kernel was a silent hang — FIXED

The minimal test kernels define their own `kernel_main` and never armed a
trap table: on aarch64 `VBAR_EL1` stayed 0, so a fault vectored to `0x200`,
executed zeros as `UDF` and re-faulted forever; riscv64 trapped through
whatever `stvec` the firmware left; x86_64 had no IDT, so the first exception
triple-faulted and QEMU exited with status 0 and nothing on serial. Even with
vectors armed, a fatal exception with no fault handler parked the CPU without
a word, and the harness could only kill the guest on its inactivity budget.

- **Every port arms its trap table in its boot entry**, before
  `kernel_main`: `init_vectors` on aarch64, `install_trap_vector` on
  riscv64, and on x86_64 boot descriptor tables
  (`percpu::install_boot_tables`) that route every vector to the fatal tail
  and give `#DF` an IST stack of its own; the kernel replaces them with its
  per-CPU tables. The test-only legacy `idt.rs` and its `static mut` are
  deleted, and its two consumers observe faults through the fault slot.
- **A fatal exception no handler claims is reported.** Each port's fatal
  tail, and x86_64's `#PF` entry, which exited through QEMU's debug port,
  writes the port's own report (`tairix_arch_api::fatal`): a banner naming
  the port's registers, then the `4011` record with the processor,
  `syndrome`, `fault_addr`, `fault_pc`, `fault_sp` and the boot-stack
  guard's verdict. The ports' `handle_panic_via_serial` ends on the `4010`
  record the same way. The two records, `KernelFault`, the record's hex
  spelling and the fatal latch have one definition there, which
  `kernel_core`'s audit ids and post-mortem read.
- **The harness ends a run on the record** (`tairix_qemu::Outcome::Fatal`):
  the serial drain watches each completed line, and the run ends the moment
  one lands. An enrolment may expect it (`Expect::Fatal` with the fields the
  record must name).

Regression tests: `fatal_fault_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,x86_64}` and
`fatal_double_fault_qemu_x86_64` fault with no handler installed and pass
only on a record naming their syndrome — aarch64 the defect's own
`ESR 0x86000000` at `0x3ff0000000000000`; without the boot-entry install
aarch64 and riscv64 fail on their budgets and x86_64 on a silent exit. Host
tests pin the record (`tairix_arch_api::fatal`), the runner's watch and
outcome (`tairix_qemu`), the enrolment verdict (`qemu_tests::fatal_verdict`)
and the boot tables' IST mapping.

## D225 — the DMA quarantine rested on premises the kernel did not enforce — FIXED

D167's release and retirement proofs assumed facts the kernel now enforces, and
recording a surrendered block no longer allocates.

- **One live driver per node.** `AddressSpaceRegistry::admit_driver` refuses a
  second load for a node whose driver still has a thread running
  (`Errno::Busy`); `node_drivers` indexes each node's live driver. Admission
  claims the node before any other state of the child exists, so a refusal
  (`AdmitError::NodeBusy`) leaves only the parked task, and every later
  admission failure withdraws what the child was given, the claim included. An
  exit is recorded only once the process's last thread is down, and the claim
  is released just before it (`land_thread_down`, `retire_loading_child`), so
  a successor loaded on seeing the exit is admitted rather than refused.
  `dma_quiesced` therefore frees only what instances whose last thread is down
  carved.
- **A node id names one device for the boot.** `HwTreeStore` is seeded once,
  before anything publishes into it, and has no `append`; ids come from a
  high-water mark that seeding and publishing only raise, `publish_child`
  refuses with `NoSpace` once the id space is spent, the inventory is kept in
  id order, and a child is never published under a node the tree no longer
  holds.
- **A removal settles the node's custody.** A surprise removal retires the node
  for good (`Standing::Gone`): what is held frees now, what arrives later frees
  on arrival. An orderly removal detaches it (`Standing::Detached`): no carve is
  taken for it again, and what it holds stays until a reset by a driver of the
  node. Custody is opened only for a node the tree holds, asked under the lock
  a removal takes, so a driver admitted just before its device vanished cannot
  open a record the removal never saw (`DmaError::DeviceGone`, surfaced as
  `DeviceOffline`).
- **A removal revokes the node's authority** from its live driver and from
  whatever it delegated to, and a driver admitted during the removal is either
  refused or revoked (D230), so no task reaches a removed device while its
  quarantine reasons about it.
- **A bus driver keeps its children across its own reset.** The xHCI driver
  matches each interface node by device identity to the index now serving its
  device after a controller reset (`interfaces::Interfaces::reconcile`),
  serial number included, so a device that came back keeps its node, buffer
  and driver even at another index, while one swapped for another of its model
  is replaced,
  and the device manager's recovery hold, which kept a vanished child's driver
  bound while its owner recovered, is deleted: a vanished child's driver is
  unloaded at once.
- **A surrender never allocates.** `DmaCustody` is `reserve` / `unreserve` /
  `hold`: every carve and every DMA shared region reserves room for its own
  surrender, a live free returns it, and `hold` records into that room.

## D226 — live drivers freed DMA memory their device could still own — FIXED

A driver frees DMA memory only once its device can no longer reach it, and
withholds whatever it cannot prove released: `DmaSlab::withhold` makes a slab's
drop free nothing, leaving the region for the quarantine when the driver exits.

- **Every DMA-owning device type has a teardown guard.** `VirtioBlk`,
  `VirtioCrypto`, `VirtioNet`, `VirtioInput` and `VirtioSnd` reset the device
  when dropped and withhold their rings and staging if the reset does not
  confirm; their `close` methods are gone. `Genet` stops its DMA engines when
  dropped, once it has started them over its frames, telling each to stop
  whatever the other does. `UsbDevice` resets its
  controller and withholds every chunk (`DmaBank::withhold_all`) if it will not
  reset. `Emmc2` withholds its staging from a controller whose line reset never
  confirmed. Every early return of `lib/netchan` and `lib/audiochan` `serve`,
  `virtio_kbd` and the xHCI main is covered by these.
- **A slot's memory follows the Disable Slot outcome.** `lib/usb`'s
  `disable_slot_best_effort` reports whether the controller confirmed;
  `detach_device`, `detach_hub` and a failed attach release a slot's chunks —
  composite siblings' included — only then, and otherwise withhold them
  (`DmaBank::withhold`) and keep its DCBAA entry, the local bookkeeping still
  freed so a re-plug enumerates. The detaches unroute a slot's entries before
  Disable Slot, so nothing arms or rings the slot being disabled; an attach
  that serves nothing is refused before it is configured and takes the same
  path; and a failed attach is re-driven only on a slot confirmed disabled. A
  Disable Slot confirmed after the wait returns them then, the DCBAA entry
  cleared first (`settle_awaited_disable`, `DmaBank::release_withheld_chunk`),
  so repeated unplugs behind a hub withhold nothing for long, and a confirmed
  controller reset releases every chunk still withheld (`release_withheld`). A `start` that fails once the controller may run
  resets it before the bank drops, and withholds the bank if it will not
  reset.
- **An unanswered mailbox request keeps its buffer.** The service's property
  buffer is owned by a `DmaMailbox`, which withholds it when dropped while
  `MmioMailbox::request_outstanding` reports a posted request whose reply was
  never read, so every exit of the service keeps a buffer the firmware still
  owes a reply. It refuses a buffer that is not word-aligned or needs cache
  maintenance, which its window could not soundly or coherently address.
- **`virtio_snd` never frees a period the device holds.** Only an acknowledged
  `PCM_RELEASE` promises every transfer complete, so release and reconfigure
  collect the returned transfers before letting the periods go, and a period the
  device still holds is lent into its transfer queue's per-head record
  (`TransferQueue`), carved at bring-up so the lend never allocates, until its
  completion arrives. A completion on the transfer queue a direction's streams
  share goes to whichever stream posted it, so a second stream of a direction,
  or a stream reconfigured after release, is not failed by a completion another
  posted. The queue is sized at bring-up for every period all the device's
  streams keep in flight, and a device whose queue cannot hold them is refused
  then; a period is filled from the mixer's ring only when its queue has room
  to post it, and the event pool posts only what the negotiated ring holds.
- **A posted transmit pair is never dropped.** `TxStaging::record_inflight`
  withholds a pair it has no slot for rather than dropping it, and a withheld
  `BounceBuffer` is not scrubbed either, since the device may still be reading
  it.

Before `DRIVER_OK` a conformant virtio device reaches no ring, so a bring-up
failure there still drops what it carved, as D167 left it.

## D227 — request drivers took any completion as the current request's once a chain was abandoned — FIXED

A request the device leaves unanswered is failed to its caller, but its chain
and every buffer it names stay the device's until the device hands them back:
nothing is published over them, and no completion is attributed to a chain it
does not belong to.

- **The queue attributes completions.** `SplitQueue` keeps its free list and
  chain links in driver memory and accepts a completion only for the head of a
  chain it holds; a head outside the table, a free or interior descriptor is
  refused (`MalformedCompletion`) and reclaims nothing, and a device writing
  over the descriptor table cannot reach the free list. Descriptors are
  reissued oldest-returned first, so a completion the device repeats for a
  chain it returned names free descriptors, and is refused, for as long as
  the ring allows. A queue that cannot hold the descriptors its driver keeps
  on it is refused (`QueueTooShallow`) before any ring is handed over.
- **One request at a time, once.** `tairix_virtio::RequestQueue` is the one
  submit-and-wait for virtio-blk, virtio-crypto and the virtio-sound and
  virtio-net control queues, replacing their per-driver loops (virtio-net's
  spun on the ring without parking): a chain it gives up on stays abandoned
  until `settle` sees it come back, notifying the device again meanwhile at
  most once per the request's budget, and until then nothing is published and
  every request fails `DeviceOffline`.
  Nothing is published over a completion already in the ring, which with no
  chain out answers nothing. A request waits at most its budget in all, each
  wait given what is left of it on the host's clock (`VirtioHost::now_ns`),
  so a device that keeps waking the driver cannot stretch it, and a storm of
  wakes ends sooner at `MAX_COMPLETION_WAKES`. A wait that times out, or that
  the host could not make at all, ends the request `DeviceOffline` once the
  ring has been read again.
- **A completion that answered nothing is refused.** Every virtio driver
  stages a status no device writes into each reply before publishing —
  virtio-blk's status byte, virtio-crypto's session reply and statuses,
  virtio-sound's period status — so a completion that wrote no reply is
  refused rather than read as the previous request's `OK`. A payload in reused
  staging (virtio-blk read data, virtio-crypto job output) is taken only when
  the completion's written length covers it and the status behind it, and an
  event slot is zeroed before it is reposted.
- **Bounded drains.** A bulk drain takes at most a ring's worth of
  completions per call — virtio-net per `service` from each queue (a receive
  pass also finishing a merged frame begun inside that bound), and the
  virtio-sound and virtio-input event queues per drain — however far the
  device claims to have got or however fast it refills what is reposted.
- **Staging the device holds is neither reused nor scrubbed under it.**
  `BounceBuffer::into_slab_after` hands an abandoned request's buffers back
  unscrubbed — a scrub could overwrite a payload the device has yet to read, and
  a write it has yet to make lands after it — and the driver scrubs a sensitive
  payload once the device returns it or a confirmed reset takes it back when
  the driver is dropped. virtio-crypto settles both queues before
  any job, since they share staging, and destroys a session an abandoned or
  refused create, job or destroy left before the next job runs; a destroy
  answered "no such session" has done its job, and a device that will not let
  a session go gets no further key.
- **The same rule beyond virtio.** The mailbox waits for an unanswered
  request's reply before it stages or posts another (`TimeoutStage::Unanswered`),
  that wait and the request's own each given a whole allowance, and the aarch64
  boot path holds its whole firmware conversation on one transport, so that
  wait spans it. xHCI stages each device's control
  transfers through that device's own region, so a transfer left armed after a
  timeout can only write its own device's buffer. EMMC2 resets its command and
  data lines after any failed transfer, DMA or PIO, before another stages into
  its region, and aborts a multi-block one with `CMD12`; if the reset never
  confirms it refuses every later DMA transfer. A recovery that cannot prove
  the card back in `tran` (no abort sent, or one unanswered) makes the next
  data command ask the card's state first (`CMD13`): a card still sending or
  receiving is aborted and asked again, one still programming is awaited on
  its busy interrupt, and any other state, or a lock, fails closed and is asked
  again next time. A healthy card is never asked.

## D230 — a removed node's grants outlived it — FIXED

A node's removal left every grant its admission minted with the driver loaded
for it, and with whatever that driver had delegated them to, until the device
manager unloaded it. A driver still running kept its windows onto the vanished
device's registers and its interrupt bindings, and a URB transport the HCD
republished for a replacing device served the old driver's submits and let it
read the new device's buffer (`plans/USB.md` U10).

- **A grant records the device it reaches.** Each grant carries an origin: the
  node a driver was admitted for (`mint_node_grant`), the node whose device an
  `msi_alloc` vector serves, or none for a region or endpoint its holder made.
  A delegation (`delegate_grant`, behind `shm_grant`, `shm_grant_peer` and
  `call_grant`) inherits the covering grant's origin, checking and minting
  under one lock, and `hw_emit_node` covers a child's resources only from
  grants whose origin is the emitter's own node or none
  (`grant_covers_for_child`), so a child's driver never holds authority
  another device's removal would not reach.
- **Removal revokes, then tears down the reach into the device.**
  `hw_remove_node`, in either posture, revokes every grant whose origin is a
  removed node, in every task, at once (`revoke_node_grants`); a revoked grant
  authorises nothing and stays flagged only until its holder's teardown
  finishes (`kernel/core/src/revoke.rs`). The walk releases the holder's
  bindings of the nodes' lines — a parked `irq_wait` returns `NotFound`, a wait
  set holding one fails `NotFound`, and a wait never re-arms a released line —
  and unmaps its windows onto the nodes' registers (`MmioWindowMap::retain`),
  reaching its space through the registry's weak live-space record and
  dropping the pages from its snapshot. Every CPU stops translating each page
  (`CrossCpuTlbShootdown`, wired per port through
  `KernelArch::cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown`) before the removal returns. Walks are
  serialised, so each finds only the grants it revoked. Audited
  `HW_NODE_GRANTS_REVOKED` (4093).
- **Shared RAM is retired, not pulled.** A region conferred through a removed
  node stays mapped wherever it is mapped, so no holder is killed, or handed
  fabricated contents in place of a reply that already landed, for a device
  going away (the RAID composer keeps its member windows through a pulled
  disk). The region is retired (`sharedreg::retire`): it takes no new
  `shm_map` or kernel hold, `shm_grant` and `shm_grant_peer` refuse it, and
  `hw_emit_node` refuses a child carrying it, all `PermissionDenied`, so it can
  never carry another device's data and a server gives each node it publishes
  a fresh region. Only a region a node still in the tree also confers
  (`region_conferred_live`: a transport a parent republished on the removed
  child) outlives the removed session; there each revoked holder's mappings are
  withdrawn under its space's lock, shot down before the region's frames can
  be freed, and the holder is killed, since its pointers into the region could
  alias whatever is mapped there next. A holder whose access cannot be torn
  down is killed too, and only while its live space is the one the walk found,
  so a recycled id is never signalled.
- **No interleaving leaves authority standing.** Tree removal precedes
  revocation, admission checks the tree after it mints
  (`AdmitError::NodeGone`), and so does `msi_alloc`, so a driver admitted or a
  vector allocated during a removal is refused or revoked; `mmio_map`,
  `shm_map` and `irq_bind` re-check their grant after the operation and undo
  exactly what they made; a port access runs under the grant it was checked
  against. A dying driver's lines, endpoints and regions are released before
  its node claim, so a successor loaded as its exit is observed finds none of
  them held.
- **Outside it.** Calls a holder posted before the revocation stay queued for
  their server, which drains a transport before it publishes a new node on it;
  DMA carves are the holder's own memory and reach the quarantine at its exit
  (D167; an orderly removal's carves stay there for the boot, D241).

## D231 — `irq_bind` bound any line to any holder of `CAP_IRQ_BIND` — FIXED

`irq_bind` took a raw line number and checked only the capability, so a driver
could bind an interrupt line its node never requested — another device's,
first come — and a driver whose binding had been revoked could bind the line
again. A line is now bound only while a live grant of the caller names it
(`AddressSpaceRegistry::holds_irq_line`); any other is `PermissionDenied`.
Regression test: `irq_bind_refuses_a_line_the_caller_holds_no_grant_for`.

## D232 — a shared region's reference was released after a teardown that failed part-way — FIXED

`sharedreg::unmap` released the mapping's reference whatever the facility's
unmap returned, so an unmap that failed after tearing down some of a region's
pages could free its frames under the entries left behind. `unmap_with` now
releases the reference only once the entries are gone, or none was found
(`NotFound`), and otherwise keeps the region allocated. Regression tests:
`a_teardown_that_failed_keeps_the_region_allocated` and
`a_teardown_that_found_nothing_mapped_releases_the_reference`.

## D233 — an enumeration retry replayed the requests its failed attempt left on the old EP0 ring — FIXED

After a transaction error on a descriptor read the xHCI engine re-drove the
device on the EP0 ring the aborted attempt had used, so the newly addressed
slot started at the ring base and replayed the abandoned requests, and the
retry failed; and a retry after Address Device had succeeded could never
succeed on real hardware, since the device held its new address and ignored a
fresh slot's `SET_ADDRESS`. Each retry now resets the port first, returning
the device to Default state, then binds EP0 to a fresh ring (`bind_control`).
Regression tests:
`a_transaction_fault_on_a_descriptor_read_re_drives_the_device_on_a_fresh_ep0_ring`,
which asserts the port reset, and
`a_transaction_fault_on_a_descriptor_read_behind_a_hub_re_drives_after_a_port_reset`,
over a mock that now models device addresses.

## D234 — a user-space unmap on x86_64 or riscv64 invalidated only the calling CPU — FIXED

Every path that gives a user frame up clears the entries, shuts every view that
can still reach the frame, and only then zeroes and frees it
(`kernel/mem::retire`; `docs/src/architecture/memory.md`, *Releasing what an
unmap cleared*):

- **The CPUs.** A space's `ActiveCpus` names the CPUs it is the active root of:
  the dispatcher enters a CPU before the switch-in hook loads the root, fenced,
  and removes it once the park hook reports it left the root. No port tags TLB
  entries with an address-space id and each flushes the outgoing regime on a
  root switch, so the set is exact and a single-threaded process's unmaps reach
  no other CPU. The remote half is the new HAL method
  `CrossCpuTlbShootdown::shootdown_user_range(CpuMask, …)`: x86_64 IPIs those
  LAPICs alone (`tlb_shootdown::shootdown_remote`, reloading `CR3` past 33
  pages), riscv64 folds their harts into one RFENCE call per window (D281), and
  aarch64 owes nothing because its local flush is already `tlbi vaae1is`. The
  space holds its reach (`SpaceTlb`) from construction, through
  `spawn_layout::process_space`, so no helper that unmaps through it — anonymous,
  file, DMA, device and shared windows, compress-out, the unwind of a partial
  map — can skip the shootdown. The revocation path (D230) now relies on it
  instead of its own all-CPU shootdown, which is gone.
- **The snapshot.** The release takes the `Retire` view the pages must leave;
  `kernel/core`'s `SnapshotRetire` drops them under the registry's write lock.
  Doing so *before* any frame is freed is D278.
- **Batching.** `Retiring` holds up to 64 frames, so one remote shootdown and one
  snapshot write-lock cover the batch.

The two-user-thread vertical the defect named is still not writable: no
x86_64 or riscv64 image runs user threads on more than one CPU, and no SMP
user-program chassis exists (the D103 gap). The targeted shootdown itself is
driven on live secondaries by the `cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown_qemu_x86_64` and
`_riscv64` verticals; the ordering is pinned on the host by the
`live::tests::views` and `retire::tests` suites.

## D235 — a control transfer that did not complete left the device's EP0 unusable — FIXED

`complete_control_transfer` recovered the control endpoint only from a STALL:
a transfer that timed out was left armed, and one that ended in babble or a
transaction, split, buffer or TRB error left EP0 halted with its TRBs counted
in flight, so the device's later control transfers queued behind it until it
was re-plugged. The serial-number read (D226's identity) made this reachable
during enumeration, failing the attach of a device that never answered a
string request. Every control transfer that does not complete now has EP0
taken back before its error returns — Reset Endpoint for a halt, Stop
Endpoint for a timeout, each falling back to the other on a Context State
Error, then Set TR Dequeue onto a rebuilt ring, with the abandoned transfer's
late events drained — and an endpoint that cannot be recovered refuses
further transfers rather than overwrite what the controller may still own.
The serial is read only for a storage device, and any fault on it costs only
the serial. Regression tests:

`a_late_control_transfer_cannot_alter_another_devices_transfer_data`.

## D236 — the charter-citation strip left broken sentences behind — FIXED

Removing a citation left three kinds of residue: a parenthetical opening on a
colon (`(§4: deterministic OOM …)` became `(: deterministic OOM …)`), a
semicolon running into the dash that introduced a gloss (`(fail closed; §5.4 —
no fallback)` became `(fail closed; — no fallback)`), and a sentence opening on
that dash (`… call site. §2.10 — every `#[allow]` …` became `… call site. —
every …`), and in four module docs a quotation of the rule the citation had
named. Every such sentence across the kernel, `lib/*`, the drivers, `xtask` and
the QEMU fixtures now reads as prose, a restated rule dropped where it carried
no reason of its own, and `charter-cite` refuses all three forms, so the residue
cannot come back. Regression tests:
`a_parenthetical_whose_citation_was_stripped_is_refused` and the workspace
scan `workspace_carries_no_charter_citations`.

## D237 — the EMMC2 bring-up re-polled `ACMD41` back to back — FIXED

Bring-up repeated `CMD55` + `ACMD41` until the card reported power-up, up to
a million rounds with no interval, where the SD Physical Layer specification
expects a paced retry within one second. It now polls every 10 ms for at most
100 rounds through the `SdhciHost::delay_us` timed wait, which the in-kernel
host implements as a timer park (`tairix_kernel_core::park_until`).
Regression tests: `power_up_polling_is_paced_one_interval_apart` and
`a_card_that_never_powers_up_fails_after_the_specifications_second`.

## D238 — a configuration's stray descriptors were taken as real interfaces and endpoints — FIXED

`InterfaceInfo::decode_all` accepted an endpoint descriptor for endpoint 0, an
endpoint named twice in one configuration, and a second default setting of an
interface number already taken, so a device's garbled configuration could make
the engine program endpoint 0 as a data endpoint or bind one endpoint to two
drivers. Each is now skipped, as Linux does, the used interface numbers and
endpoint slots tracked in `lib/inline`'s `BitSet256`. Regression tests:
`an_endpoint_descriptor_for_endpoint_zero_is_skipped`,
`an_endpoint_named_twice_in_one_configuration_is_skipped`,
`a_second_default_setting_of_one_interface_number_is_skipped_with_its_endpoints`
and the `fuzz_descriptors` harness, whose model expects the same.

## D239 — the HID report parser misread hostile and unusual descriptors — FIXED

The first fuzz harness over `lib/hid` (`fuzz_hid_report`) found nine: a long
item was skipped one byte short, and one cut off by the descriptor's end was
accepted; a mouse's fields could be read from another report, so a click
fabricated motion; re-entering a Report ID restarted its bit offset, so fields
overlapped; Pop did not restore the Report ID; a map with a field the boot
layout cannot read was accepted and then dropped every report rather than
falling back to boot protocol; a modifier field narrower than a byte fabricated
modifiers from its neighbours; a huge Report Count stalled enumeration in the
axis search; the boot keyboard released a key listed in two slots twice; and a
modifier usage in the key array pressed the modifier beside the bitmap.
Regression tests: `a_long_item_is_skipped_whole`,
`a_field_of_another_report_is_never_read_from_this_ones`,
`a_report_s_fields_continue_where_its_last_item_left_off`,

`keyboard_duplicate_usage_releases_once` and
`keyboard_modifier_usages_in_the_key_array_leave_the_bitmap_in_charge`, with
the harness itself.

## D240 — a RAID member offered its window's region id where the composer needed its handle — FIXED

The member agent delegated its transport window to the composer and then sent
the region id, discarding the handle `shm_grant` returned; the composer mapped
that number as one of its own grant handles, so it mapped whichever of its
grants had it (another member's window or its own array window) or none. The
offer carries the composer's handle (`MemberOffer::window_grant`), and the
composer recognises a window it already holds by that handle. Regression
tests: `the_composer_maps_exactly_the_window_the_agent_delegated`,
`a_region_id_that_names_another_of_the_composers_grants_is_never_mapped`,
`a_refused_delegation_is_reported_rather_than_offered` and
`a_held_window_is_recognised_by_the_handle_the_offer_names`.

## D241 — an orderly removal leaves its driver's DMA memory quarantined for the boot (OPEN)

`hw_remove_node` revokes the node's grants before its driver is told, so a
driver of an orderly-removed node can neither quiesce its still-present device
(its register windows are gone) nor `dma_free` a carve (its DMA grant is gone);
the carves reach the quarantine at its exit as `Detached`, which only a reset by
a driver of that node releases, and none can be admitted for a removed node.
No current code orderly-removes a node whose driver holds DMA (the RAID
composer's array nodes hold none). Not absorbed: the fix is an orderly-removal
protocol that stops the node's driver before revoking, or a bus-level quiesce
the parent attests (PCIe bus-master disable) that releases the node's
quarantine. Its regression test is an orderly removal of a DMA-holding node
whose carves return to the allocator once the device is proven quiet.

## D242 — the kernel binary keeps `static mut` state (OPEN)

Each port's `main.rs` backs the boot heap with `static mut HEAP`, and the
x86_64 boot path keeps its per-CPU boot stacks in `static mut KERNEL_STACKS`;
the charter forbids `static mut` outright. The QEMU verticals back their boot
heaps the same way — 162 `static mut HEAP`s under `tests/integration/` — so
the fix covers them too. Not absorbed: the fix places both
in memory the linker reserves and hands their bounds to the allocator and the
bring-up, so no Rust static is mutable, across all three ports at once. Its
regression check is a workspace scan refusing `static mut`.

## D243 — the device manager never learns that a driver died (OPEN)

`devmgr` wakes only on `hw_tree_wait`, and reloads only for node ids it has
not seen, so a driver that crashes, or exits stating its reason (the xHCI HCD
failing its controller closed, exit 85, or losing its wait-set, 86), leaves
its device undriven for the boot, and a load refused `Busy` while a
predecessor's teardown is deferred is never retried. A reloaded HCD would also
inherit its controller node's recorded `Offline` health unless it publishes
`Healthy` at bring-up. Not absorbed: the driver store's load reply must carry the driver's
process instance (`ProcId`) for `PEER_WATCH`, and `devmgr` must wait on the
tree and its drivers' exits at once (a tree-generation wait-set source).
Its regression test is a driver that exits unasked being reloaded for its
still-present node.

## D244 — MSI vectors are never freed (OPEN)

`MsiAllocFacility` has no release, so a vector allocated for a driver stays
allocated after the driver exits or its device is removed, and repeated
reloads exhaust the vector space. Not absorbed: each port's producer needs a
free, driven by the driver's exit reclaim and by the revocation of the
vector's grant. Its regression test is allocate-exit-allocate cycling beyond
the vector space.

## D245 — a re-plugged NIC or audio device can be handed no channel (OPEN)

The device manager's network and audio binders never forget a channel
endpoint they handed over, and a NIC driver takes the first free endpoint id,
so a re-plugged device that reuses one is never handed to its service. Not
absorbed: interface retirement in `netstack` and `audiod`, which the binders
then drive on removal. Its regression test is unplug and replug of one NIC.

## D246 — writable-root configuration is not re-read after the root unlocks (OPEN)

`netcfg` re-reads `network.conf` and `system.conf` only on a tree-generation
bump, and nothing bumps after the encrypted root is unlocked, so configuration
on the writable root may never be delivered. Not absorbed: the unlock must
publish an event `devmgr` waits on. Its regression test is a configuration
that exists only on the unlocked root reaching `netstack`.

## D247 — the ports disagree on a partial boot hardware tree (OPEN)

On a malformed discovery walk aarch64 records no tree, while riscv64 and
x86_64 seed the nodes they collected before the fault. Not absorbed: one rule
for all three, decided and shared through the arch-neutral seeding path. Its
regression test is a malformed walk treated alike on every port.

## D248 — the virtio test doubles were compiled into every production build — FIXED

`MockHost` and `MockTransport` were built unconditionally and re-exported by
`drivers/bus/virtio`, which all three kernels link. They are now behind
`lib/virtio`'s `mock` feature, enabled only from dev-dependencies, the mock
peer's ring views gated with them, and the re-export is gone. The freestanding
kernel builds are the regression check: they compile `lib/virtio` without the
feature, so any mock item outside the gate fails them. The bus crate's
register-window backends, which nothing constructed once the transports moved
to `lib/virtio`, are deleted, and the crate re-exports only the two transports.

## D249 — the mailbox service busy-spun its reply waits — FIXED

The user-space mailbox service spun on the doorbell's status register for each
reply, up to ten million reads (about four seconds of a core on metal), though
the mailbox raises an interrupt, and a wait's reads were bounded by the square
of its budget. The service now binds the discovered inbox interrupt (the
bundle requests `CAP_IRQ_BIND`; a service that cannot bind it exits), turns it
on, and parks each reply wait on it until a deadline of its own; the pre-MMU
boot path keeps its bounded spin, one budget of looks per wait. Regression
tests: `an_owned_mailboxs_reply_wait_parks_until_the_inbox_interrupt_fires`,
`each_reply_wait_of_an_owned_mailbox_has_a_deadline_of_its_own`,
`an_owned_mailboxs_wait_ends_at_its_deadline_however_the_inbox_floods`,
`a_park_the_kernel_refuses_ends_the_owned_mailboxs_wait_at_once`,
`the_owned_mailbox_turns_the_inbox_interrupt_on_and_the_boot_transport_leaves_it_off`
and `a_spinning_wait_takes_one_budget_of_looks_however_the_inbox_chatters`.

## D250 — virtio-net freed its receive buffers unscrubbed at teardown — FIXED

The receive pool and the merged-frame reassembly buffer went back to the
allocator unscrubbed when the driver was dropped, though a ring could carry
sensitive traffic and its class is known only per service call. Once a reset
confirms, `Drop` now scrubs every receive queue's whole pool and its
reassembly buffer through the one `tairix_virtio::scrub`; a device that will
not reset keeps everything withheld and nothing scrubbed. Regression tests:
`a_frame_the_device_left_in_the_receive_pool_is_scrubbed_when_the_driver_is_dropped`
and `a_merged_frame_is_scrubbed_from_the_reassembly_buffer_when_the_driver_is_dropped`,
over the mock's `released_zeroed` record
(`a_released_slab_reports_whether_it_came_back_zeroed`).

## D251 — the virtio mock host handed out pointers its own leak had invalidated — FIXED

`MockHost` exposed a slab pointer taken before `Box::leak`, which the leak
invalidates, so every mock device's address-based ring access in every virtio
driver's tests was undefined behaviour Miri reports. It now exposes the pointer
the slab keeps after the leak; nothing changes at runtime. Two virtio-net tests
that bound frame rings over byte-aligned `Vec<u8>` now use the aligned-buffer
helpers. Regression check: the virtio suites pass under Miri with permissive
provenance (D252 is why no gate stage runs them).

## D252 — no oracle can interpret the virtio drivers' tests (OPEN)

The virtio mock peer reaches the driver's rings through the physical addresses
the driver planted, an integer-to-pointer design Miri's strict-provenance mode
(the `miri` stage) refuses outright, so the drivers' unsafe-adjacent paths
(ring views, bounce buffers, the scrub) have no enrolled undefined-behaviour
oracle. Not absorbed: the mock needs a provenance-carrying handle from slab to
peer (the peer resolving an address through the host's slab table instead of
casting it), after which `lib/virtio` and its consumers enrol. Its regression
check is those suites enrolled in `cargo xtask miri`.

## D253 — a device a controller reset moved to another index lost its node — FIXED

The xHCI HCD reconciled its interface nodes against the re-enumerated table
index by index, but a reset re-enumerates in port-walk order, so a device a
hole or an out-of-order hot-plug had placed elsewhere came back at another
index and was retracted and republished: its class driver unloaded and its
mounted filesystem surprise-removed. An allocation failure also skipped the
whole pass, leaving nodes published over indices that now served other
devices. Nodes now live on transport slots and follow their device's identity
to the index serving it (`interfaces::Interfaces::reconcile`), with no two
claiming one index, and the matching allocates nothing. Regression tests:
`a_device_a_reset_moved_to_another_index_keeps_its_node_and_buffer`,
`devices_a_reset_reordered_keep_their_nodes`,
`a_moving_node_never_takes_an_index_another_node_serves` and
`every_node_is_decided_even_when_nothing_new_can_be_published`.

## D254 — a controller halted on the submit path was never recovered — FIXED

A fault detach found while serving a submitted URB dropped its "detached"
outcome, and the submit path could not start a recovery, so a controller that
latched an error there raised no further interrupt and every URB timed out.
The shared busy-drive now runs the recovery itself, on either path.
Regression test: `a_device_leaving_on_the_submit_path_recovers_the_controller_it_halted`.

## D255 — a dead xHCI controller left the HCD idling, and a lost wait-set exited clean — FIXED

A controller that failed closed was neither retried nor served, so the HCD
idled for the boot holding its DMA while its documentation promised recovery;
and a wait-set failure exited 0, as a clean completion. A controller that
misses its grace window now has every node retracted and the HCD exits with
its reason logged (85); a lost wait-set does the same (86). Regression tests:
`a_controller_that_misses_its_grace_window_retracts_every_node_and_is_never_reset_again`
and `stopping_retracts_every_node_and_answers_its_held_urb`.

## D256 — a re-plugged device's driver was handed the previous device's buffer — FIXED

The HCD reused one URB transport's shared buffer for every device at an index,
so a replacing device's class driver mapped frames still holding the previous
device's last transfer. Every node is now published with a fresh region (the
kernel retires a removed node's region, D230), and the HCD unmaps its own copy
when the node goes. Regression test:
`a_device_replugged_where_one_left_is_published_on_a_region_no_node_carried`.

## D257 — an endpoint the event loop could not watch was bound again, never served — FIXED

When binding a transport's endpoint succeeded but adding it to the wait-set
failed, every later attempt tried to bind the endpoint again, which is taken,
so the index never served again. It is now watched again, never re-bound, and
no node is published on an endpoint the loop is not watching. Regression test:
`an_endpoint_the_event_loop_could_not_watch_is_watched_again_never_bound_again`.

## D258 — any process could steer the RAID composer with a forged offer — FIXED

The rendezvous took offers from any task, naming any endpoint and window
handle, so a forger could stall the composer on its own endpoints or feed it
fabricated superblocks. `call_peer_node` (syscall 131, gated as
`call_peer_holds`) now tells a server the hardware-tree node the poster of the
call it is serving was admitted for, resolved by process instance so a
recycled pid names nothing, and the composer admits an offer only from the
driver of a `tairix,raid-member` or `tairix,raid-candidate` node whose one
declared endpoint and one shared region are exactly the offered ones, the
endpoint not its own. The rendezvous requires `CAP_SHM` to send. Regression
tests: `call_peer_node_reads_the_node_the_caller_being_served_was_admitted_for`,

## D259 — a member listing opened a second view of a window the array was using — FIXED

Listing an array's members connected a second block client over each member's
window while the array held the first: two live `&mut` views of one buffer.
Each window is now lent to one client at a time (`MemberWindow`), and a listing
reports the geometry recorded at offer time without opening a client.
Regression test: `listing_members_opens_no_client_over_any_window`.

## D260 — a re-enumerated disk could never rejoin its array — FIXED

The composer never learned that a member agent had exited, so the dead
membership stayed and the device's fresh offer was refused for good.
Memberships are now bound to the attested agent and watched: when it exits,
the member is marked departed, the array flushed and the member retired, and
the membership released; an offer that collides with one not yet ended is
deferred (`MembershipEnd::Deferred`) and made again after a pace. Regression
tests: `a_departed_member_is_taken_out_so_its_returning_disk_can_be_placed`,
`a_composer_that_cannot_take_the_device_yet_defers_it_rather_than_refusing_it`
and `a_deferred_offer_is_made_again_after_a_pace`.

## D261 — an endpoint grant names a numeric id another binding can take (OPEN)

A grant for a call endpoint names its numeric id, and destroying the endpoint
revokes the grants naming it, but a new driver may bind the same id and have
a fresh grant for it delegated to the old holder (the RAID composer, when a
member disk re-enumerates). A client the holder built for the old binding and
has not yet retired then reaches the new device. The composer narrows this to
one turn (exits are reaped first, and a departed member's client refuses all
I/O). Not absorbed: endpoint authority must be tied to one binding of an id,
by a generation carried in the id or by calls made through the grant handle.
Its regression test is a stale grant that fails against a re-created endpoint
of the same id.

## D262 — any task could grow an endpoint server's grant table — FIXED

`shm_grant` and `call_grant` minted into the grant table of any endpoint's
server without asking whether the donor may post to that endpoint, so any
holder of `CAP_SHM` or `CAP_IPC_ENDPOINT` could grow a service's table without
bound, which also made each of its grant lookups dearer. A delegation now
requires the donor to be allowed to post to the recipient endpoint (its send
capabilities and, for a grant-restricted endpoint, the per-endpoint grant),
through the same `may_post` rule `ipc_call`, `call_post` and the wait-set
share. Regression test: `a_delegation_reaches_only_a_server_the_donor_may_post_to`.

## D263 — an unplug and re-plug folded into one root-port change is taken for a glitch (OPEN)

`next_root_change` drains a connection change on a served root port that is
connected again as a glitch, without asking whether the port is still
enabled, so a device swapped fast enough that the disconnect and the connect
latch as one change keeps the old device's node until its transfers fault,
and nothing re-arms the scan to enumerate the new one. Linux's
`hub_port_connect_change` treats "connected but no longer enabled" as a
disconnect and re-enumerates. Not absorbed: the fix detaches the old
attachment and attaches the new one in the same step when the port lost its
enable, keeps a per-port rescan mark so a fault detach re-arms enumeration,
and must settle the SuperSpeed case, where link training re-enables the port
by itself; the mock must model the enable bit. Its regression test is a
folded unplug and re-plug on a root port that ends with the new device
published and the old node retracted.

## D264 — a kept node reported a slot id a controller reset reassigned — FIXED

A USB interface node's `HwNode::address` was the device's xHCI slot id, which
a reset reassigns, so a node kept across a reset could collide with a newly
published device's address or disagree with its composite sibling, and
`lsusb` groups by address. The address is now the device's bus position, its
root port above its Route String, which a reset keeps. Regression test:
`a_nodes_address_is_its_devices_position_which_a_controller_reset_keeps`.

## D265 — a storage device without a serial number was kept across a reset on model and position alone — FIXED

Two serial-less sticks of one model swapped between the same two ports during
a controller reset compared equal, so each kept the other's node, driver and
mounted filesystem. `DeviceIdentity::recognises` now demands a serial number
of a storage interface across a re-enumeration, and the HCD's post-reset
reconcile matches by it, so such a stick is retracted and republished; within
one enumeration plain equality still names the same device. Regression tests:
`a_storage_device_without_a_serial_number_is_never_recognised_after_a_reset`,
`a_device_is_recognised_by_every_fact_and_storage_by_its_serial_too`,
`a_storage_device_without_a_serial_number_is_replaced_across_a_reset` and
`a_storage_device_without_a_serial_number_keeps_its_node_across_a_hot_plug`.

## D219 — the figure-design fuzz harness never checked what an edit did — FIXED

`tests/fuzz_design` held an accepted `Species` or `Hair` edit only to a decode
round trip and a settle only to a write having happened, so an edit that did
nothing, or a write of the wrong record, passed. Its oracle now reads every
field through `design::Edit::of`: an accepted edit shows exactly the value it
set and moves no field it cannot reshape (a species its forms and swatches,
going bald the hair's colour and volume); the record a settle writes is the
one shown, and only when the store does not hold it; an answer or refusal
landing during a drag leaves the dragged fields and puts every other where
the store's record has it, handing out the owed write; and the round trips run
through every species and through going bald with every field the far end
holds at zero written on the way. Mutating the designer's forced-zero rule
fails it.

## D220 — the figure designer adopted refusals over the drag in hand and overwrote choices it should keep — FIXED

`Designer::settle` marked a record settled when its write went out, and a
refusal was undone by opening the designer again on the stored record, so an
answer arriving during the next drag threw that drag away — the D179 pattern.
The designer now keeps the choices behind the stored record and behind the
write in flight, and the fields edited since it went out: one write is out at
a time, `landed` and `refused` take the store's record only where the player
is not editing, and a settle made meanwhile is owed and handed out by the
answer. An edit to a field the record holds at zero (`identity::Spec::fixed`,
now the one statement of that rule for the decoder and the designer) can only
ask for the zero and leaves the choice beneath alone, where it used to
overwrite a beastkin's markings with a human's zero. `settle`, `landed` and
`refused` are `#[must_use]`. Regression tests:
`an_answer_landing_mid_drag_leaves_the_drag_alone`,
`a_refusal_landing_mid_drag_reverts_only_what_was_refused`,
`a_settle_while_a_write_is_out_is_owed_until_the_answer_lands`,
`a_store_answering_another_record_wins_where_the_player_is_not_editing`,
`an_answer_to_no_write_changes_nothing`,
`an_edit_to_a_field_held_at_zero_keeps_the_choice_beneath` and
`every_field_reads_back_as_the_edit_that_sets_it`.

## D221 — the figure crate kept per-species odds and the motion order in several places — FIXED

A species' odds of carrying horns or a tail lived in `plausible::carried`,
four of its five rows unread. `species::Forms` now states each optional
feature once, its forms and how often in sixteenths the species carries one —
the one number also deciding whether it may go without and whether it carries
one at all, held consistent at compile time — and the decoder, the designer
and the plausible draw all read it, the draw bit-identical. The motion order
is `motion::Kind::ALL` alone: `Kind::index` is the declaration order, `Set` and
`Clips` are built by mapping it, and the preview's states and edges are
generated from it. The art gate's worst cell meeting `MIN_REGIONS` exactly was
measured against every dye on every species' palest and darkest build: none
falls below three regions, and the grid's own least beastkin wears the one
dye of the sixteen that meets it exactly. The harness now holds every such
dye to the grid's bounds (`every_dye_stays_readable`), so the claim is gated
rather than argued; painting one dye the palest fur's colour fails it.
Regression tests: `every_table_of_motions_is_held_in_the_order_kind_lists`,
`how_often_a_species_carries_a_form_is_what_its_forms_admit`.

## D222 — the WinterSun figure plans and comments contradicted the code — FIXED

`plans/FIGURE.md` now owes `Tints` for a palette change only, as the code
does; the beastkin's "never horned" comment went with the odds it sat beside
(D221), the species now described as sometimes horned; the digest's preview
probe holds its last clip for four frames, so every clip in it outlasts its
fade as its comment says, and a compile-time assertion holds that; `AGENTS.md`,
`plans/FIGURE.md` and `plans/WINTERSUN.md` no longer home presets in the figure
crate; and measuring every shipped preset is now a WS6 deliverable rather than
a promise no item carried.

## D286 — a returning body's `Park` or `Yield` was applied over a remote park and wake — FIXED

A task's body can be parked and woken by another CPU while it unwinds — a
job-control stop and continue reaching a running child. Every policy re-read
the state and then *stored* the one the body asked for, so a wake landing
between the read and the store was overwritten: EEVDF and MLFQ applied a
`Park` over it and stranded the task for good, and all three applied a `Yield`
by queuing the task a second time, a double share until an entry was culled.
CFQ's guard covered only the `Park` case and still raced the window.

`kernel/sched/api`'s `park::settle` is the one post-body settle every policy
calls: each transition is a compare-exchange from the state it was decided on,
a lost exchange is decided again against the new state, a task found `Ready`
is left exactly as its waker queued it, and a departure from the ready set runs
under the policy's weight accounting (D288). Pinned for every policy by the
conformance suite's `a_rewake_while_the_body_ran_leaves_the_task_queued_once`
(old MLFQ and EEVDF: `Parked` where `Ready` was due; old CFQ: queued twice),
and `park.rs`'s settle tests, including one whose exchange loses to a park.

## D287 — a task moved to another CPU was queued there without a signal — FIXED

EEVDF and MLFQ re-homed a task a yield placed on the wrong class of core, and
EEVDF re-queued an overflowed task onto its home CPU, without an IPI, so an
idle destination slept in its idle wait with the task queued and nothing to
wake it. Both now signal the destination after publishing, as CFQ already
did. Pinned for every policy by the conformance suite's
`a_yield_migration_announces_the_destination` (old MLFQ and EEVDF announced
nothing), and EEVDF's `an_overflow_drain_announces_the_home_it_requeues_onto`.

## D288 — a CPU's competing weight drifted — FIXED

CFQ and EEVDF added a task's weight where it was admitted and took off
`task.weight()` where it left, reading the priority again. `sched_set_priority`
lets an unprivileged parent lower its own child, so admitting a child at
`Normal`, lowering it and letting it park leaked a unit onto the CPU for the
rest of the boot, skewing every later placement away from it and, under EEVDF,
slowing its virtual clock. A steal or yield-migration that raced a remote park
moved weight the park had already taken off: the victim lost it twice and the
stealer kept it forever.

`share::WeightLedger` records, per task, the CPU, weight and class its weight
is counted at; every change to a CPU's total goes through it, and what comes
off is what went on. A count re-reads under the ledger lock whether the task
still competes, and a park, exit or settle performs its state transition under
it, so no interleaving counts a task twice or leaves a parked one counted.
`a_reprioritised_task_takes_off_the_weight_it_was_counted_at` and
`a_stale_entry_a_steal_finds_moves_no_weight` in both CFQ and EEVDF, each
failing against the old accounting, and the ledger's own tests in `share.rs`.

## D289 — virtual time saturated `u64` within hours on a gigahertz counter — FIXED

CFQ and EEVDF counted virtual time in raw `ticks_now` units scaled by `2^20`.
x86_64's tick is the TSC, so a weight-1 task's timeline reached `u64::MAX`
after about 6 000 s of CPU, a CPU's floor within hours, after which saturating
adds pinned every task level and fairness fell to arrival order; wasm32's
nanosecond tick lasted under ten hours. The fixed point is now
`share::SCALE = 4`, the least common multiple of the band weights, which keeps
every charge exact and lasts decades at 5 GHz; EEVDF's `V` carries the
remainder of a division by the competing weight instead of needing the
resolution. `a_decade_of_a_fast_counter_does_not_saturate` (`share.rs`).

## D290 — the scheduler's intervals had no unit — FIXED

`SchedulerConfig::boost_interval_ticks` was a raw port-tick count every boot
passed as `256`: about 4 µs on aarch64, so MLFQ's anti-starvation boost — which
walks the whole task registry — fired on almost every step, promoting every
task to `High` and leaving demotion no effect. EEVDF had no way to size a
request in real time at all (D74). `SchedulerArch::quantum_ticks` is now a
required Arch HAL method: the quantum `set_preemption` arms, in the port's own
tick, `0` until calibrated — aarch64 and riscv64 their per-CPU timer interval,
x86_64 its calibrated quantum rebased onto the TSC (`Calibration::quantum_tsc`,
shared with the scheduler-stress guest), wasm32 the frame interval it measures.
The config field is `boost_interval_quanta`, defaulting to a second's worth at
the shared quantum rate, and EEVDF's request is one quantum. The Arch HAL
conformance vertical holds the quantum stable across back-to-back reads
(`suite_rejects_a_quantum_that_changes_between_reads`), and wasm32's
measurement is pinned by
`the_frame_interval_is_measured_between_consecutive_frames`. The ports' Arch HAL
conformance tests read the quantum from state the preempt suite writes, so on
aarch64, riscv64 and wasm32 they hold the preempt suite's lock (D295).

## D291 — a run-queue push allocated infallibly on the wake and yield paths — FIXED

CFQ's ready set was a `BTreeSet`, which allocates a node on a split with no way
to refuse, and EEVDF's a `Vec`; both real-time bands were `VecDeque`s grown the
same way. Memory exhaustion therefore aborted the kernel inside a wake. The
fair sets are binary heaps — neither policy removes an entry from the middle —
and every push reserves its room fallibly, answering `Err` to the caller, which
routes the task to overflow. What remains on that path is D294.

## D292 — a task that left the real-time band by a yield kept its stale virtual time — FIXED

A task's virtual time does not move while it competes in the real-time band.
One that left it by a yield rejoined the fair band at the virtual time it had
left with — under CFQ a `vruntime` from before everything the CPU ran since —
and held the CPU until it had caught up on all of it. CFQ now places every
fair enqueue at `max(front, own)`, a no-op for a task that has been running,
and EEVDF re-admits a task whose band changed while it ran with zero lag.
`a_task_back_from_realtime_rejoins_at_the_front` (`kernel/sched/cfq`), failing
without the placement.

## D293 — `SchedulerPolicy::yield_current` was dead contract surface — FIXED

The call re-enqueued a running task and cleared its current-task slot without
suspending it, so it was sound only when the caller suspended at once; it had
no production caller, the kernel's `yield` and `irq_wait` paths both being
documented as avoiding it, while `kernel/core::kthread_irq`'s and
`kernel/irq`'s rustdoc still described it as the `irq_wait` loop's yield. It is
gone from the trait, the three policies and the conformance suite, and the
docs describe the park the loop really performs.

## D294 — a scheduler's overflow list still grows infallibly on the wake and yield paths (OPEN)

Each policy routes a task its CPU's queue refuses — full, or unable to grow
under D291's fallible push — to a `SpinLock<Vec<TaskId>>` overflow list whose
`push` grows infallibly, so under memory exhaustion a wake still aborts the
kernel, one level down from where D291 left it. The fix is an intrusive link in
the task record, so neither enqueue path allocates at all, with a mark that
refuses a second insertion: a stale queue entry can make a task overflow twice.
It changes all three policies' overflow paths and the drain's ordering, so it
is recorded rather than folded into D291. Noticed fixing D291.

## D295 — two timer-HAL conformance tests raced the preempt suite over shared statics — FIXED

The timer HAL's `installed_callback_fires_on_dispatch` installs a tick callback
and dispatches through it; on aarch64 and riscv64 the callback lives in the
preempt module's process-global slot, which every preempt test's
`clear_for_tests` clears, and the timer-HAL test took none of that suite's
lock. The harness runs a crate's tests on parallel threads, so a clear landing
between the install and the dispatch failed the round trip — wasm32 already
held the lock for this reason. Each port's preempt lock now lives beside the
statics it guards (`preempt::test_state_lock`) rather than inside the test
module, and every test touching them holds it: the preempt suite, the
timer-HAL vertical, and the Arch HAL conformance test, which reads the quantum
from those slots (D290). The fix is structural — no test can reach the statics
unguarded — since a thread interleaving between two test functions has no
deterministic reproducer; the rule is D117's: a host test reads process-global
state only under the lock of the suite that owns it.

## D296 — a kill's death was decided in three places, none of them first — FIXED

**Mechanism.** A kill told the scheduler to retire its victim (`exit`, which
marks it doomed) and only then recorded the death the retire owed
(`defer_running_kill`). A victim executing elsewhere could be retired by its
own CPU, and that CPU's dispatch loop look for the death, in between: the death
was recorded after the only point that would ever land it. The parent's `wait`
never saw the exit, the process was never reclaimed, and the stray entry kept
every later dispatch on the gate's slow path. `stress-qemu-aarch64` hung on
exactly that — nine of ten `Terminate`d workers reaped, the tenth gone from the
scheduler with its exit never recorded, and the grace-window `Kill` answering
"target absent".

The same split between the scheduler's doom, the gate's two registers, and the
thread's own teardown let a death go wrong in five further ways:

* **Twice.** A killer's view of the group is a snapshot. One taken before a
  thread's teardown and acted on after it recorded a death nothing would clear,
  which the dispatch loop then landed on a process already torn down — or, once
  the id was drawn again, on a thread of another process. A group exit that
  found a sibling already doomed landed it itself as well as leaving it to its
  retire, and `thread_create`, finding the thread it had just registered
  already retired by such a kill, landed it again on its failure path. A
  thread the group table no longer holds reads as the group's last, so each
  second landing tore the process down under its live threads.
* **On a queued thread.** The dispatch loop landed any recorded death after any
  dispatch of its thread. `Deferred` did not mean the run would retire the
  task: nothing ordered the killer's doom-then-probe against the dispatch's
  release-then-read, so on x86_64 and riscv64 the killer could see the body held
  while the run read the mark stale and queued the task again. The landing then
  reclaimed a process whose thread was still runnable.
* **Mid-body.** The in-kernel check and `exit` were separate steps, so a victim
  that entered the kernel and parked between them was retired as quiescent. A
  victim doomed in user mode that then entered a kernel body and yielded
  (`yield_if_owed` on the shared block path) was retired at that yield. And the
  user-fault resolver, which parks on the filesystem, was not bracketed by the
  gate at all. Each frees a stack whose frames own kernel state: D112's wedge.
* **Never.** A victim doomed in user mode that entered a blocking syscall before
  taking the nudge parked with its death owed and nothing to wake it. A thread
  created while its group was being killed was never claimed, and outlived the
  kill.
* **Missed nudge.** A killer that saw the victim's body held but no current-task
  slot naming it sent no IPI, since nothing orders the dispatch's slot store
  before its lock store for the killer; a victim alone on a tickless core then
  ran on. And a fault resolver that parked and resumed on another core reported
  the core it faulted on, so the port suspended the wrong CPU's task.

**The protocol now.** One owed register replaces the two, and each death lands
exactly once.

* A group death is recorded for every member first
  (`procsignal::claim_group_kill`), under the group table's read lock. The
  table is exact against both ends of a thread's life: `threads::retire` and
  the process teardown withdraw membership before they clear the gate, and
  `thread_create` refuses a thread whose creator owes a death
  (`register_unless_dying`), and lands a thread it could not start only if its
  own `exit` retired it (`start_parked`).
* The claim reports where each death is owed. At a boundary, the killer wakes
  the thread. At a retire, the killer calls `exit`, and a victim it finds
  quiescent is landed inline.
* `kernel_enter` reports a death already owed, and the syscall path, the
  deferred-load body, and the user-fault resolver (now bracketed, re-reading
  its core at the boundary) then skip their body for their boundary. A thread
  the scheduler was told to retire is never inside a body.
* The dispatch loop lands only a thread the scheduler reports `Exited`
  (`land_retired_kill`).
* `park::doom`/`park::observe_doom` fence the kill's probe against the run's
  read, so `Deferred` is truthful in all three policies.
* `park::nudge_doomed` signals every CPU when no slot names the doomed task.
* The driver unload claims its group through the same function. It retires
  only a thread its own `exit` retired, since a member the scheduler no longer
  knows is one whose landing is under way elsewhere, and it keeps its inline
  teardown for the rest (D271).

`TaskReclaim::land_thread_down`'s rustdoc claimed idempotency the landing rule
does not have — a thread the table no longer holds reads as the last one down —
and now states that each death is handed to exactly one landing.

**Tests** (each fails on the code before this change):
`a_kill_whose_victim_retires_before_the_killer_returns_still_lands` (the
stress hang, through a scheduler that retires the victim and runs its dispatch
loop before the kill returns),
`a_group_exit_leaves_a_dying_sibling_to_the_death_it_already_owes`,
`only_a_retired_thread_has_its_death_landed_by_the_dispatch_loop`,
`a_retired_thread_keeps_no_death_and_can_be_claimed_for_none`,
`no_thread_is_born_into_a_group_claimed_for_death`,
`a_thread_its_group_killed_before_it_started_is_landed_once`,
`a_syscall_made_while_a_death_is_owed_runs_no_handler`,
`a_fault_taken_while_a_death_is_owed_lands_that_death`,
`a_thread_owing_a_death_enters_the_kernel_only_to_die`,
`an_unload_leaves_a_thread_it_did_not_retire_to_the_landing_under_way`,
`a_doomed_task_no_cpu_names_is_nudged_everywhere`, and
`a_kill_and_a_returning_body_never_both_miss_each_other` — a store-buffering
litmus run of the real mark and body lock, which records hundreds to thousands
of forbidden outcomes per 400 000 rounds with the fences removed and none with
them. The conformance property
`an_exit_over_a_readmission_retires_the_queued_task` pins, in all three
policies, that an exit decided over a remote park and wake retires the task
where it is queued.

## D297 — every syscall and user fault takes the one global kill-gate lock (OPEN)

**What.** `kernel_enter` and `kernel_exit_take_kill` bracket every syscall, the
deferred-load body and (since D296) every user fault. Each takes
`procsignal`'s single global `SpinLock` and inserts into or removes from a
shared `BTreeSet` of in-kernel threads. On a machine with many cores taking
syscalls and faults at once, every entry and exit serialises on that one cache
line. A B-tree node split or merge allocates or frees on the syscall path, and
fails as an abort rather than a value; a kill's claim allocates the same way.

**Why it is not absorbed.** The structural fix is per-thread gate state created
fallibly at thread admission and reached without a global structure. The state
fits one word: an in-kernel bit, an owed bit, the teardown kind and its
status. The victim's own entry and exit then become one atomic read-modify-write
each on that word, reached from the current CPU's published thread. A killer's
claim becomes a compare-and-swap on the same word, which linearises with the
victim's entry exactly as the lock does now. That is a new per-thread record
threaded through every user-thread admission (process spawn, `thread_create`,
PID 1, the driver loader) and published at switch-in beside the process space.
It is a design change to thread admission, not a local fix.

**Remains.** The per-thread gate word and its admission-time allocation, the
switch-in publication, and a loom model of the claim-versus-entry protocol on
it, which also needs the kernel crate graph to build under `--cfg loom` (D131).

## D325 — an application is never told the pointer left its window (OPEN)

**What.** The window channel carries a pointer move, press and release to the
application whose client is under the pointer, and nothing when the pointer
goes: the window manager's `client_pointer_moved` answers a move over the
desktop, over furniture or over another window without addressing the window
the pointer came from, and `PointerAction` has no leave. So whatever a client
drew for the pointer — a hovered row, a lit scrollbar, a tile's hover plate —
stays lit after the pointer has left the window, until the pointer comes back.
Inside a window the regions are told (the Settings shell shows the region a
move leaves that move); the window itself cannot be, because no event reaches
it.

**Why it is not absorbed.** The fix is a protocol change carried by every
client: a leave in `lib/abi`'s window events, the window manager tracking the
client that holds the pointer and naming it when that changes — by motion, by a
window rising over it, by a grab ending elsewhere, exactly the rules
`lib/input`'s `PointerFocus` already states for the session's own surfaces —
the session delivering it, and each application dropping its pointer state on
it. It spans the ABI, the compositor, the session and every windowed
application at once.

**Remains.** The leave event and its C-header view, the window manager's
client-hover tracking with its tests over the three ways a pointer leaves, the
session's delivery, and each application's handling with a regression test
that a hover does not survive the pointer leaving the window.


## D326 — a Settings round that submits an elevation presents nothing (OPEN)

**What.** `userland/apps/settings/src/run.rs` presents a round's damage only
for `Acted::Changed` and presents whole only for the kinds its `whole` list
names; `Acted::Elevate` is in neither. With a worker the round's own drawing is
dropped, which costs nothing visible today because the credential sheet draws
no pending state. Without one — the fallback where the machine grants no worker
and the broker is called on the loop's thread — `act` adopts the verdict and
lays the shell out, and nothing presents it: the sheet stays up, or its refusal
stays unshown, until the next event repaints.

**Why it is not absorbed.** The fix is small — `act` reports that it laid the
shell out, and the repaint takes the reported damage for an elevation round
and the whole client for an adopted verdict — but `run.rs` builds only for the
bare-metal targets, so no host test can pin it. Its regression test needs the
round-to-repaint decision moved into the host-tested library.

**Remains.** That decision as a pure function in `tairix-settings` with its
tests (an elevation round presents what it reported; an inline verdict presents
the whole client), and `run.rs` reading it.


## D327 — a pixel-scrolled list cannot reach a row past 2^31 pixels (OPEN)

**What.** Every scrolling list now scrolls by pixels: its lines are laid out
unscrolled at their natural size and shown through `lib/controls`'
`ScrollView`. A line is placed at its absolute content coordinate —
`ListView::row_rect` and `SidebarView::row_rect` add the line's offset to an
`i32` top with a checked add — and `ScrollView` holds its offset as a `u32`,
saturating the `u64` the scroll model carries. A line whose top lies past
`i32::MAX` therefore has no rectangle: it is never painted or hit, and the view
cannot be scrolled to it. At the file listing's 22-pixel row at 1× that is some
97 million entries, half that at 2×. The row-offset design these lists replaced
addressed a line by its index and had no such ceiling, and a storage-scale count
may not be one that only fits in 32 bits.

**Why it is not absorbed.** The fix belongs to the shared seam rather than to
one list: `ScrollView` carries the full `u64` offset and places lines relative
to the first one it shows, so a window coordinate is always a short distance
from that line and never the absolute content position. Every consumer — the
listing, the rail, the chooser and Properties sections, Settings, Switchboard,
the taskbar's popups, the text area — then lays out and hit-tests through it,
which changes the geometry contract of every scrolling surface at once.

**Remains.** `ScrollView` over a `u64` offset, placing lines from the first one
shown; `ListView`, `GridView`, `SidebarView` and the other consumers laying out
and hit-testing through it; and a regression test that lays out, paints,
hit-tests, and scrolls to the last row of a list whose content is taller than
`i32::MAX` pixels.

## D359 — x86_64 was soft-float, and the x87 file was shared between tasks — FIXED

**Cause.** `x86_64-unknown-none` is rustc's soft-float, SSE-disabled target,
and the kernel and every user program built for it: each `f32`/`f64`
operation was a `compiler_builtins` libcall, the SSE2 hash scan and SSE2
ChaCha20 compiled out, and the RustCrypto crates needed `*_backend="soft"` pins
just to compile. rustc refuses to change a target's float ABI through
`-C target-feature`. Separately, `CR0.EM` was clear, so ring 3 could execute
x87 and MMX, and nothing saved that state on a switch: one task could read
another's registers.

**Fixed.**

- Both build for `.cargo/x86_64-tairix-none.json`, the builtin spec with the
  float ABI changed and the SSE2 baseline kept, selected by path and compiled
  with `-Z build-std` (`tairix_itest_harness::pie::cargo_target_args`). The
  soft pins are gone.
- The kernel writes only `xmm0`–`xmm15`'s low halves and `MXCSR`: the floor may
  never imply VEX (`the_x86_64_floor_implies_no_extended_register_state` asks
  rustc), its own dispatch is never offered an AVX family
  (`CpuFeatureSet::without_extended_register_state`), and the built kernel
  holds one x87 instruction, the enable's `fninit`. Every stub that calls Rust
  frames exactly that set and loads the kernel `MXCSR` (`fpu.rs`).
- The extended state is saved per task at park into an area directly above
  `RSP0` and loaded in each stub's naked ring-3 exit when a resume found the
  registers no longer the task's (`xstate.rs`). `XCR0` enables x87, SSE, AVX,
  and the AVX-512 trio when present. The boot CPU and each AP enable the FPU
  before their first Rust instruction; an AP whose XSAVE layout differs from
  the boot CPU's fails its bring-up.

**Regression cover.** `fp_isolation_qemu_x86_64` runs under `qemu64`
(FXSAVE64), `max,-xsaveopt` (XSAVE) and `max` (XSAVEOPT with AVX): probe tasks
hold their whole register files across yields, faults and preemption, and the
kernel computes under a probe's unmasked exceptions and rounding mode. With the
target changed but no entry framing, three verticals failed on corrupted user
memory — the netstack's route table and a driver bundle read — which is the
per-entry frame's own regression. The ownership state machine is model-checked
on the host over random migrations, reused areas, double parks and deaths
without a park, and the model catches a resume that ignores where the area
last lived.

## D363 — no audited hardware crypto backend is reachable on a TAIRiX target (OPEN)

**Cause.** The audited RustCrypto crates — `aes`, `sha2`, `polyval`,
`chacha20`, `poly1305` — pick their accelerated backends through
`cpufeatures`, which on `target_os = "none"` answers only the features the
build enables at compile time. No TAIRiX target enables AES-NI, SHA-NI,
PCLMULQDQ, AVX2 or the ARMv8 crypto extensions at compile time, because one
image boots every part of its architecture, so every accelerated backend is
unreachable; what runs is the portable one, or SSE2/NEON where the baseline
carries it. TAIRiX's own detector knows exactly which parts have the
instructions, but may not transcribe the primitives over intrinsics itself.

**Needs.** A vetted, audited backend TAIRiX can drive from its own detection
— an upstream detection hook, or an audited crate exposing its backends — a
supply-chain decision. Until then `lib/crypto` records the honest software
answer (D361), and the kernel never offers a VEX backend in any case.

## D369 — the EMMC2 data clock was half SD Default Speed — FIXED

`DATA_CLOCK_DIVISOR` was `IDENT_CLOCK_DIVISOR / 32`, base/8 whatever the base,
so the Pi 4's card moved data at 12.5 MHz. Every SD clock is now divided from
the base clock actually feeding the controller — the firmware's EMMC2 clock,
else the capabilities register's — and bring-up negotiates the fastest bus the
card and board carry: UHS-I DDR50 at 1.8 V where the board can switch the
card's rails, else High Speed at 50 MHz, else Default Speed at 25 MHz, each
verified by a read before it is kept. Regression tests:
`with_a_supply_the_card_runs_ddr50_at_1v8`,
`without_a_supply_the_card_runs_high_speed_on_the_4bit_bus`,
`the_platforms_base_clock_outranks_the_capabilities` and the mock's
clock-ceiling assertion, which fails any command clocked faster than the
card's state allows. Its metal run is `plans/PI.md` P8.

## D382 — a kernel fault in the Pi 4 root-unlock thread printed no report (OPEN)

Zeroing a DMA carve through an invalid identity-window slot (D383) took a
translation fault in the root-unlock kernel thread on a Pi 4B. Nothing reached
the UART after the last queued line, and the lockup watchdog said nothing
either. `fatal_exception` hands the fault to the kernel's fatal bridge, which
flushes the queued console before parking (`flush_console_blocking`), so the
report stalled or was lost before that flush: in stopping the other CPUs, or in
a second fault inside the report, which the one-shot fatal latch parks
silently. Localising it needs a deliberate kernel fault on metal. Its
regression test is a kernel data abort in a kernel thread whose report reaches
the capture.

## D383 — the aarch64 root-unlock DMA pools used the sparse identity window (OPEN)

Both aarch64 root-unlock arms built their `DmaPool` over
`DirectPhysMap::identity(identity_limit())`, whose contract is that all of
`[0, limit)` is mapped. The boot identity window is deliberately sparse — it
maps only the gigapages the kernel addresses physically and the board's
Device gigapages — so any allocator frame outside them was an invalid slot.
The EMMC2 staging, once carved below its DMA window's ceiling, landed at the
top of gigapage 2 and faulted when zeroed. The pools now reach frames through
the kernel's direct map (`SPAWN_TABLE_PHYSMAP`), as the x86_64 and riscv64
arms already did, and register windows through `DeviceWindows`, which
translates only inside the identity window's Device gigapages
(`paging::identity_device_covers`, host-tested). On a Pi 4B the EMMC2
staging now carves at `0xBFFC_0000` and serves the root at UHS-I DDR50.

It stays open for its regression test. The root-unlock admission vertical
runs the production arm, but its virtio carves are unconstrained, and the
allocator's LIFO heads are low, recently freed blocks by the time the unlock
runs: with 2 GiB of guest RAM they still land in the kernel's own gigapage,
so the old map passes too. The failure needs a carve bounded above that
gigapage, which the unlock path makes only for the EMMC2 staging, and QEMU
models no EMMC2.

## D384 — a delegated grant outlives its grantor (OPEN)

`AddressSpaceRegistry::delegate_grant` mints the recipient a grant keyed by
the delegating process instance and the resource, and nothing ends it but the
recipient's own exit or a hardware-node revocation: `withdraw` reaps only file
delegations naming the exiting task. A desktop session receiving frame regions
from every application it outlives keeps one entry per application instance
and region, and `existing_handle` scans all of them on every mint, so the
table and the mint cost grow for the life of the session. Keying by grantor
widened what was already true of regions, whose ids are never reused. The fix
must decide when a delegated grant ends — when its grantor exits, when the
region it names is destroyed, or both — without tearing down a mapping the
recipient still presents from. Its regression test is a recipient whose table
returns to its size after the processes that delegated to it have gone.

## D385 — a program without filesystem access cannot read its own Help (OPEN)

`lib/help`'s `BundleHelp` locates the running program's bundle and opens
`Help/` through `fs_open`, which the dispatcher gates on `CAP_FS_ACCESS`.
TextEdit, Paint and the viewer are handed every document by the user and hold
no filesystem capability by design, so their `-h`, `--help` and `-?` exit 1 with
"help documents could not be read" and leave an audited denial, while their
own Help pages describe those switches. Requesting `CAP_FS_ACCESS` would give
each the user's whole filesystem for a help page. The fix is a read path to a
program's own bundle only — a descriptor the loader hands over at spawn, or an
open resolved against the bundle the kernel loaded — which is an ABI decision.
Its regression test is `TextEdit -h` printing its short help in a guest.

## D386 — the x87 scrub names kernel addresses on AMD parts before Zen 2 (OPEN)

On the parts that set the FXSAVE-leak flag, FXSAVE and FXRSTOR move the x87
last-instruction, last-data and last-opcode registers only with an exception
pending, so `tairix_arch_x86_64_x87_scrub` loads a kernel constant ahead of
each restore to stop one task reading the last task's. That leaves those
registers naming the scrub's own kernel text and data, which the next task
reads with `FNSTENV`. While the x86_64 kernel links at a fixed base this
discloses nothing; once it is relocated per boot it hands every task the
slide. The candidates are `FNINIT`, which the manuals say clears both
pointers but which must be confirmed on K8-to-Zen 1 silicon, or a scrub
instruction and operand placed in a mapping KASLR never moves. Its regression
test reads the pointers from a fresh task on an affected part and finds no
kernel address.
