# GUI Controls Design Specification: Reactive Alloy

Status: Design specification  
Audience: TAIRiX desktop, window manager, taskbar, application, and shared GUI crate contributors  
Primary product context: TAIRiX graphical session  
Scope: General GUI controls across TAIRiX, including but not limited to Switchboard  
Design language name: Reactive Alloy  
Tagline: Stable surfaces. Live edges. Clear intent. Confident actions.

---

## Assumptions

- This document specifies TAIRiX graphical controls, not kernel behavior and not a new system-call surface.
- The implementation belongs in the TAIRiX graphical userland and shared Rust crates already described by the charter: `userland/gui/wm`, `userland/gui/taskbar`, `userland/gui/session`, `lib/window`, `lib/theme`, `lib/geometry`, `lib/raster`, `lib/icon`, `lib/input`, and application crates that render their own GUI controls.
- Theme values, metrics, motion timings, and semantic colors are shared data. They are not duplicated per application.
- Controls render state and suggest actions, but authority remains enforced by the existing capability-checked syscall and IPC paths.
- Exact public Rust item names are established during implementation review. The Rust identifiers used here are specification vocabulary and must not be treated as committed API names until they are added to the tree with tests and documentation.
- The window manager owns outer window-frame and furniture rendering, hit testing, pointer capture, move and resize behavior, stacking actions, minimization, and size-state transitions. Applications provide typed metadata and receive typed events through the existing window path; they do not paint over or intercept window-manager chrome.
- A root client viewport may expose window-level scrollbars composed by the window manager. Nested scrollbars inside application content remain application controls. Both forms use the same theme tokens, range invariants, and orientation-independent behavior rather than separate vertical, horizontal, window-manager, and application recipes.

## 1. Purpose

Reactive Alloy is the TAIRiX GUI control design language for systems where the state around a control changes continuously: tasks appear and exit, background jobs progress, resource pressure rises, devices arrive, permissions differ, panels resize, and recovery actions become available.

The goal is to make controls feel alive without making them feel unstable.

A Reactive Alloy control communicates three things at a glance:

1. What action is available.
2. What surrounding state makes that action relevant.
3. Whether the action is safe, recommended, delayed, privileged, or destructive.

Switchboard is the flagship example because it exposes live task, job, recovery, and system state, but this specification is deliberately broader. The same language applies to buttons, toggles, sliders, fields, menus, tables, toolbars, taskbar items, notifications, dialogs, window frames, title bars, window furniture, scrollbars, and application controls.

### Every control and window-furniture item is first-class

Every control and every piece of window furniture named in this specification —
buttons (Button, IconButton, SplitButton), boolean selectors (Toggle, Checkbox,
Radio), value controls (Slider, Progress, Chart), text entry (TextField, SearchField,
TextArea), choice entry (ComboBox), navigation and command surfaces (Menu, MenuItem,
Toolbar, Tabs, Breadcrumb, ActionRail), collection controls (ListRow, TableRow,
TableCell, TableHeader, Card, Panel, MetricTile, StatusPill), record lists
(FactList, Timeline), decision surfaces
(Dialog, Tooltip, HelpTip), shell surfaces
(Notification, TaskbarItem, TraySignal), and the window-manager furniture (WindowFrame,
TitleBar, the WindowControl set — Close, Minimize, PutToBack, SizeToggle — the
ResizeGrabber, the ScrollBar in both orientations, and the ScrollCorner) — is a
**first-class control**. Each MUST be **fully implemented**: not stubbed, not a
"minimal for now" core, not a partial subset of the states §11 gives it, and
not something an application is expected to hand-roll.

"Fully implemented" for a control means all of the following are present, correct,
and tested before the control is considered done (§20, `AGENTS.md` §27):

- Every state §11 specifies for that control, composed from the typed §5 state
  model (never an ad-hoc per-control flag bag).
- Dark and light theme coverage, high-contrast shape fallbacks (§15), and
  reduced-motion behaviour (§9), all resolved from `Theme` and `Scale` (§6, §14).
- Its complete pointer, keyboard, and focus behaviour (§11, §15).
- Authority-denied, pending, failed-closed, and destructive rendering wherever the
  control can express them, distinct from a plain disabled state (§13).
- Its §20 tests, including the furniture and scrollbar checklists.

None of these controls is optional, deferrable, or reducible to a placeholder.
A control that is missing a specified state, a theme variant, an accessibility
fallback, or a keyboard path is incomplete and is a defect, regardless of
whether it compiles or its current call site exercises the missing part
(`AGENTS.md` §27, §23). The staged build order in this plan
sequences *when* each family lands; it never licenses shipping any of them in a
thinned-down form.

### Nothing is deferred, no-opped, or left "for now"

Every behaviour this specification describes is implemented properly in the
change that introduces it — never deferred to a "later stage", stubbed with a
`TODO`, or handled by a no-op match arm that silently drops input
(`AGENTS.md` §2.1, §2.17, §2.18, §2.19, §2.23, §27). This binds input paths as
much as rendering: a scrollable surface handles **every** input the spec gives
it — keyboard line/page/bound navigation, thumb drag, *and* the mouse wheel
(§11.28) — in the same change, not "wheel later". A control or input path
delivered as "keyboard today, wheel to follow" is exactly the deferral this
rule forbids. If the proper implementation depends on prerequisite work (an ABI
event that does not exist, a routing seam that is missing), that prerequisite is
completed as part of the same change; if it genuinely cannot be, the conflict is
raised with the User (`AGENTS.md` §15.7), never papered over with a temporary
gap. A wheel event that genuinely has nothing to scroll (a live terminal screen
that keeps no scrollback) is a *correct, complete* answer, not a deferral — but
"there is nowhere to route this yet" is not.

### Do not remove a control's genuinely useful public API

These crates are developer-facing: `lib/controls`, `userland/gui/wm`,
`lib/window`, and the app crates expose public control and window-furniture APIs
that third-party developers and a proper, complete UI legitimately depend on. A
public item that is part of a *complete, correct* control surface — a viewport's
`clear_root_viewport`, a scroll model's step and query methods, a furniture
hit-test — is kept even when the in-tree call sites are few or absent, because
removing it takes a genuinely useful primitive away from a consumer and makes
the control *less* than fully implemented (`AGENTS.md` §27, §15.5). This does
**not** license speculative surface (`AGENTS.md` §2.3, §2.4): the bar is "part
of a proper, complete control that a developer would reasonably use", never
"might be handy one day". When it is unclear whether an item is load-bearing API
or genuine dead code, keep the complete primitive and ask (`AGENTS.md` §15.7)
rather than delete it.

## 2. Design Position

Reactive Alloy is an instrument-panel language, not a decorative material language.

The surface should feel engineered: matte graphite, ceramic enamel, machined rims, lit seams, pressure rails, and compact signal lamps. It should not feel like liquid, rubber, jelly, or novelty gloss. Movement and lighting show actual state, not ornament.

### Core principle

Motion belongs to edges, traces, seams, and state indicators. Layout belongs to the user.

The body of a control remains reliable. The live perimeter tells the story.

### What makes it modern

A control is not just `Idle`, `Hovered`, `Pressed`, and `Disabled`. It can also know that a related job is running, that memory pressure is relevant, that a destructive operation needs deliberate confirmation, that a sibling row changed, or that the active theme switched.

Those signals must remain small, typed, and intentional. A control becomes modern by exposing useful system context, not by moving unpredictably.

---

## 3. TAIRiX Charter Alignment

Reactive Alloy must preserve the existing TAIRiX architecture.

### Rust-only implementation

All implementation is Rust. UI control logic is expressed as typed Rust state, Rust enums, Rust structs, Rust traits where justified, and Rust drawing code using TAIRiX crates. No design requirement in this document requires non-Rust source.

### Optional desktop

The graphical desktop remains optional. Controls live in userland GUI code and shared GUI-adjacent `lib/*` crates. Headless builds must not depend on GUI crates.

### One drawing path

Controls are drawn through the existing compositor and raster path. Rounded corners, alpha blending, vector glyph rasterisation, icon drawing, and cached assets must use the shared TAIRiX drawing stack rather than per-control copies.

### Theme data, not code forks

Dark, light, high-contrast, reduced-motion, and density variants are theme data. Adding a theme must not require adding a sibling control implementation or duplicating constants.

### DPI and scale

All lengths are authored in logical pixels and converted through `tairix_geometry::Scale`. A control must never carry a private scale conversion or assume a fixed physical pixel density.

### No ambient authority

A button can render `ActionDenied`, `ActionUnavailable`, or `NeedsCapability`, but it must not bypass permission checks. The service that performs the action remains responsible for identity, capability checks, validation, logging, and fail-closed behavior.

### No pseudo-files for live system state

Controls that display tasks, resources, device state, or limits consume typed TAIRiX state from the appropriate model or System Information API client. They must not scrape a fabricated process or device tree.

---

## 4. Ownership and Crate Boundaries

Reactive Alloy should be implemented as shared control behavior and theme data, not duplicated visual recipes.

| Concern | TAIRiX owner |
|---|---|
| Active theme, palette, metrics, motion timings, cursor selection | `lib/theme` and `userland/gui/session` |
| Logical geometry, rectangles, points, scaling | `lib/geometry` |
| Premultiplied-alpha surfaces, fills, polygons, blits | `lib/raster` |
| Shared icons and vector glyphs | `lib/icon` and curated asset pipeline |
| Pointer and keyboard input vocabulary | `lib/input` |
| Compositing, clipping, window surfaces, rounded windows, frame furniture, activation, stacking, move, and resize | `userland/gui/wm` |
| Typed window metadata, close requests, constraints, and root viewport exchange | `lib/window`, the owning application, and `userland/gui/wm` |
| Taskbar items, notification area, session controls | `userland/gui/taskbar` |
| Application-specific control composition | owning application crate |
| Shared system information client state | existing ABI and client helper crates |

The control system may be a shared GUI crate only when at least two independent consumers need the same control behavior. If only one application needs a custom control, the control stays in that application until there is a second real consumer.

---

## 5. Rust Terminology and State Model

Reactive Alloy controls are modeled as typed widgets with typed state. Avoid unstructured key/value bags for core state.

The following vocabulary is normative for the specification, not a frozen public API.

```rust
pub enum ControlKind {
    Button,
    IconButton,
    SplitButton,
    Toggle,
    Checkbox,
    Radio,
    Slider,
    Progress,
    TextField,
    SearchField,
    ComboBox,
    MenuItem,
    Tab,
    ListRow,
    TableCell,
    Card,
    Panel,
    DialogAction,
    WindowFrame,
    TitleBar,
    WindowControl,
    ResizeGrabber,
    ScrollBar,
    TaskbarItem,
    TraySignal,
    Notification,
}

pub enum ControlRole {
    Neutral,
    Primary,
    Recommended,
    Destructive,
    Recovery,
    Navigation,
    System,
}

pub struct ControlState {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub focus: FocusState,
    pub pointer: PointerState,
    pub selection: SelectionState,
    pub validation: ValidationState,
    pub authority: AuthorityState,
    pub activity: ActivityState,
    pub pressure: PressureState,
    pub recovery: RecoveryState,
}

pub enum WindowControlKind {
    Close,
    Minimize,
    PutToBack,
    SizeToggle,
}

pub enum WindowActivationState {
    Active,
    Inactive,
    AttentionRequested,
}

pub enum WindowSizeState {
    Restored,
    Maximized,
}

pub enum ScrollOrientation {
    Vertical,
    Horizontal,
}

pub struct WindowFurnitureState {
    pub activation: WindowActivationState,
    pub size: WindowSizeState,
    pub movable: bool,
    pub resizable: bool,
}

pub struct ScrollRange {
    pub content_extent: u64,
    pub viewport_extent: u64,
    pub offset: u64,
}

pub struct ScrollModel {
    pub range: ScrollRange,
    pub line_step: u64,
    pub page_step: u64,
}
```

State composition is preferred over one enormous enum. A disabled destructive recovery button and a focused non-destructive primary button are different combinations of small typed fields, not unrelated custom code paths.

### Required state fields

| State field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FocusState` | Keyboard focus, active focus ring, focus field membership. |
| `PointerState` | None, hover, pressed, drag source, drag target. |
| `SelectionState` | Unselected, selected, mixed, current item. |
| `ValidationState` | Valid, warning, invalid, pending verification. |
| `AuthorityState` | Allowed, denied, needs confirmation, needs capability. |
| `ActivityState` | Idle, working, progress known, progress indeterminate, complete. |
| `PressureState` | CPU, memory, disk, network, power, thermal, or none. |
| `RecoveryState` | None, recoverable, hung, restart recommended, force action. |

### Window-furniture-specific state

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `WindowActivationState` | Whether a frame is active, inactive, or requesting attention without stealing focus. |
| `WindowSizeState` | Restored, maximized, or fullscreen. The size-toggle control never *reaches* fullscreen: only the owning application asks for it, over the window channel, and a fullscreen window withdraws its decoration entirely, so no control renders for it. |
| `WindowControlKind` | The exact window-manager command represented by a furniture button. |
| `ScrollOrientation` | Vertical or horizontal layout over one shared behavioral implementation. |
| `ScrollRange` | Content extent, viewport extent, and clamped offset used to derive thumb size and position. |
| `ScrollModel` | A validated range plus line-step and page-step distances in the same logical scroll unit. |

A `SizeToggle` renders the action that will occur next: `Maximize` while restored and `Restore` while maximized. A `ScrollRange` is normalized before painting or hit testing: when the viewport covers the content, the offset is zero; otherwise the offset cannot exceed `content_extent - viewport_extent`. Content extent, viewport extent, offset, line step, and page step use the same logical scroll unit declared by the owning viewport; they are not mixed implicitly between pixels, rows, or application records. Invalid, overflowing, or stale range data fails closed to a non-draggable, zero-offset scrollbar rather than producing out-of-bounds geometry.

### Reporting what changed

Equality (above) answers *whether* a control's surface changed; it cannot say *where*, so a host that only holds it repaints whole windows for a hover. Every input entry point therefore takes a damage sink — `&mut tairix_geometry::Region`, from `damage::sink()` — and pushes the rectangles it repainted into it, and the host renders and presents only those.

Exactly two guarded writes carry the rule, so nothing invents a third — and both are public, because a host reports its own drawn changes through the same two: `damage::set` writes one drawn field and reports the bounds it is drawn in when the value actually changed, and `damage::move_mark` reports the two children a mark moves between — the menu row a highlight leaves and the one it arrives on, the hovered tab, the focused crumb, the focused header column, the sorted column, a host's own keyboard focus — never the strip, popup, or window around them. The mark is compared whole, so the same child marked differently (a sort caret turning over) is still a changed child. A `RenderInvariant` field reports nothing, exactly as it compares equal.

A control reports every drawn change it makes itself. Two kinds of change are the *host's* to report, because the host is what knows where it put the controls:

- **A value the host commits back into a control.** A control never mutates its own committed value (the Reactive Alloy rule above): it reports an action and the owner writes the value in. The owner holds that control's rectangle at exactly that moment, and the value is drawn inside it, so the owner reports it — nothing narrower is available and nothing wider is needed.
- **A mark of the host's own that moves between two controls.** Keyboard focus is the one every host has: each control's ring is a function of the host's own focus field, so `damage::move_mark` over that field names the control the ring left and the control it arrives on. A focus that lands on the host's own chrome maps to `None`, and the chrome reports its own pixels.

The exception is a mark a container draws on one of its own children, whose two rectangles only that container can name. Those setters take the layout the host already renders and hit-tests with, and report: `Breadcrumb::set_focus`, `TableHeader::set_focus`, `TableHeader::set_sort`, `Tabs::set_current`, `Tabs::set_selected`, `Menu::set_current`.

A host that is *composing or rebuilding* a control is the case that proves the rule: it has no layout to resolve a child against, and nothing to report against either, because it presents that surface whole. It must say so rather than fabricate the inputs — `adopt_focus`, `adopt_sort`, `adopt_current` and `adopt_selected` adopt the mark without reporting, each sharing the one admission rule with its reporting sibling so a rebuild cannot admit a mark the interactive path would refuse. Passing a made-up rectangle, scale, or theme to the reporting form is forbidden: it compiles, reports nothing today, and is one read away from being silently wrong.

Over-covering is safe and under-covering is not: a reported rectangle that did not change costs one redundant repaint, while an unreported change leaves a stale pixel on screen. Where the two are in tension — a disabled control that tracks hover it does not draw — the report stands.

### Painting only what the surface will keep — done

A report buys nothing if the render walks the surface regardless. A clip window withholds a control's *writes*, never its composition — measuring a label, eliding it, rasterising a glyph, all before the first write — so a scoped repaint used to pay for every control the damage excluded. Every `render` therefore opens with the shared gate (`paint::withheld`) and returns at once when the surface admits no pixel of its `bounds`. Measured over forty composed list rows, a repaint scoped to one row fell from 838 µs to 25 µs against 1.1 ms for the whole list (`cargo xtask bench --filter controls`): three fifths of a whole render is composition, and it survived any clip.

The gate rests on one obligation, and it binds every family: **a family paints inside the `bounds` it is given and nowhere else.** `paint_tests` asserts that, and the byte-identity of a band-clipped paint against the same band of a whole one, over every family in one table — so a family added later joins both. A family drawn *below* a documented floor of its own is not held to it (a title band narrower than `TitleBar::min_band_width` deliberately abuts its clusters), so the table names the rectangle each family is contracted to be drawn in. Landing this found one real overhang: `Slider` seated its groove at the thumb-centre origin while giving it the whole control's width, so it reached half a thumb past its own right edge.


---

## 6. Theme Model

Every visible property must resolve from the active `Theme` plus control state. A control must not hard-code colors, radii, font sizes, or animation timings outside test fixtures.

**Nor may a control accept a visible property from its caller.** A control takes no typeface argument: it names the job its text does (a `TextRole`) and the theme answers with the face, sized through the one shared `Scale`. Hard-coding a face and accepting one are the same defect wearing different clothes — both put a visible property somewhere other than the theme — and accepting one is the more dangerous, because it launders the violation through a call site that looks innocent. It is not a theoretical risk: the graphical terminal drew the shared menu and settings sheet in its own monospace grid face, at the user's terminal text size, simply because that was the face it had to hand. An application draws its *own* content in whatever face it likes; a shared control is desktop furniture and reads as such wherever it appears.

```rust
pub struct Theme {
    pub palette: Palette,
    pub metrics: Metrics,
    pub typography: Typography,
    pub motion: MotionTheme,
    pub controls: ControlThemeSet,
    pub cursors: CursorTheme,
}
```

### Themeable values

| Theme value | Examples |
|---|---|
| Palette roles | `surface`, `surface_elevated`, `surface_hover`, `surface_pressed`, `document`, `title_band`, `text`, `text_muted`, `rim`, `rim_active`, `accent`, `danger`, the window-frame role, scroll track, and scroll thumb, the one light the desktop is lit by (`bevel_light` and `bevel_shade`, the furniture bevel's translucent washes, and `drop_shadow`), plus the two opacities floating chrome is drawn at (`chrome_alpha`, `chrome_plate_alpha`). |
| Semantic signal roles | `cpu_pressure`, `memory_pressure`, `disk_pressure`, `network_activity`, `recovery`, `success`, `warning`, `denied`. |
| Metrics | Control height, inset, gap, corner radius, border width, seam thickness, rail thickness, bead size, title-bar height, frame inset, window-control extent, resize-grabber extent, scrollbar breadth, minimum thumb length, invisible hit slop, the taskbar's margin off the screen edges it faces, the blur behind floating chrome, and how far a floating surface's drop shadow reaches. |
| Typography | Font family token, label size, caption size, numeric size, weight roles, active title weight, and inactive title weight. |
| Motion | Open duration, hover duration, press duration, progress tick cadence, window activation, minimize and size-toggle transitions, scrollbar wake timing, and reduced-motion policy. |
| Window furniture | Active/inactive treatment, frame profile, scrollbar placement, and grip geometry. |
| Density | Compact, normal, comfortable. |
| Contrast | Normal, high contrast, monochrome-safe signal shape fallback. |

Window-command placement and order are **not** themeable: the two corner clusters and the left-justified identity group of §11.18 are the one arrangement, so a window read on one machine is read the same way on the next. The visible glyph, tooltip, accessibility name, and keyboard command for each control identify `Close`, `Minimize`, `PutToBack`, or the next `SizeToggle` action unambiguously.

### Theme variants

TAIRiX must ship dark and light variants. Additional variants are data over the same typed model. A variant may alter color, radius, density, and motion, but must not change the meaning of state.

For example, `PressureKind::Memory` remains the same state in every theme. One theme may render it purple, another may render it with a patterned rail. The semantic value stays typed.

### Semantic color discipline

Accent colors are not raw decoration. They map to state:

| Semantic role | Default meaning |
|---|---|
| Accent | Primary action, active selection, current route. |
| CPU pressure | Compute saturation or compute-heavy work. |
| Memory pressure | Memory pressure or memory-caused slowdown. |
| Disk pressure | Storage throughput, copy, indexing, verification. |
| Network activity | Transfer, sync, remote I/O. |
| Recovery | Hung, not responding, repair, restart, force action. |
| Success | Completed, verified, recovered. |
| Warning | Elevated impact, caution, delayed risk. |
| Denied | Missing authority or blocked action. |

A theme may map multiple semantic roles to the same hue only if it also provides a distinct shape, rail position, bead mark, or text label.

---

## 7. Reactive Alloy Visual Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Alloy Plate | The base matte control surface. |
| Plate Seating | Whether a control wears an Alloy Plate and Signal Rim of its own, or is seated *in* a bar and wears neither. |
| Signal Rim | The one-pixel or scaled reactive perimeter. |
| Heat Seam | A progress or activity line on an edge. |
| Pressure Rail | A side indicator showing resource pressure. |
| Signal Bead | A compact badge for counts, alerts, and state. |
| Recovery Latch | A deliberate high-impact action treatment. |
| Focus Field | A grouped focus highlight around a related control set. |
| Trace Line | A short-lived cause-and-effect connector. |
| Action Warmth | A stronger edge treatment for the recommended action. |
| Authority Mark | A locked, denied, or capability-required marker. |
| Frame Rim | The window-manager-owned perimeter around a client surface: one quiet neutral, the same at every activation. |
| Grip Teeth | A repeated notch shape that marks a resize grabber without relying on color. |
| Scroll Channel | The quiet track, page regions, and thumb that expose viewport position and extent. |

These are not separate widgets. They are rendering layers that any control can use when the control state requires them.

---

## 8. Drawing Stack

A Reactive Alloy control paints in ordered layers. Each layer is optional, but the order is fixed for consistency and testability.

1. Clip to control bounds and rounded shape.
2. Paint shadow or occlusion only when the theme enables elevation. A floating surface's own drop shadow is not this step: the compositor casts it outside the surface's silhouette (window composition stack, step 1), so no surface paints a shadow into its own pixels.
3. Paint the Alloy Plate.
4. Paint inner tint or subtle material grain if provided by the theme.
5. Paint Signal Rim.
6. Paint Pressure Rail.
7. Paint Heat Seam.
8. Paint content: icon, label, value, shortcut, disclosure mark.
9. Paint Signal Bead.
10. Paint focus ring or Focus Field.
11. Paint transient Trace Line overlays through the owning container.

All alpha values are premultiplied. All geometry passes through shared logical-to-physical scaling. Every clipped rounded edge uses the shared compositor/raster path.

### Window composition stack

A top-level window uses a second fixed composition order owned by `userland/gui/wm`:

1. Cast the window's drop shadow onto what lies beneath it: its silhouette dropped under an overhead light, outside the silhouette only, while the window is restored.
2. Paint the Frame Rim and its bevel, then the frame plate.
3. Blit the application surface into the client clip only.
4. Paint the title bar, and the left-justified application identity glyph and title text, then the band's shaded foot.
5. Paint the two corner clusters of window-control buttons and their independent hover, press, focus, and disabled states.
6. Paint vertical and horizontal scrollbars when the root viewport exposes them.
7. Paint the scroll corner or ResizeGrabber above the scrollbar junction.
8. Paint the active-window focus treatment and transient attention signals.

The application surface cannot cover, clip, or receive pointer events from the outer frame, title bar, window controls, scrollbars owned by the root viewport, or resize grabber. The window manager maintains a separate furniture hit map so an application-drawn lookalike inside the client area cannot impersonate or intercept the actual frame controls.

---

## 9. Motion Model

Reactive Alloy motion is magnetic, not liquid.

Controls may lift, compress, brighten, or expose a seam. They must not wobble, slosh, stretch text, detach from the pointer, or shift layout unexpectedly.

### Timing targets

| Interaction | Target duration |
|---|---:|
| Hover enter | 90-120 ms |
| Hover exit | 80-110 ms |
| Press compression | 60-90 ms |
| Release settle | 90-130 ms |
| Panel open | 180-240 ms |
| Menu open | 120-180 ms |
| Job progress pulse | 120-180 ms, event driven |
| Recovery latch reveal | 180-260 ms |
| Window activate or deactivate | 90-140 ms |
| Minimize, restore, or size toggle | 160-240 ms |
| Scrollbar wake or settle | 70-120 ms |
| Selection change | 90-120 ms |
| Theme switch repaint | One coherent frame sequence, no mixed half-theme frame |

The durations are theme data, held as one table indexed by the interaction
rather than a field per interaction: they are all the same type, so positional
arguments could be transposed silently and a new interaction would change every
call site's arity.

### Reduced motion

The active `MotionTheme` must include a reduced-motion mode. In reduced motion, state still changes visibly, but through static contrast, rail thickness, shape marks, and text labels rather than animated transitions.

### Event-driven animation

Animation starts from state changes: pointer input, focus change, progress update, theme switch, or typed system state update. Controls must not run idle decorative loops.

Pointer-coupled movement is not animated behind the pointer. Window move, window resize, and scrollbar-thumb drag update geometry on the next available frame with no easing or delayed interpolation. A short release transition is permitted only for an explicit snap, maximize, restore, or minimize result, and it must be removed in reduced-motion mode.

---

## 10. Themeable Control Anatomy

A control is composed from a small, shared set of parts.

```text
ControlBounds
  AlloyPlate
  SignalRim
  PressureRail
  HeatSeam
  ContentGroup
    LeadingIcon
    Label
    ValueText
    ShortcutText
    TrailingIcon
  SignalBead
  FocusRing
```

### Required anatomy rules

- Content remains aligned while edge signals change.
- Label text never shifts because a Signal Rim brightened.
- Progress seams do not change the measured size of the control.
- Signal Beads never displace content by appearing. Where content must stay
  aligned across rows or columns (the row family, §11.13), the trailing bead
  band is reserved from the control's own size whether or not a bead is drawn
  right now, so a bead only ever paints inside space that was already there.
  Elsewhere a persistent bead reserves its own space and a transient one
  overlays inside the existing trailing inset.
- Focus rings are visible in every theme and do not rely on color alone.
- **A focused control shows exactly one accent line, and it is the ring.** The
  ring is drawn a border *inside* the plate; the perimeter keeps the quiet
  resting rim, including under the pointer, where a hover would otherwise lift
  it. Two accent lines with a plate-coloured gap between them read as a
  doubled border rather than as one mark, and the position of the single line
  is what tells focus from hover — not its colour. A rim carrying a *role* or a
  *disposition* (a destructive edge, a pending check) is that control's own
  statement and is never demoted for the ring.
- Destructive controls remain readable before and during confirmation.

### Plate seating: panel or bar

Where a control sits decides whether it wears chrome of its own. Seating is a
property of the *surface behind the control*, never of what the control is or
what it is doing, and it changes nothing else: one state model, one renderer,
and one resolved set of colours serve both seatings.

| Seating | Rendering |
|---|---|
| Panel | The control always wears its Alloy Plate and Signal Rim, so it reads as a plate raised above the window, dialog, or panel behind it. This is the default for every control. |
| Bar | The control wears **no** Signal Rim in any state, and no plate at all while it has nothing of its own to state. A run of icons therefore reads as one continuous bar instead of a row of boxed buttons. |

A bar-seated control is not a control with its feedback removed. Everything a
plated control would say on its edge, it says inside its own slot:

- **Hover** raises the plate as the shared pointer wash (`surface_hover`), one
  clear step away from the bar's own fill; **press** compresses it
  (`surface_pressed`). The wash is the *only* pointer feedback such a control
  has, which is why the theme owes it a visible step (§6).
- **Keyboard focus** keeps the resting fill and draws the ordinary focus ring
  inside the plate, so focus is never confused with hover and is never dropped.
- **A role colour** (a primary or recovery fill) still fills the plate; on an
  icon strip of peers, though, no single icon is "the" primary action, so a
  role fill is the exception rather than the rule there.
- **A disposition** — denied, failed-closed, pending, disabled — states itself
  on the glyph tint and on its shape-coded Signal Bead (§13, §15) instead of on
  a coloured edge, so it stays legible without colour vision.
- **Activity and pressure** state themselves on the marks a control already
  owns: the Heat Seam, the Pressure Rail, and the Signal Bead.
- **Focus Field membership** (§15) is the one signal a bar-seated control
  cannot make, because membership is drawn *only* as a lift of the rim. Nothing
  is lost: a Focus Field groups a row with its own actions inside a panel, and
  the icon strip has no such groups — a bar-seated control that holds the
  keyboard still draws the ring, which is the signal that matters.

Under a **high-contrast** theme a bar-seated control does not grow a rim back:
the strip's legibility is the theme's to strengthen, in the palette rather than
in code. Such a theme widens the gap between its bar fill and its
`surface_hover` / `surface_pressed` plates, exactly as it deepens every other
role; the shape-coded beads, marks, and the focus ring are unchanged
because none of them relies on an edge in the first place.

The icon strip — launchers, pinned shortcuts, running-task buttons, and the
status capsule — is bar-seated, and so are the window commands in a title bar
(§11.18). A toolbar inside a window is not: it sits on a panel and keeps its
plates.

### The ground says what a surface *is*

Two roles are grounds a control takes because of what it is rather than what
state it is in, and both go through the same `ground_fill` path every other
background does.

`document` is the ground a document's own content is drawn on: an editor's or
a terminal's page, an **editable** field's plate. The ground is the affordance,
so a field the user may type in reads as a page (white on a light appearance)
while a read-only one recesses onto the window ground to read as a value shown
rather than entered. Neither substitutes a plate the recipe put a *colour* on —
a disabled, denied, or failed-closed field is stating something there — which
is why the recipe answers whether its plate is a plain background rather than
each family guessing. A hovered field states nothing on that page: the pointer
over a text surface is the seat's own text cursor, and the rim still lifts.

`title_band` is the ground every title band is drawn on: a window's furniture
bar, and the band a menu or dialog plate is capped with (§11.18) — one role,
because a heading band *is* the title bar with no commands in it. A lit window
command resolves its authored translucency against this rather than the window
surface, because this is the ground it actually sits on.

### Surface ground: opaque, floating chrome, or a frosted window

Seating says what a control sitting *on* a surface wears. Its counterpart,
`SurfaceGround`, says what lies **under** the surface being drawn, and so
whether its backgrounds cover that or let it through. It rides on the theme a
surface is drawn with (`Theme::floating`, `Theme::frosted`), never on each
control: everything drawn on one surface then agrees without any of them being
told separately, and none can be forgotten and left an opaque patch.

| Ground | Backgrounds |
|---|---|
| Opaque | The palette's own colours, covering what is behind them. The default for every surface. |
| Floating | The same colours at the palette's chrome alphas (§6), over a backdrop the compositor blurs by `chrome_backdrop_blur`. The wallpaper and the windows behind read through as a wash of their colours. |
| Frosted | An application window cut from the same glass: its own ground at `chrome_alpha` over the same blur, everything laid on it — rows and plates alike — solid, so what the window shows never reads through to the desktop. The Switchboard and Settings are drawn this way. |

`Theme::backdrop_blur` is the blur a ground reads over — `0` when opaque,
`chrome_backdrop_blur` on either glass — so a surface's fills and the blur it
asks the compositor for are one answer. `ThemeRegistry::active_on` holds each
grounded form beside the active theme and drops them with it, which is the one
derivation both the session and a frosted window draw from.

A floating surface keeps whichever colour role it wears solid and takes only
the alpha, so every relationship the theme authored survives: the taskbar, a
menu plate and the tray readout ground in `surface_raised`, a panel in
`surface`, and a resting row — `surface` too — is therefore exactly its panel
rather than a patch on it. There are two alphas, and the raised one is *derived*
from the ground — half of what is left between it and solid — so raising the
chrome opacity cannot narrow the step to nothing:

| Layer | Floating | Frosted | What takes it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ChromeLayer::Ground` | `chrome_alpha` | `chrome_alpha` | The surface's own ground. |
| `ChromeLayer::Inlay` | `chrome_alpha` | solid | A background laid flush into that ground and read as part of it: a list row, a menu row, a sidebar entry, a scroll channel, a heading band. |
| `ChromeLayer::Plate` | `chrome_plate_alpha` | solid | A plate raised on it: a button, a text field, a page tab, a card, a settings group — furniture standing on the glass rather than a hole cut in it. |

A row takes the layer of what it sits on: rows on a surface's ground are
`Inlay`, and a setting row is `Plate`, part of the group card it is listed on.
A row tint is laid down, so a row on the wrong layer would punch its ground's
translucency through the card around it.

The choice belongs to whoever puts the surface on screen — the only party that
knows what is behind it. A frosted window is its own: it draws with the
registry's frosted form, and whatever it opens over its *own content* — a choice
list, a menu, a sheet — stands on that content rather than on the glass and is
drawn opaque, because laid down translucent it would show the desktop through
the window. On the desktop the session derives the floating form **once**
(`DesktopSession::floating_theme`, the registry's) and hands it to everything it
grounds in it: the taskbar, every popup the bar opens (the
program-library launcher, the hover window picker, the notification popover, and
the Switchboard capsule's readout), and every surface of an open menu chain —
every menu on the desktop is one (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` M5). One derivation is
what stops a runtime theme switch leaving a surface on the ground it had before.

Four rules keep the look honest:

- **A background is laid down, never composited.** A translucent fill
  composited over the pass beneath it comes back more opaque than the theme
  authored, and the surface frosts nothing. An opaque colour covers either way,
  so this is the ordinary path too rather than a second one for chrome: the
  same byte wherever the shape fully covers a pixel, and one rounding rather
  than two on an arc pixel.
- **Exactly one translucent fill per surface.** A second layer over the first —
  a header band over the plate it already covers — would compound into an
  opacity no theme authored, so a floating panel draws no header band and
  states its header with the rail and title it already has.
- **A mark is not a background.** Only backgrounds take a chrome alpha. A role
  fill, a highlighted command, a pressure rail, a bead, a control's own rim, and
  a focus ring stay solid, because they have to read against whatever wallpaper
  happens to be behind them — and every icon and label is drawn exactly as on an
  opaque surface. Legibility comes from the blurred backdrop, not from dimming
  what the surface is there to show.
- **A surface's own rim is part of that surface.** The edge of a floating
  surface takes the surface's layer, not a mark's solidity: it reads as the same
  glass one step lighter (one step darker on a light theme), which is the 1 px
  border the taskbar wears, rather than a hard line the wallpaper cannot reach
  through — and a solid card's edge is solid. `paint_surface_plate` is the one
  recipe that draws it, so the bar and every popup it opens state their edges
  alike.

Not every plate recipe reads the ground yet: a dialog's plate, a metric tile's,
a status pill's and a slider's groove are laid in their own colours. That is
right on an opaque ground and on a frosted window, whose plates are solid, and
wrong only on floating chrome, where none of them is drawn today; the layer each
takes there is decided with the first floating surface that seats one.

### Window furniture anatomy

The title bar's arrangement is fixed, not a theme value (§6, §11.18): a command cluster in each corner, the identity group left-justified in the span between them.

```text
WindowFrame
  FrameRim
  TitleBar
    LeadingCluster
      PutToBack
      Close
    IdentityGroup (left-justified; the band drags from it like any non-control pixel)
      ApplicationGlyph (optional)
      TitleText
    TrailingCluster
      Minimize
      SizeToggle
  ClientViewport
    ClientSurface
    VerticalScrollBar
    HorizontalScrollBar
    ScrollCorner or ResizeGrabber
```

### Required window-anatomy rules

- The title text truncates before it would reach a window control.
- Visible glyph size and pointer hit-target size are separate theme metrics; compact glyphs still receive a usable target.
- Hover, active, inactive, maximized, and attention states do not change the client origin or measured frame extents.
- A drawn ResizeGrabber's affordance never overlaps a scrollbar thumb. At a two-scrollbar junction, the corner cell belongs to the grabber or a neutral ScrollCorner. The window frame's resize *hit* zone is a separate thing and deliberately overlaps the client's outermost pixels (§11.17).
- Vertical and horizontal scrollbars are one behavioral component parameterized by orientation. Their separate names exist for layout, accessibility, and testing, not as duplicated implementations.
- Root-viewport scrollbar visibility follows one declared policy: reserved gutter or overlay. The policy must not switch while the pointer is captured or while doing so would move content under an active interaction.

## 11. Component Specifications

Every component in this section is a **first-class control that must be fully
implemented** (§1): each ships with all the states listed for it, its dark/light
theme coverage, its high-contrast and reduced-motion behaviour, its complete
pointer/keyboard/focus handling, and its §20 tests. No component here is a
placeholder, an optional extra, or a "minimal for now" core (`AGENTS.md` §27,
§2.19). A component that omits a specified state or behaviour is incomplete and
is a defect (§20, `AGENTS.md` §23).

### 11.1 Button

Buttons are Alloy Plates with a Signal Rim and optional Heat Seam.

| State | Rendering |
|---|---|
| Idle | Matte plate, quiet rim, readable label. |
| Hover | Plate wash plus edge brightening, no layout movement. |
| Pressed | Firm compression, darker inner plate, label stable. |
| Primary | Accent rim, no broad glow unless focused. |
| Recommended | Action Warmth on the leading or lower edge. |
| Destructive | Danger rim, deliberate press timing, confirmation-aware. |
| Working | Heat Seam on the lower edge. |
| Denied | Authority Mark and explanatory text through tooltip or inline caption. |

A button should not use a spinner unless the action itself owns the work. If the work belongs to another object, use a linked Heat Seam instead.

**Content seating.** A button standing on its own centres its content group. A
button in a *stack* of commands seats it against the plate's leading inset
instead (`Button::aligned(ContentAlign::Leading)`), so the icons and labels of
the whole stack line up and the stack reads as a list of commands rather than a
column of centred captions. A container that stacks buttons imposes that on the
items it is given — `ActionRail` does — so no caller has to remember it and two
stacks can never disagree.

### 11.2 IconButton

Icon buttons use the same state model as buttons. The icon must come from a theme-aware glyph source and must support high-contrast rendering.

The icon button is the one control that appears on both kinds of surface — a
window toolbar and the desktop's icon strip — so it carries its plate seating
(§10). Seating changes only how the plate is worn; the state model, hit
testing, and every signal the button reports are identical either way.

Persistent badges sit on the trailing top corner. Transient beads charge from the nearest rim and settle into the badge position.

### 11.3 SplitButton

A split button contains a primary action region and a disclosure region. The two regions share one plate but expose separate focus and pointer states. The Signal Rim belongs to the whole control; the Heat Seam belongs to the primary action when the primary action is running.

### 11.4 Toggle

Toggles snap between states like a powered contact.

- The track is the Alloy Plate.
- The thumb is a smaller raised plate.
- The active side glows through an accent contact, not through a large wash.
- A denied toggle remains in its previous state and shows an Authority Mark.
- A pending toggle uses a Heat Seam while the backing service confirms the change.

### 11.5 Checkbox and Radio

Checkboxes and radio buttons must not rely on color alone. Use shape and fill:

- Checkbox checked: filled square mark.
- Checkbox mixed: horizontal mark.
- Radio selected: center bead.
- Warning or denied state: rail or rim plus label text.
- A checkbox answers its own `measured_width` — box, gap and label — so a
  container seating several side by side (§11.41's flag set) sizes each from
  the figure the checkbox's own layout uses.

### 11.6 Slider

Sliders are measured controls with a rail, value track, thumb, and optional semantic markers.

- The active range uses the theme accent.
- Resource sliders may use semantic rails, such as disk or memory.
- Dragging updates visual state immediately but commits through the owning model.
- A privileged or bounded value displays a lock or cap marker at the constrained edge.
- **The interaction reports where it settled, distinctly from the values it
  took along the way.** A drag reports one value per pointer sample
  (`SliderAction::SetValue`) and one settle when it ends
  (`SliderAction::Settled`); a key step, being one whole interaction, settles
  at once. Every continuous control this specification covers owes its owner
  the same signal.
- **Durable work belongs on the settle alone** — a setting written, a document
  published, another process told. Acting on each value change means acting
  once per pointer sample, which is how a slider ends up wired to a disk write
  and its window frozen for the length of the drag (`AGENTS.md` §28.2, §28.3).
  An owner that wants live feedback applies the value to its model and
  repaints; that is not durable work and costs no I/O.
- **The knob is the theme's size, not the row's.** It is `slider_knob` across,
  centred on the groove wherever the slider is seated, a raised plate over a
  soft shadow with a dot of the track's colour at its heart that grows under a
  hover and tightens under a press. Its travel stops short of the ends by the
  knob and its focus ring, so the ring — drawn clear of the knob, not inside
  it — never leaves the control.
- **Stops and named ends.** A slider may take only a set of evenly spaced
  stops, each marked on the track in the colour of whichever side of the knob
  it is on; a drag moves between them and a key steps one. It may name its two
  ends — *Slow* and *Fast* — so a setting measured in a unit no reader thinks
  in reads in words; a press on a name takes the value to that end, and a slot
  too narrow for both names draws the track alone.

### 11.7 Progress

Progress is an instrument trace, not decoration.

- Known progress: Heat Seam or bar with a stable percentage/value label.
- Indeterminate progress: bounded moving trace, disabled by reduced motion.
- Completed: success bead and static completion line.
- Failed: recovery or warning rim with concise reason.

Progress surfaces should expose throughput or remaining work only when the source model provides typed values.

### 11.8 TextField and SearchField

Text fields use a quiet Alloy Plate with a clear focus ring.

- Validation state appears as a rim segment and inline message.
- Search fields may show active query state through a small leading seam.
- Denied or read-only fields must be visually distinct from disabled fields.
- Cursor, selection, and text rendering are theme-driven and DPI-scaled.

The family's credential member is the masked entry `SecretField`; a search
field has no masked mode, because a query is not a credential.

- Once a character is in, the field shows the console's secret-entry marker,
  `[input active.]` with its dots cycling on `lib/vt`'s cadence, and
  `[input complete]` once submitted. What it draws depends on neither the
  characters nor their count, so it leaks less than a row of beads would, and
  a desktop password field and a console prompt say the same thing.
- Editing is the line discipline's: characters append, Backspace erases the
  last, Enter submits, Escape cancels. There is no caret movement and no
  selection, and the first edit after a submission begins a new secret. A
  masked entry measures the same height as a plain field, shows its
  placeholder while empty, and keeps every other state rendering.
- The dots move on the owner's clock: each key arrives as a `Keystroke`
  stamped with the monotonic instant it was taken, the owner parks no later
  than the field's deadline and advances it on that wake, and containers fold
  their fields' deadlines. The animation freezes three seconds after the last
  key, and reduced motion arms no deadline at all.
- The bound exists so the buffer can reserve its worst-case capacity once and
  never reallocate while filling, which would strand a copy of the credential
  in a released block. Every path that discards buffer content, `Drop`
  included, erases the bytes first through the shared secret wipe, and a
  debug dump reports the character count instead of the content.
- The control offers no way to reveal the buffer.

### 11.9 ComboBox

A combo box is a field plus disclosure action. It uses the text field focus model and the menu model for expanded choices. Selection state belongs to the choice list, not to string parsing inside the control.

- **The list's placement is the control's, not each owner's.**
  `ComboBox::popup_rect` answers where an expanded list goes for a field and
  the surface it must fit in: below the field where there is room, flipped
  above where there is not, and never past an edge. It is the shared plate
  rule (§11.10's `plate_rect`) over the control's own popup size, so a
  drop-down in a footer opens upward without its owner knowing it is special,
  and no surface carries a placement copy of its own.

### 11.10 Menu and MenuItem

Menus are pinned command plates. They are not floating ornament.

- The menu plate uses elevated surface tokens.
- A plate rounds itself and casts a drop shadow. Its heading band's ground is part of the plate rather than a fill over it, and a first or last row's highlight, rail and focus ring follow the plate's corners, so nothing a plate draws reaches past its own silhouette and the compositor never cuts it a second time.
- Each menu item is a row control with label, optional icon, shortcut, and state.
- Dangerous items use a danger rim only on their item row.
- Disabled items show the reason when focused or inspected.
- Nested menus open from the row edge with a short anchor trace.

### 11.11 Toolbar and Toolstrip

Toolbars are containers for IconButtons, SplitButtons, fields, and grouped actions.

- Group boundaries use quiet vertical gutters.
- The active tool has a persistent accent rim or lower seam.
- Background work belonging to a tool appears as a Heat Seam on that tool, not across the full toolbar.
- **A strip never draws or hit-tests outside its own bounds.** A strip with
  room for every tool seats them from its leading edge. One without seats
  **whole tools only** and scrolls; a tool with no room has no rectangle at
  all, so paint and hit-test agree by construction and a press can never land
  on a tool nothing drew.
- **The offset is in whole tools**, held as a `ScrollModel` over a
  `ScrollRange { content: tools, viewport: seats, offset: first shown }` with
  `line_step = 1` — the crate's own "application records" unit. One scroll
  engine, so the clamp is the scrollbar's own.
- **The overflow affordances are reserved when the strip scrolls at all**, one
  tool slot at each end, whether or not either is currently drawn — so
  scrolling moves the tools and not the band they sit in, and one step moves
  exactly one tool. A strip wide enough for every tool reserves nothing. Each
  is **drawn and pressable only where there is something that way**, through
  the shared `paint_chevron` the scrollbar's end buttons use rather than a
  second glyph; a strip whose band seats no tool at all offers neither,
  because stepping it could not help (fail closed).
- **A press steps one tool; a held press auto-repeats** through
  `Toolbar::repeat`, driven by the owner's one-shot timer and event-driven
  wakeups, never a polling loop (§11.28's rule for the scrollbar, applied
  here). The cadence — `REPEAT_DELAY_NS` before the first repeat, then
  `REPEAT_INTERVAL_NS` — is defined **once** in `lib/controls`'s scroll module
  and shared by every press-and-hold stepping control, so two held controls in
  one window cannot step at different rates. The wheel over the strip scrolls
  it, and a keyboard focus move scrolls the tool it lands on into view, so the
  keyboard reaches every tool however narrow the strip is.
- **An owner sizes its window from the strip, not from a guess.**
  `Toolbar::natural_width` is what seating every tool costs — the floor for an
  owner whose strip must never scroll — and `Toolbar::min_width` is the two
  reserved slots plus the widest single tool, the floor for one whose strip
  may. Neither is a hand-picked constant (§24.1).
- A held affordance draws the same as an idle one, so the press latch is
  **not** part of the render-equivalence comparison; the offset is.

### 11.12 Tabs

Tabs use a lower seam for selected state.

- Selected tab: strong lower seam and clear label weight.
- Modified tab: small Signal Bead.
- Loading tab: Heat Seam on lower edge.
- Error tab: warning or recovery bead with accessible label.
- The hovered tab and the keyboard-cursor tab are separate records: both lift
  their plate, only the cursor's is ringed, and each may rest on a different
  tab. A host may therefore re-state where its keyboard is as often as its
  model refreshes without disturbing where the pointer is.
- A strip whose labels carry a live reading is re-labelled in place, never
  rebuilt: a fresh strip knows neither record, nor where the pointer is, nor
  which tab a press is waiting on.
- A strip whose *entries* come and go is restated in place for the same
  reason, through the strip's own `restate`. Where the pointer is survives
  whatever the entries became — it is a fact about the reader's hand, not a
  claim about the sample. The hover and the press latch each name one entry,
  so they survive an unchanged run of entries and are dropped when the run
  gains, loses or re-orders one: a click that cannot be placed must do
  nothing, never select the entry that slid under the pointer. A host that
  replaces the strip instead swallows the click a reader is resting to make
  and blinks the lift off once per sample.

**The vertical strip is a sidebar list, not a column of tab shapes.** Its
selection, focus, keyboard and action model are the horizontal strip's, whole;
what differs is the anatomy an entry needs to name a *destination* rather than
a page:

- **An entry's label leads and its reading trails on that same line**, and an
  optional bounded trend (§11.35) draws beneath — so a rail of devices is a
  live summary of everything it selects between, not just a list of names. The
  reading keeps the room it needs and the label gives way first, elided with
  the shared mark, exactly as a MetricTile's inline layout does (§11.33).
- **Entries may carry a quiet group heading.** A heading is declared by the
  entry that *starts* the group, so it can never point at an entry that is not
  there. It draws with no plate, selects nothing, and hit-tests to nothing.
- **A vertical strip stacks; it does not split.** Each entry claims its own
  content height — so an entry with no rate behind it is visibly shorter than
  one carrying a trace, and the absence of the instrument is what says so —
  and the strip states the height its whole list wants. Every entry is laid
  out at that height however long the list is, and a list longer than the
  column is its **owner's to scroll**: a discovered list (a hundred cores, a
  dozen volumes) is never squeezed below the height an entry needs to draw its
  own label, nor truncated.
- **A horizontal strip draws none of the three.** One row has no line for a
  reading beneath a label and no room for an instrument, and a heading has no
  meaning across a row; a horizontal tab's reading belongs in its label. The
  strip therefore draws identically with or without them rather than crowding
  its own label with anatomy it cannot seat.
- **Damage.** A moved selection or keyboard cursor reports the two entries it
  moved between, never the strip; a scrolled owner reports what of them
  shows. Because a vertical entry's rectangle depends on the theme's own
  metrics, the hit test and every damage-reporting entry point take the scale
  and theme the strip was laid out with — the same shape ActionRail (§11.38)
  already has, so a press can never select an entry drawn at another span.
- **Selection is a lift and a leading rail, and a sidebar entry wears no focus
  ring.** A row already has two marks for selection — it lifts to the raised
  fill, and its *leading* edge takes the accent at the shared rail breadth, the
  same rail every row family draws. The pointer and the keyboard cursor share
  the hover wash instead, which §11.13 already keeps distinct from that raised
  fill, so a cursor can never imitate selection. A ring as well would be a
  third mark on the same entry and the loudest thing in the column, so the
  vertical strip draws none; the selected entry's *label* stays the plain
  foreground for the same reason, leaving the reading beside it and the label
  reading alike. A resting entry is simply the ground it sits on.
  A horizontal tab has neither a lift nor a leading rail — it is a page shape,
  and its selected edge is the lower seam at the seam breadth — so it keeps
  both the accent label and the ring that tells its keyboard cursor from a
  hover. A group heading reads in the accent at the header role's size in
  either form, so a break in the list is never taken for one more entry.
- **The keyboard cursor belongs to the reader, not to the host's selection.**
  `Tabs::restate` carries it across a refresh alongside the pointer's hover and
  press latch, under the same rule: kept while the run of entries is the same
  run, dropped when one is gained, lost or re-ordered. A host that re-derived
  it from its own selection each sample would light a ring on the selected
  entry permanently and snap a reader's cursor back the moment a live reading
  moved.
- **A list longer than its column is the owner's to scroll, in pixels.** The
  owner lays the whole strip out unscrolled and shows it through a scrolled
  view (§11.28), which clips and shifts the paint and maps the pointer and the
  damage both ways; an entry the column's edge crosses is drawn cut and still
  answers where it shows. The strip holds no scroll position of its own.
- **An entry may lead with an icon, and the owner resolves the picture.**
  `Tab::with_icon` names the kind; the strip resolves it through the owner's
  icon lookup at the one slot side it paints at (`Tabs::icon_side`, the
  theme's `sidebar_icon_extent`), so a strip of icons costs a cache lookup per
  entry rather than re-rasterising vector art every frame. The icon is taller
  than the label's line of text, because a sidebar is found by its icons
  before its labels are read, so a strip carrying icons seats every entry — a
  disclosed page included — on one row tall enough for the icon and a control
  gap's clearance. Room is claimed in the order a reader needs it — the Signal
  Bead, then the disclosure chevron and the reading, then the icon, then the
  label, which is what gives way, elided with the shared mark — so an entry
  too narrow for its icon keeps its name rather than becoming a nameless
  indent, and a cut name never reads as a complete one.
- **A sidebar list may be two levels deep, and it is still one column.** An
  entry that holds pages of its own carries a trailing disclosure chevron
  stating *its own* posture (`Tab::with_disclosure`): down while its pages are
  shown, right while they are not. Each page is an ordinary entry declared
  nested (`Tab::nested`), indented by exactly one icon slot so it lines up
  with the label of the entry that disclosed it. One cursor therefore walks
  the whole column, every row is hit-tested and selectable, and no index means
  anything special. What *choosing* a disclosing entry does is the owner's —
  the strip states the posture and nothing more — which is what lets one strip
  hold a list whose sections both select a view and open their pages. The
  indent is part of a strip's entry identity, so restating a flat list as a
  nested one drops the hover and press latch like any other re-shaping.
- **A two-level list answers the tree keys.** Right on a closed disclosing
  entry and Left on an open one report `TabsAction::Disclose` — the owner
  applies it, since the strip holds no posture of its own — and Right on an
  open entry steps onto its first page, Left on a page climbs back to the
  entry that disclosed it. An entry that refuses a press refuses them too.
  They are a vertical strip's alone: Left and Right stay a horizontal strip's
  cursor keys. The step is one definition beside `DisclosureSet`
  (`tree_step`), which the program library's folders answer by as well.
- **Sections open independently — the desktop's rule for every list.** Opening
  one section never closes another, in any list whose sections open in place:
  a list that shut the section a reader was in as they opened the next would
  throw away where they had got to. `DisclosureSet` is the one model of that
  (every section starts open or closed and moves on its own), and every such
  list keeps one rather than an accordion policy of its own — the Settings
  sidebar, the program library's folders.
- **A group may be set apart by a break rather than a heading.**
  `Tab::with_group_break` puts a blank band half an entry's line tall above
  the entry that starts a group, for a list whose runs a reader recognises
  without their being named. Like a heading it is declared by the entry that
  starts the group, draws nothing, selects nothing and shifts no index; one
  with nothing above it draws nothing (as a menu's group break does), and a
  horizontal strip draws none. The layout and the measured height read one
  walk of the stack, so the height an owner reserves is the height laid out.
  A break is part of the entry identity, like the indent.
- **Settle point.** A strip has none of its own: selection is a discrete
  commit (`TabsAction::Selected`) the owner applies, and re-stating a reading
  or a trend is a repaint, never a durable action.

### 11.13 ListRow and TableRow

Rows are controls. They can be selected, focused, inspected, dragged, or linked to actions.

- Hover uses the shared pointer wash (`surface_hover`), which is deliberately
  *not* the raised fill a selected row lifts to — the pointer never imitates
  selection.
- Selection uses a left rail plus background tint.
- Live activity uses a Heat Seam at the bottom of the row.
- Resource pressure uses a semantic rail on the leading edge.
- Recovery state uses a sharper bead or latch affordance.

Tables must keep columns aligned while row state changes. Both the leading
rail gutter and the trailing Signal Bead band are therefore reserved from the
row's own size alone, never from its current state, and a header reserves the
identical span so its titles name exactly the spans the cells beneath occupy.
A composer that must place its own content inside a column (a sparkline beside
a number) reads the row's laid-out cell rectangles rather than re-deriving the
layout, so the two can never disagree.

### 11.14 TableCell

A table cell may expose its own state only when that state is cell-specific. Row-wide state belongs to the row. Numeric cells should use a tabular numeric font role when available.

A cell may carry an optional leading icon naming what its value *is* — the same
optional identity icon a metric tile already carries on its own leading edge,
never a second convention. It draws on a fixed slot ahead of the text whatever
the cell's alignment, out of the text's own budget so it can never overlap it,
and a column too narrow to seat it omits it rather than crowding the text. An
icon is content within a cell: it never moves a column boundary.

### 11.15 Card

Cards group state and actions.

- The leading edge carries the dominant state.
- The bottom edge carries progress.
- The top trailing corner carries count or alert beads.
- Footer actions share the card's semantic state but keep their own pointer and focus states.
- A card is itself pressable, so a master list of cards is selectable with the
  pointer. A completed primary click inside the card's bounds that no footer
  button consumed reports `CardAction::Pressed`; a completed click on a footer
  button reports `CardAction::FooterActivated` instead. The footer buttons see
  every pointer event first, so one click never reports both.
- A press gives the card **no** pointer look of its own. The feedback for
  choosing a card is the owner marking it *selected* — the composed state is
  the owner's to set — so the body pointer position and press latch are
  hit-test input only and are excluded from render equality: a card mid-press
  compares equal to its resting self and draws the same pixels.
- A card that is not actionable (disabled, or denied by authority) reports
  nothing for a body press, through the same fail-closed press latch every
  clickable control shares, so there is one rule rather than a card-specific
  one.
- A card's plate bounds the group it owns. One item of an icon view is not such
  a group and carries no plate: that is an `IconTile` (§11.34), never a card
  with an icon.

### 11.16 Panel

Panels are containers with stable layout. A panel may have a Focus Field, header state, grouped actions, and scrollable content. A panel opening from a taskbar or tray item should retain an anchor notch or route line to its invoker while open.

### 11.17 WindowFrame

A `WindowFrame` is the window-manager-owned boundary around one client viewport.

- The Frame Rim is one quiet neutral at every activation, a single step away from the window surface. It is the line the eye reads a window's shape by, so it never brightens on focus: a rim that did made the boundary the loudest mark on the desktop and left every unfocused window reading as switched off.
- Focus is shown inside the frame instead, by the title bar's stronger title contrast, and under high contrast by a non-color distinction as well — a doubled inner rim line, which follows the plate's own corners, or a title-weight change.
- **The rim is bevelled by the desktop's one key light, at the upper left.** A ring as wide as the frame border is lifted by `bevel_light` where the edge faces the light and deepened by `bevel_shade` where it faces away, turning through each corner with the edge's own direction. The washes are translucent, so they say which way an edge faces without changing its tone. The rim is the title band's top and sides as well, so the band adds only its foot — one border deep in `bevel_shade` where it meets the client, laid after the bar's marks so it runs unbroken under a lit command — and every bevel line is one border wide, never two side by side.
- A restored window casts a drop shadow onto what lies beneath it; a maximized or fullscreen one casts none, because it fills the area it was given.
- The inactive frame is structurally identical and equally legible; only its title contrast is quieter.
- An attention request adds a bounded Signal Bead or rim segment. It does not steal focus and does not pulse indefinitely.
- Client pixels are clipped to the client viewport and never paint into the title bar, borders, root scrollbars, or resize grabber.
- **Client pixels are clipped to the frame's rounded plate, so content can never square off the window's corner.** A client's rows are square and the frame's silhouette is a curve, so the compositor cuts the client to the plate the frame fills inside its rim: a pixel the plate does not fully cover is the frame's, whose rim and plate *are* the curve there. The top and bottom furniture strips reach at least the rim's radius so a corner row is drawn as furniture over its whole width — the one place furniture and client share a row, and never further in than the radius.
- **The title bar draws no ground of its own.** The frame has already laid its plate, rounded, under the whole window; a band fill would square off the very corners the rim curves around, in the colour that is already there.
- Frame activation, theme change, and hover do not change the client origin or outer dimensions.
- Maximized geometry uses the session work area and therefore respects taskbars, reserved screen edges, and the current logical scale.
- The furniture band on the left, right, and bottom edges is the thin frame rim, whether or not the window is resizable. A band wide enough to grab is not reserved: it would show as dead space around the content on every resizable window.
- A resizable window's resize *hit* zone therefore reaches inward over the client's own outermost pixels, by the theme's invisible hit slop — the invisible resize border macOS, GNOME, and Windows use. The application still draws every client pixel; it does not receive presses on the few it trades for a grabbable edge, and where it declares root-viewport furniture the frame's zone takes that outer strip first. A non-resizable window trades nothing: every client pixel reaches it.
- Drawing stays strictly separated even so: the frame paints no furniture mark inside the client, and the client paints no furniture.
- The frame owns the hit map for move, resize, command buttons, and any root-viewport scrollbars.

### 11.18 TitleBar

The title bar combines application identity, title text, a stable drag region, and the window commands.

- The four commands sit in **two corner clusters**, not one group: `PutToBack` then `Close` inset into the leading corner, `Minimize` then `SizeToggle` inset into the trailing one. That left-to-right order is also the keyboard traversal order, so an arrow key moves the focus ring the way the eye reads. Placement and order are fixed, never a theme value (§6).
- The identity icon and title text are one group, **left-justified in the span the clusters leave between them**: the icon one gap past the leading cluster, the text after it. The group therefore starts in the same place whatever the title says and however wide the window is, so the eye finds it without hunting.
- The title text uses a single line. A group too wide for the span keeps its leading edge and truncates the tail with an ellipsis on the right; it never overlaps a control.
- The identity icon is drawn **desaturated by activation**: it keeps nearly all its colour on the active frame and none of it on an inactive one, so an unfocused window's icon reads as quiet as its muted title. One shared saturation reduction does it as the artwork lands, so the owner still caches one full-colour icon per (bundle, pixel side).
- Everything in the band that is not a control drags the window — the identity slot and the title text included — so the drag region does not have to be reserved against the text.
- Pressing an inactive title bar activates the window. Movement beyond the theme drag threshold begins a move and captures the pointer until release or cancel.
- A title-bar drag follows the pointer without easing. Snap previews may appear as container-owned overlays without moving the pointer target.
- A double-click or equivalent gesture may invoke `SizeToggle` only when session policy enables it. The explicit size-toggle button remains required. **Implemented**: two primary presses on a window's title bar within the seat's published double-click interval report `WindowControl { SizeToggle }` and start no move-grab; the pairing is the shared `tairix_input::DoubleClickTracker` keyed on the window id, and a press anywhere but a title bar in between breaks the pair.
- The title bar exposes the application name and current window title to accessibility tools even when the visible title is truncated.
- Window titles are untrusted application data: the window manager bounds their length, renders them as plain text, rejects or replaces control characters, and applies the text engine's directional-isolation rules rather than interpreting markup.
- Attention state is shown with a bounded bead or rim segment, not a decorative loop.

#### Shared window-control states

The close, minimize, put-to-back, and size-toggle controls are compact `WindowControl` instances built from the shared `IconButton` behavior.

A window command is **bar-seated** (§6): no perimeter of its own in any state, and no plate at all while it rests. An edge on a command would read as a line drawn round the window's corner rather than as feedback on a button.

| State | Rendering and behavior |
|---|---|
| Idle, active frame | No plate: the readable glyph alone on the bar's own surface. |
| Idle, inactive frame | Lower contrast than the active frame while remaining legible. |
| Hover | The plate lifts to the shared hover wash — lighter on a dark theme, darker on a light one, by the amount every other control moves — without changing title-bar geometry. |
| Pressed | Firm compression and captured press state until release or cancel. |
| Keyboard focus | Visible focus ring distinct from hover and window activation. |
| Disabled | Muted plate and glyph, no command dispatch, and an inspectable reason. |

Pressing a window control on an inactive frame activates that frame and arms the same control in one interaction. Releasing over the armed control invokes it; moving away or cancelling does not. The press is never forwarded into the client surface.

### 11.19 CloseButton

The close button represents `WindowControlKind::Close` and is not a force-termination control.

- Activation sends a typed cooperative close request to the owning application.
- The application may close immediately, reject the request with a user-facing reason, or present an unsaved-work decision surface while keeping the window open.
- A non-responsive application remains a recovery case. `Force Action` or process termination uses the separate destructive recovery path and its capability checks.
- The close glyph and accessible label identify `Close <window title>`. A theme may use danger emphasis on hover or press, but the idle button need not appear permanently destructive.
- A non-closable surface retains the control slot and renders it disabled with an explanation. Close availability must not shift neighboring title-bar controls.

### 11.20 MinimizeButton

The minimize button represents `WindowControlKind::Minimize`.

- Activation removes the window from the current workspace view while keeping the application, task, and background work alive.
- The corresponding taskbar item remains available and exposes the minimized state. Restoring through the taskbar returns the same window rather than creating a new one.
- The restored rectangle is preserved independently of the maximized rectangle.
- A minimize transition may route visually toward the taskbar when motion is enabled. Reduced-motion mode changes state immediately without a travel animation.
- Minimize is distinct from `PutToBack`: minimized windows are hidden from the workspace; put-to-back windows remain visible when not covered.

### 11.21 PutToBackButton

The put-to-back button represents `WindowControlKind::PutToBack`.

- Activation moves the window to the bottom of the normal stacking order for its current workspace and activates the next eligible window.
- The window remains mapped, visible where not occluded, and represented by the same taskbar item. Its process and jobs are unaffected.
- The glyph uses stacked plates with a backward or downward cue, and the accessible label is `Put window to back`.
- Modal ownership, pinned system surfaces, or session policy may disable the action. The disabled state explains the constraint.
- Repeated activation is idempotent once the window is already at the back of its allowed stack.

### 11.22 SizeToggleButton

The size-toggle button represents `WindowControlKind::SizeToggle`.

- In `WindowSizeState::Restored`, the glyph and accessible label describe the next action: `Maximize`.
- In `WindowSizeState::Maximized`, the glyph and accessible label describe the next action: `Restore`.
- Maximize fills the current session work area, not the physical display bounds, and is not fullscreen. Fullscreen is `WindowSizeState::Fullscreen`, reached only by the owning application asking over the window channel; the toggle offers Maximize and Restore and nothing else, and is not rendered at all while the window is fullscreen (`plans/COMPOSITOR-WORK.md` Stage J).
- Restore returns to the saved logical rectangle. If the work area, scale, or display arrangement changed, the window manager revalidates and clamps that rectangle so a usable title bar remains reachable.
- Fixed-size or otherwise non-resizable windows render the control disabled with a concise reason.
- The transition preserves client content and scroll position. Reduced-motion mode uses an immediate geometry change.

### 11.23 ResizeGrabber

The resize grabber is the corner resize gesture. A window frame's resize zone is invisible — it overlaps the client's outermost pixels rather than reserving a visible band (§11.17) — so the window frame draws no corner affordance; a host that has room for one, such as a scrollbar junction, may still draw its Grip Teeth.

- Where one is drawn it appears at the logical bottom-trailing corner and uses Grip Teeth or another shape mark that remains visible without color.
- Its visible size and pointer hit region are separate. The hit region may extend invisibly into the frame and, on a window frame, into the client's own outer pixels, but never into another control or scrollbar thumb.
- Press and drag capture the pointer until release or cancel. Geometry follows the pointer on the next frame with no easing.
- The window manager enforces typed minimum, maximum, aspect, and work-area constraints before presenting each new rectangle.
- When both root scrollbars are visible, the grabber owns their junction cell. A non-resizable window uses a neutral `ScrollCorner` there instead.
- Maximized and non-resizable windows hide or disable the grabber consistently with the active theme.
- A keyboard resize command remains available through the window or system menu, so resize does not depend on precise pointer use.
- Frame edges may also expose resize zones, but they share this same constraint, cursor, pointer-capture, and test model rather than implementing a second resize path.

### 11.24 Dialog

Dialogs are decision surfaces.

- The primary action is visually warm only when it is the recommended safe action.
- Destructive actions use a Recovery Latch or deliberate confirmation step.
- Disabled actions explain why through inline copy or a focused explanation.
- Dialogs must not hide capability denial behind generic disabled state.

### 11.25 Notification

Notifications use cards with semantic beads. They should remain compact and actionable.

- Informational: quiet rim.
- Background job: Heat Seam.
- Warning: warning rail.
- Recovery available: recovery bead and clear action.
- Denied action: Authority Mark with source application or service name.

### 11.26 TaskbarItem and WindowPreview

The desktop's icon bar shows **applications**, and its hover picker shows one
application's **windows**. Those are two controls, because they answer two
different questions.

#### TaskbarItem — one application

A taskbar item combines application identity (the icon), activity, and
attention on one Alloy Plate. It is **bar seated** (§10): an item wears no
Signal Rim, and rests with no plate at all, so a strip of applications reads
as one bar and every state is stated inside the slot.

Every item draws one centred icon filling the plate (`icon_content_side`), so
a run of applications reads as one strip of equal icons rather than a row of
captions. The item carries no text at all: an application's label lives in the
bar's own model, which is what a context surface — a menu, a tooltip — reads.

**It states no window state at all.** A slot is an application, not a window,
so there is no presence mark, no focus seam, and no recessed minimised plate:
whether a window is focused or hidden is a fact about a *window*, and the
picker below is where windows are shown. What remains is the pointer's own
hover and press wash, keyboard focus, the Heat Seam for background work, and
the top-trailing Signal Bead for an attention request or a recovery/denied
state.

The item draws its identity from a built-in class glyph tinted for the
resolved frame, or from **owner-supplied artwork** (pre-rasterised pixels).
The control never parses image bytes; [`icon_side`] exposes the exact pixel
geometry (sized off the text line for labelled items, or the plate for
icon-only items) so owners rasterise at exactly the drawn size.

#### WindowPreview — one window

A window preview is one cell of the picker an icon-bar slot opens: a captioned
thumbnail of a single window. Where a `TaskbarItem` is one application, a
preview is one *window* of it — so this is the surface that names a window,
and the caption is the window's own title.

The thumbnail is a scaled copy of that window's last presented frame,
pre-rasterised by the owner at [`thumbnail_bounds`], exactly as every other
control takes owner-supplied artwork: a control never scales a live surface on
a paint path, and never parses image bytes. A window with no thumbnail yet —
one that has not presented, or whose pixels the owner released under memory
pressure — draws its application's class glyph in the thumbnail's place, so a
cell can never come up blank.

Equal previews draw the same pixels, so a picker may use `==` as its repaint
gate: the caption, the glyph, and the visible state compare, while the pointer
coordinate and the press latch do not.

#### MenuMark — a menu row's state

A menu row states an independent setting or a chosen alternative with a
**mark** in the leading icon column ([`MenuMark`]: none, a tick, or a filled
bullet). A row states either an icon or a mark, never both: they share the one
reserved column, so a mark replaces the icon rather than crowding it, and a
marked row's label still lines up with an unmarked one's. Both are shapes
rather than colours, so the state is legible without colour vision.

### 11.27 TraySignal

A tray signal is a compact live status capsule. Like every other icon on the
strip it is **bar seated** (§10): the always-rightmost system control point
wears no rim and rests with no plate, so it reads as part of the bar and states
itself entirely through its own marks — its badge, beads, seam, and rail.

- Normal: calm glyph on the bar, no rim and no plate.
- Background work: lower Heat Seam.
- Pressure: side rail in semantic role.
- Recovery: recovery bead.
- Multiple states: stacked mini beads, ordered by severity.
- As built, live badge: an optional top-trailing filled count/alert badge —
  a count capped at "9+", or an exclamation mark for a countless urgent
  state (a hung app) — toned accent (background job), warning (pressure),
  danger (hung, the destructive role's red), or recovery. It shares the one
  badge painter with the §11.25 card count badge; the mini-bead stack starts
  after it, hiding nothing.

A tray signal expands to an instrument readout on hover or focus. The readout must be short: state name, count or value, and primary safe action.

### 11.28 ScrollBar Common Behavior

Vertical and horizontal scrollbars are one orientation-parameterized control. Window-level and embedded variants share the same range validation, thumb math, input behavior, focus model, and theme values.

```text
ScrollBar
  DecrementButton
  TrackBeforeThumb
  Thumb
  TrackAfterThumb
  IncrementButton
```

- The thumb length is proportional to `viewport_extent / content_extent`, subject to the theme's minimum thumb length and the space required by end controls.
- The thumb position maps the clamped `offset` across the draggable track. The same mapping is used in paint, hit testing, keyboard updates, and tests.
- When the viewport covers the content, the offset is zero and the bar follows the declared layout policy: hidden, or a reserved quiet gutter with a non-draggable thumb. It must not oscillate between policies as content changes by a pixel.
- Idle: low-contrast thumb and quiet Scroll Channel.
- Hover, keyboard focus, wheel input, or active scrolling: thumb and relevant end control brighten without changing geometry.
- Thumb drag captures the pointer and preserves the initial pointer-to-thumb anchor so the content does not jump when the drag begins.
- A decrement or increment control performs one typed line step. A track region performs one page step in its direction. Press-and-hold repetition uses a one-shot timer and event-driven wakeups, never a polling loop.
- Mouse wheel, touchpad, keyboard, and accessibility actions update the same scroll model. The control does not maintain a private offset separate from the owning viewport.
- **A view scrolls by pixels.** Its content is laid out at its natural size and the viewport rests at any pixel of it; an item the viewport's edge crosses is drawn whole and cut by the edge, never squeezed into what shows or dropped. The line step is the view's own row pitch, and a page is the viewport less one line, so a page turn keeps the last line it showed.
- **One scrolled view maps the content and the window.** Paint is confined to the viewport and shifted by the offset, so no item is ever drawn at a negative coordinate; a window point maps into the layout for hit testing and a layout rectangle maps back to the part that shows for damage. Lines are placed at their absolute content coordinate, so content taller than `i32::MAX` pixels loses its end: `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D327. A pointer outside the viewport keeps its place across the scrolling axis and stands just before the content's start along it, so no control can hover or arm the part scrolled out of sight while a drag across the axis — a slider in a scrolling column — keeps following it.
- **A wheel detent moves a fixed distance.** Input arrives in scroll units, a fixed number to a detent, already accelerated by the seat from how fast the wheel is turning across separate drains (a busy session reading several detents at once is not a fast spin). A view moves the same number of logical pixels a detent whatever its rows are, carrying what is short of a whole pixel into the next turn; a reversal drops the carry. A strip that scrolls in whole tools steps one tool a detent on the same carry.
- **A wheel over the bar scrolls it**, as it does over the content, and a scroll repaints the bar with the content it slid.
- If content extent changes during thumb drag, the control recomputes the range from the preserved drag anchor, clamps the result, and never produces an invalid offset.
- Content updates do not animate the thumb unless the user is actively looking at or manipulating the scrollbar. Reduced-motion mode uses immediate position changes.
- A focused scrollbar supports arrow keys for line steps, Page Up or Page Down for page steps, and Home or End for the range bounds, interpreted by orientation.

### 11.29 VerticalScrollBar

A vertical scrollbar controls the viewport's vertical offset.

- It sits on the logical trailing edge by default. A right-to-left session policy may mirror it to the leading edge without changing command meaning.
- The decrement control means `Scroll up`; the increment control means `Scroll down`.
- The thumb moves only on the vertical axis, and its accessible value reports the vertical position and range.
- Vertical wheel or touchpad input routes to the nearest eligible vertical viewport under the existing input-routing rules.
- Edge Wake may appear on the top or bottom client edge to show that more content exists beyond the viewport.

### 11.30 HorizontalScrollBar

A horizontal scrollbar controls the viewport's horizontal offset.

- It sits on the logical bottom edge by default.
- The decrement control means `Scroll toward the logical start`; the increment control means `Scroll toward the logical end`. Glyph direction mirrors with layout direction while accessible names remain semantic.
- The thumb moves only on the horizontal axis, and its accessible value reports the horizontal position and range.
- Horizontal touchpad input and any session-defined modified-wheel gesture route to the nearest eligible horizontal viewport.
- Edge Wake may appear on the leading or trailing client edge to show off-screen content.

### 11.31 ScrollCorner

A `ScrollCorner` occupies the junction between visible vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

- On a resizable top-level window it is replaced by, or visually integrated with, the `ResizeGrabber` while retaining one unambiguous hit target.
- On a non-resizable window it is a neutral Alloy Plate with no hidden scroll or resize action.
- It never overlaps either thumb and never receives line-step or page-step input intended for a scrollbar track.

### 11.32 Tooltip and HelpTip

Tooltips explain immediate affordance. HelpTips explain why an action is unavailable or recommended.

- Tooltips are short and anchored.
- A tooltip plate rounds itself and casts a drop shadow like every other floating surface.
- HelpTips may include one reason and one safe next step.
- Security-sensitive denial text must avoid secrets and capability tokens.

### 11.33 MetricTile

A metric tile is the at-a-glance readout of one resource: an optional
leading identity icon, a quiet label, a bold reading with a quieter unit
beside it, an optional line of supporting detail, and an optional
instrument beneath — a proportional track, or a Chart (§11.35) of the
resource's recent history. It is a read-only instrument with no pointer or
keyboard handling, alongside Slider (§11.6) and Progress (§11.7) in the
value/measured family; the owner supplies every visible fact and
re-renders when any of them changes.

- **The track is the design language's one reading-with-a-track.** It is
  always tinted by the resource's own semantic rail colour (CPU, memory,
  disk, network, power, or thermal), never the plain accent: unlike Slider
  or Progress, the track's colour is the resource's fixed identity, not a
  transient severity, so a CPU tile's track reads as the compute colour
  whether it is showing 5% or 95%.
- The Pressure Rail's severity state still drives emphasis exactly as it
  does for Card (§12.3): at rest the track is plain and tinted, and under
  genuine pressure it gains the same rail emphasis outline a card's leading
  edge would show. This is not a second severity vocabulary — it is the one
  Pressure Rail state, read by one more control.
- Unmeasured state: a resource with no wired query or a denied capability
  renders the quiet unmeasured track and whatever reading text its owner
  supplies (e.g. an em dash), never a fabricated `0%`.
- A track reports the resource *now*. What it has been doing over time is a
  Chart (§11.35), a different instrument with a different shape, and the two
  never report the same number at once: a band that plots a resource's
  history puts the chart in the slot the track would have taken.
- A tile draws in one of two layouts: stacked, the default, with the label
  above the reading for a tile that owns a column of its own; or inline,
  with the label leading and the reading (kept whole; the label gives way
  first, elided) trailing on one line, for a stack of readings scanned down a
  narrow column. Either way the optional detail line and instrument still
  span the tile's full width.
- A tile is plated by default; an unplated tile draws no plate, rim, or
  padding of its own, for several readings sharing one container's surface
  — a Panel (§11.16) — without nesting a plate inside a plate.
- A metric tile narrower or shorter than its own icon, label, reading,
  detail, and instrument degrades by omitting the instrument, then the
  detail line, never by drawing past its own bounds.
- **The reading's *value* may name its own text role**, defaulting to Body.
  A hero reading leads with a loud figure against a quiet unit, so the two are
  not one face — but they are still one *line*, aligned on the baseline they
  share rather than on their own line boxes, which would leave the unit
  floating at the figure's cap. The tile names a `TextRole` and the theme
  answers with the face: a control never accepts a typeface. The line box is
  the tallest ascent over the deepest descent of the pair, and the tile's own
  `reading_height` / `measured_height` / `icon_side` grow with it, so an owner
  placing content beneath a hero never has to know which role it chose.

A StatusPill is a compact, read-only capsule that names a condition —
"Healthy", "Denied", "Recovering" — with no action of its own, toned by the
theme's own signal roles exactly as a Pressure Rail or Signal Bead of that
role is elsewhere. It fills the gap neither a metric tile nor any other
control covers: badging a state without offering a button.

- **A resting pill collapses its rim onto its fill; an *outlined* one draws it
  in its own tone.** A pill sitting alone in a row of prose says enough with a
  wash and a label. A pill *badging* a dense grid — a core's performance class
  in the corner of its cell — has no such room: the wash is a few levels off
  the plate it sits on and reads as nothing, so the rim is what makes the badge
  a badge. The heavier-contrast themes already rim every pill, so asking for a
  rim there changes nothing rather than doubling it.

### 11.34 IconTile

An `IconTile` is one item of an icon view: a picture with its name beneath it.
It is the tile a file manager's icon view and the desktop's icon field are made
of, and it is a collection control alongside ListRow/TableRow (§11.13) and Card
(§11.15).

- **A resting tile has no plate, rim, or rail of its own.** It paints only its
  picture and its label over whatever lies behind it — a window's surface, or
  the desktop wallpaper — so a folder reads as a field of pictures rather than a
  grid of boxes. A tile is not a Card: a card's plate bounds a group it owns,
  while a plate per item would draw a box around every icon.
- Only *state* paints anything behind the picture:
  - Hover and press take the shared pointer wash (`surface_hover` /
    `surface_pressed`) as a rounded panel across the whole tile.
  - **Selection frosts the tile's backdrop and fills the tile with the theme's
    `selection_fill`** — its own accent at three tenths opacity, light because
    the frost is what marks the item and the accent only tints it. What is
    blurred is the *backdrop*: the pixels the tile covers — a window's surface,
    the desktop wallpaper — are frosted by the scaled `selection_backdrop_blur`
    through the one shared region frost, the same call the compositor frosts a
    window's
    backdrop with, and the fill is then laid over them with a **crisp** edge,
    rounded like every other panel. Frost and fill are both confined to that
    one rounded shape, so nothing escapes the tile and no square edge shows
    around the rounded fill. Softening the *fill* instead leaves a smear with
    no shape of its own, which is why the blur belongs behind the mark rather
    than on it. **The radius is short**: a box blur of radius `r` averages
    `2r + 1` samples, so one approaching the item's own size averages its whole
    backdrop to a single colour, and the mark reads as a smudge with an accent
    cast instead of as glass. It must take the backdrop's fine grain and leave
    its larger shapes legible — the theme states the length, and rendering
    tests bracket it from both sides. Selection is still the only mark in the
    accent, so the pointer can never imitate it (§11.13 states the same rule
    for rows).
  - **The mark cross-fades as the selection moves**, over the theme's
    `SelectionChange` duration (§9): the item being left decays from full to
    nothing while the item arrived at grows, so a selection never jumps
    between items. The strength scales the frost and the fill together, so a
    backdrop never snaps into focus ahead of the colour leaving it. It is the
    *owner's* to state, not the composed state's to infer — the item being left
    is already unselected while its mark is still decaying — so the tile takes
    it as an explicit fade value
    and a host that does not animate sets none. A reduced-motion theme reports
    a zero duration and the change settles at once, with no second code path
    and no animation frame asked for.
  - **The label keeps the ordinary foreground over that fill.** The fill tints
    what lies behind it rather than replacing it, and a near-white on-accent
    name over a light theme's pale-orange result would be unreadable, so the
    on-accent inversion belongs only to the opaque plate below.
  - **A high-contrast theme keeps the crisp opaque accent panel** and inverts
    the label and glyph to the on-accent foreground. A translucent fill over a
    blurred backdrop is the wrong answer where contrast is the whole point, so
    the accessible path paints the flat panel and frosts nothing — and it does
    not fade either: the panel arrives with the selection, because a
    half-arrived plate under inverted ink is exactly the contrast that policy
    guarantees.
  - Keyboard focus draws the shared Focus Ring, so a focused tile reads
    distinctly from a hovered one — **but never on a selected tile**, where the
    fill is already the mark. **The pointer wash is suppressed on a selected
    tile for the same reason.** Both follow the *selection*, never the mark's
    momentary strength: an outline or a wash that appeared for as long as a
    mark took to arrive read as a border flickering on and off under the
    pointer.
  - An authority or recovery state shows its shape-coded Signal Bead (§12.4) in
    the top-trailing corner, so a denied or unhealthy item is legible without
    relying on colour.
- The picture occupies a square slot across the top of the tile, capped so the
  lower part always remains for the label. **The label wraps**: it is centred
  beneath the picture over as many whole lines as the band under the picture
  holds, broken at whitespace (an unbreakable word is broken mid-word rather
  than spilled), and only the last line is elided, with the shared ellipsis
  mark. A name too long for one line is not silently cut — that reads as a
  different name.
- There is exactly one definition of each of the two geometries, and an owner
  queries it rather than re-deriving it: `icon_side` for the picture slot, so
  artwork is rasterised at precisely the side the tile will draw it in, and
  `label_lines` for the band, so an owner can size a tile tall enough for the
  names it will carry. Line capacity is not layout — a one-word name still
  draws one line.
- Artwork reaches the tile already decoded and rasterised (§10 of the charter,
  `plans/ICONS.md`); a tile with none falls back to the built-in glyph for its
  icon kind, tinted like its label, so a system with no artwork on disk still
  shows a meaningful icon.
- A tile renders state and never dispatches: an icon view owns the layout and
  hit-tests pointer input against that same geometry, so a tile holds no pointer
  position or press latch of its own (unlike a row, which the user clicks
  directly).
- **Nothing a tile draws escapes its own bounds.** A view may therefore lay
  tiles edge to edge, and bound the grid's paint to the area it owns, without a
  tile bleeding onto its neighbour.

### 11.35 Chart

A chart is the history instrument of the value/measured family: a read-only
control, like a MetricTile's track instrument (§11.33) and Progress (§11.7),
that plots one bounded oldest-to-newest series of readings as a line.

- **A chart owns its box, and its readings map across the whole of it.** Full
  capacity is the ceiling and nothing at all is the floor, both inset only by
  the room the line's own weight needs.
- **The ceiling is stated where it is not a capacity.** A series is permille of
  the resource's capacity by default; one that counts things has no capacity to
  be a share of, so it states its own denominator (`with_full_scale`) and the
  box's top edge means that. A zero denominator falls back to the permille
  default rather than failing the draw. Refitting the ceiling to each window
  instead would redraw the same history differently every time it rolled, so a
  stated scale is the caller's to choose and to keep stable. This is the whole reason it is not a
  track variant: a series confined to an instrument track's thickness cannot
  rise more than a pixel or two whatever its values are, which is a graph that
  cannot report its own data.
- **It is a line, not a bar field.** Adjacent readings are joined, because the
  shape between two samples is the trend the reader is there for. A quiet
  filled area beneath the line gives it a body, so a low-amplitude series still
  reads as a shape rather than a wandering hairline; the line stays the thing
  being read.
- **That area fades out at the zero line it is read against.** A flat fill
  draws the floor as a second hard edge across the box, which reads as a
  measurement the chart never took; ramping the fill out means the only edges
  the eye finds are the trace and the axis. The ramp is the *band's*, not the
  trace's — full strength at the edge a rising reading grows toward, nothing at
  the zero line — so the fill's weight at a given height means the same thing
  whatever the reading happens to be there, which is what lets a reader compare
  two columns of one chart, or the same row of two charts, by eye. A mirrored
  opposing band grows the other way and so ramps the other way. Its peak is
  twice a flat fill's weight, so the ink is redistributed toward the trace
  rather than reduced. The shape's own anti-aliased coverage and the ramp
  multiply in one pass (`Surface::wash_polygon_subpixel`), composited through
  the surface's ordered dither, because a ramp over a few dozen rows holds
  fewer output levels than input ones and rounding every row the same way is
  what turns it into visible flat bands.
- **The trace is tinted by a `SignalRole`, not by a resource pressure.** A
  resource-identity trace passes `PressureKind::signal_role()` and reads as
  that resource's rail colour exactly as a MetricTile's track does (§11.33) —
  a fixed identity, never the accent and never a transient severity. But not
  every signal a chart carries *is* a resource under load: a task census is
  what the machine is running, and a *direction* of transfer is a signal in
  its own right. Those name their own role, so the vocabulary the theme
  already has for semantic signals is the one the chart takes.
- **The box is a fixed window and the newest reading is pinned to its trailing
  edge**, one slot per sample whatever the series holds. A series shorter than
  the window reaches back only as far as its readings genuinely go, and each new
  sample slides the shape one slot left. Spreading `count` readings across the
  whole box instead made the trace rewrite its own shape on every sample — the
  same history redrawn at a different scale — and claimed a minute's span for
  three seconds of readings. A reading's mark is never thinner than the line
  drawing it, so a box too narrow to resolve one slot still shows its newest
  reading rather than dropping it.
- **An owner may caption the box at both ends.** A trace is a *window*, so the
  surface that owns one states how far back it reaches and that its trailing
  edge is the present. The chart draws no such labels itself: the span depends
  on the owner's own sampling cadence, which the control cannot know, and a
  label claiming a span the points were not taken at is a fabricated reading.
- **The chart lays down no ground of its own.** It draws its trace onto
  whatever surface it was given, so the box reads as part of the plate it sits
  on rather than as a panel cut into it.
- **An empty series plots nothing at all**, leaving the plate it sits on: an honest
  "nothing recorded yet". A fabricated flat line along the floor would read as
  a measured idle. A single reading *is* a measurement, so it holds the one slot
  it is at its own height rather than the whole box — holding it across would
  claim a window's history for one reading.
- Readings run oldest to newest, left to right. The series is bounded and the
  oldest readings are dropped first, so a chart is a window on a history and
  never an unbounded log the render path must walk.
- Out-of-range readings are clamped fail closed, and a box too small to plot in
  degrades to nothing rather than drawing outside itself.

**A rate with two directions is one reading, so a chart takes an optional
opposing series.** Read/write and receive/send are the cases; drawing them as
two stacked charts loses the comparison the reader is there for.

- The box splits at a drawn **axis** — the zero line both series read against —
  the primary series rising above it and the opposing one **mirrored** below,
  so a rising reading in either direction grows *away* from the axis.
- **Each direction is tinted by its own role**, through the same lookup every
  trace uses, and is bounded and clamped by the same rule as the primary one.
  A caller passes the *direction* each half measures — read against write,
  receive against send — because giving both halves the device's own hue draws
  one reading in one colour and says nothing about which way the bytes went.
  There is one chart control and one plot path: a second
  duplex control beside this one is forbidden.
- **Adding an opposing series asserts that the direction is measured.** A
  direction with no reading behind it is left off, so the chart stays a
  single-series trend over the whole box rather than showing an empty half as a
  quiet nothing. A measured zero *is* a reading and plots flat on the axis.
- An axis is drawn only where something is plotted: a duplex chart with no
  readings in either direction draws nothing, so a rule across an
  empty box can never read as a measured nought.
- A box too short to seat an axis and both halves draws nothing at all.
  Half a duplex reading is worse than none, so it is not drawn.
- **Damage and settle point.** A chart is read-only: it has no settle point,
  and its pixels are its owner's to report when the series it was handed
  changes.

#### Icon views and the space a line has left over

An icon view lays its tiles out on a wrapped grid. **A line holds only whole
tiles**: a tile the line's end would cut short is not placed on it, because a
part-drawn picture over an unreadable name that no scroll could bring whole is
not a legible item. Along the scroll axis the lines follow one another however
many there are, and a line the viewport's edge crosses is drawn cut, as every
scrolled item is (§11.28). As many whole tiles as a line holds almost never
divide it exactly, so the view chooses one of two fill policies for what is
left over. This is a property of the *view*, not of the tile.

- **A resizable icon view spreads.** The leftover space is shared out along the
  line: the gaps between the tiles widen by equal amounts and the margins at the
  two ends match, so the line reads as filled rather than as a listing that
  stopped short of a widening blank margin. Widening the view past one more
  whole tile re-flows the content into an extra slot.
- **A tile never stretches to fill space.** Only the space *between* tiles
  moves, so a tile's picture slot, label field, and hit target read the same at
  every size, and every tile still lines up with the one above it — including on
  a part-filled last line, whose empty slots stay at the trailing end.
- **The pitch is the floor, and the scroll axis is never spread.** A line that
  fits its tiles exactly is laid out identically under either policy; and the
  axis the view scrolls along keeps the fixed pitch, because the space past its
  last whole line belongs to the next line, one scroll away.
- **A fixed icon field keeps the pitch.** The desktop's icon field is not
  resizable content: keeping one tile-plus-gap pitch from the edge its icons hug
  means an icon stays where the user last saw it whatever the field's exact
  extent is, rather than drifting when that extent changes by a few pixels.

### 11.36 FactList and Timeline

The **record-list family**: two read-only instruments that state what a thing
*is* and what has *happened* to it. Both sit beside MetricTile (§11.33),
Progress (§11.7), and Chart (§11.35) in the read-only half of the design
language — no pointer or keyboard handling, no action type, no interior
mutability; the owner supplies every visible fact and re-renders when one
changes.

- **They report a record, not a measurement, and that is the family
  boundary.** A metric tile's track and a chart's trace are tinted by the
  resource's own semantic rail colour, because there the colour *is* the
  resource's fixed identity (§11.33, §11.35). A fact and an event carry text,
  not a resource, so neither takes a rail colour. Their optional tone is a
  Signal Role naming a transient condition — healthy, denied, recovering —
  exactly as a StatusPill's is (§11.33), and it is always *additional* to the
  words, never the only thing carrying the meaning.
- **An empty collection draws nothing at all** — no plate, no rule, no spine.
  An empty frame would assert "this record exists and is known to be empty",
  which neither control can know: only its owner can tell "nothing has
  happened yet" from "we could not ask". The owner draws that sentence.
- **A row draws only while a whole row still fits, and the remainder is
  omitted rather than clipped mid-row** (fail closed). Half a fact is a
  misreading; an absent fact is an absence the owner's own bounds explain.
- One row pitch — the body font's line height plus the theme's control gap —
  is shared by both controls and by the `row_height` a host lays out with, so
  a surface stacking a fact list above a timeline cannot disagree with what
  either actually draws.

#### FactList

A column of label/value pairs at a shared row pitch: the label quiet on the
left, the value emphasised on the right, optionally separated by hairline
rules.

- **The value keeps its measured width and the label gives way first**,
  elided with the shared mark like every identifier (§11A). The
  reading is what the reader came for, so a detail pane too narrow for both
  loses a word of description rather than a digit. This is the opposite of a
  ListRow (§11.13), where the name is the thing being read.
- Values are right-aligned on one another across the whole list, so a column
  of readings can be compared down its right edge rather than scanned for
  where each number starts.
- A separator is drawn only when the row *after* it also fits, so a truncated
  list never ends on a rule promising a row that was not drawn.

#### Timeline

An ordered record of what happened and when: a connector spine down the left,
a mark per event, a stamp column, and the event's text.

- **The two event kinds differ by shape, not hue.** A routine step is a
  hollow ring and a notable one a filled disc, so the distinction survives a
  high-contrast theme, a monochrome display, and a reader who cannot separate
  the tones. A Signal Role tone on a notable mark is emphasis on top of a
  shape that already reads.
- **The spine spans only from the first drawn mark's centre to the last, and
  is omitted entirely for a single event.** A spine running to the edges of
  the box would imply history before the first record and after the last —
  the same fabrication a chart's flat floor line would be (§11.35).
- The mark is the theme's Signal Bead extent, the same compact mark the shell
  surfaces already draw their beads at, and the gutter is exactly the mark's
  diameter with the spine down its centre — so the column that follows needs
  to know nothing about the mark's geometry, and there is no second mark size
  in the language.
- The stamp column is as wide as the widest stamp in the timeline, measured
  through the same font that draws it, so every stamp aligns on one shared
  measurement rather than a guessed column width.
- **Order is the owner's, and the control does not sort.** Oldest-first and
  newest-first are both legitimate readings of a record, and which one a
  surface wants is its own editorial decision. This is the deliberate
  contrast with Chart (§11.35), where oldest-to-newest left-to-right is fixed
  because the *shape* of a series only means anything against a known
  direction.

#### Present-day consumers

Both controls exist because surfaces already need them, not ahead of one:
`FactList` is the Switchboard's per-resource and per-cause readout and the
body of the icon bar's manifest-attested **About** panel — which is why it
must not tone a value into meaning the words do not carry, since the panel is
system-drawn chrome stating a signed identity (§13). `Timeline` is the
Switchboard's recovery and background-activity record.

### 11.37 Breadcrumb

The **location trail**: a path of crumbs naming where the reader is, so a deep
surface can say so and let them step back to any ancestor. A `Crumb` carries a
label and a composed state; the trail owns the geometry, the pointer, the
focus, and the elision.

- **The trailing crumb is the current location and never activates**, however
  it is addressed — pointer, `Enter`, `Home`/`End`. A reader can never
  "navigate" to where they already are, so the trail refuses it rather than
  emitting an action the owner would have to filter. Focus cannot land on it
  either: `set_focus` clears instead (fail closed).
- **Position decides whether a crumb activates, not the crumb.** `Crumb`
  carries no "is current" flag, because being current is a fact about a
  crumb's place in the trail and a duplicated flag could contradict it.
- **A disabled or denied crumb keeps its slot.** It reads as refused and shows
  its Authority Mark, exactly as a Menu row does (§11.11) — a path that
  collapsed around an inaccessible ancestor would misstate the hierarchy, not
  just hide a command.
- **Overflow elides whole crumbs from the front, never mid-label.** The oldest
  ancestors go first, behind a single leading ellipsis that itself activates
  the newest ancestor it stands for — so an elided ancestor is still reachable
  rather than merely hidden. Only when even the ellipsis plus the current
  crumb will not fit is the ellipsis dropped too, leaving the current crumb
  alone with its own label shrunk. The current location is the last thing
  surrendered because it is the one fact the trail exists to state.
- **The ellipsis is three periods, not `…`.** The mark has to render under
  whatever coverage the console atlas or a proportional family ships; a glyph
  that might come back as a missing-character box is not a mark.
- **The ellipsis paints as an idle, enabled crumb** whatever the crumbs behind
  it are. It is not disabled or denied on its own account, and toning it from
  a hidden crumb's state would attribute one ancestor's condition to a mark
  standing for several.
- **A focused crumb elided out of individual view keeps its ring on the
  ellipsis.** Focus is never invisible: the ring shows on the cell that
  actually represents the focused crumb.
- **One layout walk serves render and hit-test.** `plan` decides the elided
  cells and places them, and both painting and `crumb_at` read it, so a press
  can never land on a crumb that was not drawn or resolve to a different one
  than the reader clicked. `crumb_rect` is its forward mirror, so a caller —
  including a pointer-driven test — can aim at exactly the drawn cell.
- **A press latches its crumb until release.** A click that slides onto
  another crumb activates nothing, so a mis-aimed drag never navigates.
- The chevron separator and the focus ring come from the shared `paint` core,
  and the chevron slot doubles under heavier contrast exactly as
  `plate_border`/`rail_thickness` already do — there is no second separator
  or ring recipe in the language.

### 11.38 ActionRail

The **vertical command column** a detail surface offers about the thing it is
showing: the counterpart to the horizontal Toolbar (§11.9), stacked so its
labels align.

- **Each item *is* a Button (§11.1).** The rail restates none of a button's
  plate, press feedback, role emphasis, disabled look, or Authority Mark for a
  denied action. It owns only the stacking geometry, which item the pointer is
  over, which holds focus, routing input, and translating a completed
  `ButtonAction` into a typed `RailAction`. A second plate recipe here would
  be the duplication the language forbids.
- **An item's height is the button family's own standard control height**, and
  items are separated by the theme's control gap — never a number the rail
  invents, so a rail beside a toolbar cannot disagree with it about how tall a
  command is.
- **Every item spans the rail's full width.** A column of commands is read
  down its labels, so ragged widths would make the column a list of shapes
  rather than a list of verbs.
- **Too short a rail draws as many whole items as fit from the top and omits
  the rest.** Half an item is a command a reader might aim at and miss; an
  absent one is an absence the owner's own bounds explain (fail closed).
  Hit-testing, rendering, and measurement all walk the one shared layout, so a
  press can never land on an item that was not drawn.
- **A rail anchored beside moving content can light an Edge Wake down its
  leading edge** (§12.1). The rail itself does not move — that is the point —
  so the wake is how the reader learns the list beside it did.

### 11.39 TableHeader

The **column names above a TableRow's cells** (§11.14), and for a sortable
column the surface that reports a sort request.

- **The header and the rows share exactly one column-width model.** Both
  resolve their spans through the same helper over the same leading-gutter and
  trailing-bead reservations, so a header can never drift out of alignment
  with the rows it names. Two independently-derived widths that happen to
  agree today are the drift this forecloses.
- **The header reports a sort; it never performs one, and never assumes its
  request was honoured.** `HeaderAction::Sort` is a request. The owner applies
  whatever sort it actually applied and commits it with `set_sort`, and *that*
  is what the header draws. A header that drew its own request would claim an
  order the data may not be in — including when the sort was refused.
- **Pressing an already-sorted column flips its order**, through the one
  `SortOrder::other` definition, so no caller re-derives what the opposite of
  ascending is.
- **Sortable is the default; a column opts out.** Most columns of a table are
  meaningful to order by, so `HeaderColumn::fixed` is the exception that says
  otherwise — and a fixed column emits no sort request however it is
  addressed.
- **A denied column keeps its title and shows its Authority Mark** rather than
  vanishing or collapsing the layout (§13). A column that disappeared would
  misalign every row beneath it.
- The sort indicator, the focus ring, and the plate rounding all come from the
  shared `paint` core.

#### Present-day consumers

All three exist because surfaces already need them, not ahead of one.
`Breadcrumb` names the location in the file manager's and the file picker's
chrome; `ActionRail` is the command column of a detail surface beside a
listing; `TableHeader` names and sorts the columns of every table the shell
draws. §5 already binds `Breadcrumb::set_focus` and
`TableHeader::set_focus`/`set_sort` as the interactive entry points, each
reporting the cells its ring or indicator moves between so a host repaints
exactly those.

### 11.40 CompositionBar

A composition bar answers a question no other instrument in the language can:
*where did it go*. A track (§11.33) says how much of a resource is in use and a
Chart (§11.35) says what it has been doing, but neither splits that use into
the parts it is made of. The bar is a read-only instrument, like both of them.

- **The parts account for the whole, or there is no bar.** Shares that do not
  sum to all of it are a *construction* error, not a silently short bar: a
  composition that does not account for everything is not a composition. An
  out-of-range share is clamped fail closed first, so the excess can never
  draw past the bar's own end and surfaces as the sum not adding up.
- **One proportional band, through the one measured-track geometry.** The
  groove, its rounding and its proportional arithmetic are the ones a
  MetricTile's track draws with (§11.33); the parts are filled to their
  *cumulative* shares, back to front, so the parts butt cleanly without a
  second segment recipe.
- **The band is broader than a progress line** — its own
  `composition_thickness` metric, several times `progress_thickness` — because
  a composition is *categorical*: the eye has to match each coloured run to a
  name in the key beneath it, and a run a few pixels tall is a colour a reader
  cannot identify. It stays under `control_height`, so the band still reads as
  an instrument rather than a plate.
- **Only the band's two outer ends are rounded.** A part that meets another
  ends at a straight edge. A rounded cap there lets the *next* part's colour
  through the corner notches above and below the join — as deep as the band's
  radius, so it grows with the band's breadth — and the boundary reads as a
  curved wedge instead of a division.
- **The parts separate by hue, because they are categories rather than
  degrees.** The sequence is the theme's own resource hues in a fixed rotation
  that keeps neighbours far apart on the wheel, led by the bar's own resource
  so a memory composition still reads as memory where it starts. More used
  parts than the rotation can tell apart is a construction error: a part
  wearing another's hue is not a part a reader can find.
- **The joins are ruled**, so the parts stay countable where hue carries
  nothing — the monochrome-safe path, and a reader who cannot separate two of
  them. The rule thickens under heavier contrast exactly as `plate_border`
  does.
- **The part that is *not* in use is the remainder**, drawn in the track
  family's own quiet neutral so it reads as the unfilled tail while the key
  still names it. A composition has at most one, and it is the last part: a
  neutral band anywhere else would read as a gap the composition failed to
  account for, which is the opposite of what it says.
- **The key names every part and its amount**, beneath the bar, each entry led
  by a swatch in its part's own tint — a neutral swatch, never a Signal Bead:
  a key entry names a part of a reading, it does not raise an alert. The key
  **wraps** rather than dropping an entry, because a part of the bar the key
  cannot name is a segment with no meaning; the height it needs therefore
  depends on the width it is given, and the bar states it for that width.
- A height too short for the whole key drops the rows it cannot seat and keeps
  the reading: the bar outranks its own key. A box too small to seat the bar at
  all draws nothing rather than outside itself.
- **The bar draws no plate of its own**, so several readings seated in one
  Panel share that container's surface (§10's plate seating).
- **Damage and settle point.** Read-only: it has no settle point, and its
  pixels are its owner's to report when the composition it was handed changes.
### 11.41 FieldRow and FieldGroup

A settings surface is a column of captioned groups of label/description/control
rows. That shape is the language's, not each application's: the Settings
panes, the Date & Time window and the file manager's Permissions section all
compose it, and none carries a layout of its own. A `FieldRow` is one setting;
a `FieldGroup` is the captioned plate its rows sit on.

- **A row composes the row chrome, it does not restate it.** The hover wash,
  the leading pressure and selection rails, the activity Heat Seam, the
  trailing Signal Bead band and the focus ring are the ones `ListRow` and
  `TableRow` draw (§11.13), from one shared recipe — so a change to how a
  selected or refused row reads cannot diverge between a list and a form. The
  slot likewise holds a *real* control (§11.4–§11.9), never a second drawing
  of one.
- **A row's disposition is the setting's.** The row shares its enablement,
  authority and validation — exactly what decides actionability — with the
  control in its slot, so a denied or pending setting cannot hold an actionable
  control. A pane therefore states a refusal by setting the *row*,
  never by remembering to set two states in step. A disabled row mutes; a
  denied one wears the Authority Mark (§13) in a band reserved either way, so
  becoming denied never moves the row's own control.
- **Three absences read differently, because they are different facts.**
  Plainly disabled (the setting does not apply), the Authority Mark (this
  caller may not change it), and a *stated* unmeasured value (there is no
  reading, and why) are distinct. An unmeasured slot draws its statement in the
  quiet muted tone whatever the row's disposition, so it can never be mistaken
  for a measurement — never a blank, a dash, or a fabricated zero.
- **Room is given out control, label, description.** The slot is served first
  and never past **half** the row's content span, so a label always has room
  to be read. The label elides into what remains, and the description draws
  only while the label fits *whole*: once the setting's own name has had to be
  cut, a second cut line beneath it is noise. Words are what a narrowing row
  loses, because the control is what the reader came for.
- **One slot column per group.** The group resolves the widest width its rows
  want, or the half-span ceiling when a row's control takes whatever column it
  is given — a cramped slider cannot be aimed and a cramped entry cannot be
  read. Each control answers its own width (`measured_width`), so the column
  comes from the controls' own layout rather than a second copy of it. A choice
  control measures its **widest** choice, not the selected one, so choosing a
  different value never resizes the field or moves the column. A group also
  answers its **natural width** — the narrowest plate that seats every measured
  control whole under the ceiling — so an owner sizing a window from its
  content opens it with every control readable.
- **A few independent flags are one slot, not several settings.** A
  `FlagSet` holds a small set of labelled checkboxes (§11.5) on one line — the
  read, write and execute bits of one permission class. Each flag *is* a
  `Checkbox`: the set restates none of its box, press, focus ring, disabled
  look or Authority Mark, and owns only the layout seating them side by side,
  the flag the pointer is over, the one holding a press, and the one the
  keyboard rests on. It measures every flag's own width plus the room after
  its label — never less than the Signal Bead band, so a flag marked denied
  does not stamp its bead over its own label — and in a slot too narrow for
  that, every box keeps its size while the labels share what is left and elide
  through the checkbox's own mark; only a slot narrower than the boxes narrows
  them. Left and Right move the keyboard between flags and clamp at either end;
  Space and Enter toggle the one it rests on. The row reports the one flag that
  changed as `SetFlag { index, on }`, so the owner commits that flag alone. The
  row's refusal is every flag's.
- **A column of groups is one plate column.** Groups stacked down a pane are
  placed and measured by the one shared plate column
  (`tairix_controls::stack`): a gap above and beside each plate, every plate at
  its natural size, and a height that holds them all — so no surface carries
  its own copy of the gaps. A column taller than its pane scrolls by pixels
  (§11.28), a plate its edge crosses drawn cut.
- **An open choice list is modal.** It hangs over the rows and plates beneath
  it, so while it is up only the row holding it sees the pointer, a press on it
  never reaches what it covers, and it is painted above the rest of the window
  it shares — a footer band or a scrollbar included.
- **A group draws one plate, not a plate per row** (§10's plate seating), and
  its caption and footnote begin exactly where a row's label does, so the three
  read as one column rather than three indents. The footnote is where a setting
  needs a sentence of consequence — on the surface, not behind a tooltip a
  pointer has to find.
- **A group's caption may carry a badge**, the state capsule (§11.33) naming
  where the thing the group is about stands — a volume's health, or how many
  of a settings plate's rows differ from what is in effect. The group places
  it, because it is the only thing that can also take the room out of the
  caption and out of the band's height. It is settable in place as well as at
  construction, because a state that moves while the reader works must not
  cost a rebuild of rows holding a caret and a selection; the capsule rides a
  band of its own either way, so an owner that sets one re-measures.
- **The owner places the choice popup.** An expanded list is drawn above every
  group, so a row cannot paint it — the group's later rows would cover it. The
  group names the row and slot to anchor it to; the owner places it within the
  viewport it alone knows and paints it after every group is drawn. That
  viewport is the *only* thing the owner has to supply: `FieldGroup::layout`
  takes it and answers the whole layout — the group's slot column, and the
  list placed by the one drop-down placement rule (§11.9) — so an owner laying
  its groups out independently carries none of that arithmetic. An owner
  sharing one column across several groups takes the widest
  (`FieldGroup::shared_column`) and places the list through the anchor
  instead. The column is an input to every row question a group answers —
  its height, its rows' rectangles and hit test, its focus damage — because
  it decides what a description wraps into: a group measured in its own
  narrower column and drawn in a wider shared one would cut the
  description's last line.
- **The cursor clamps within a group and never traps itself.** Up and Down walk
  rows and stop at the ends, because a group is a fixed set of settings rather
  than a cycling ring and the surface above it carries the cursor *between*
  groups. Home and End jump to the ends unless the focused row is editing text,
  where they move a caret; an open choice list is modal and every key is the
  list's until it resolves.
- **A height too short for every row omits the ones it cannot draw whole**, and
  a row that was not drawn cannot be pressed — one layout serves the paint, the
  hit test and the focus reporting.
- **Damage and settle point.** A row reports what the control in its slot asked
  for and commits nothing itself; the slider slot's live value and its settle
  point stay distinct (§11.6), and a durable change is made on the settle
  alone. A pointer crossing one row reports that row; motion within it is
  hit-testing input and reports nothing — except the motion that leaves the
  slot's control, which reaches it so its hover look goes with the pointer.
- **A group may hold a picture choice beneath its rows** (§11.43), a setting
  too visual for a list. It is the group's item after its last row: the
  keyboard reaches it with Down from that row and leaves it with Up from its
  first line, a `FieldGroupAction` naming row `rows().len()` is its, and the
  group's focus rectangle is the one picture its cursor is on, so an owner
  scrolls a picture into view rather than a choice taller than the view.

### 11.42 TextArea

A `TextArea` is the text-entry family's multi-line member: the same plate,
page ground, caret, selection, disposition and validation rendering as a
`TextField` (§11.8, §13), over text that **wraps at the box's own width**.
That is the difference between the two and the reason both exist — a
single-line field holds a value and scrolls sideways, and a box that holds a
paragraph wraps it, because a paragraph read through a one-line window is not
read at all.

- **Wrapping is the behaviour, not an option.** There is no horizontal scroll
  and no wrap toggle. The text is laid out to the viewport's width through the
  one shared fitter, and a newline the user typed is a forced break.
- **The caret and the selection work in the lines the reader sees.** Up and
  Down move between visual lines and keep the column they set out from; Home
  and End reach the ends of the visual line, Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End the ends of
  the text, PageUp and PageDown a viewport; Shift extends the selection with
  every one of those. A click lands on the character nearest the pointer on the
  line it fell on, clamped to that line's own visible text.
- **Enter inserts a newline** and reports an edit; it never submits. Escape
  still cancels.
- **It scrolls vertically and says that it does.** The caret is kept in view as
  it moves, the wheel and the page keys move the viewport without moving the
  caret, and text longer than the box grows the shared ScrollBar (§11.28) in a
  trailing gutter. The gutter is taken out of the text's column only when the
  text overflows; narrowing the column can only add lines, so the decision
  settles in one pass rather than flickering.
- **There is no masked mode.** A credential is a single value, so masking is
  `TextField`'s (§11.8); a multi-line masked box would be a credential nobody
  could check.
- **An owner seats it by rows, not pixels.** `measured_height(rows, width, ..)`
  turns "show four lines of text" into an extent, because how tall that is
  depends on the theme's type ladder and the DPI scale.

### 11.43 PictureChoice

A `PictureChoice` is a one-of-several setting chosen by its picture — a
wallpaper, a screensaver — where a list of names would ask the reader to
imagine what each looks like.

- **One shape, the one the choice is seen in.** Every picture is drawn at one
  fixed `Aspect` — `WIDESCREEN` for anything a screen shows — inside a rounded
  rim at the theme's control corner radius, with its name beneath, centred and
  elided to the tile. Tiles of one size wrap into lines spread across the
  width through the shared grid arithmetic (`tairix_geometry::GridRun`), under
  optional section titles, each section starting a line of its own.
- **The owner renders, the control draws.** The owner hands each picture over
  already rendered at `picture_size` — a control never decodes an image — and
  the control blits it with rounded corners (`Surface::blit_rounded`). A
  picture not yet arrived, or one rendered at a size the choice no longer
  draws, shows its built-in glyph on a quiet ground: the choice is usable from
  its first frame and never blank, and a stale picture is never stretched or
  cut. A **swatch** is a choice that is a flat colour, drawn by the control
  itself — a fixed colour, or the empty desktop's in the theme it is drawn
  with.
- **The chosen picture wears the accent.** A ring in the accent colour frames
  the chosen picture; under a heavier contrast the whole tile takes the accent
  panel and its name the accent's own ink, so the choice is legible by more
  than a thin line. The pointer's hover and press wash the tile; the keyboard
  cursor wears the focus ring; a denied or recovering choice wears its bead in
  the picture's corner, and a disabled one is half veiled but still shows what
  it holds.
- **Choosing commits the choice, and reports it.** A press chooses nothing; a
  release on the picture the press began on chooses it, and a release
  elsewhere does nothing. The choice moves its own selection and reports the
  two tiles that changed, exactly as a combo box commits its field; choosing
  the picture already chosen reports nothing. The owner adopts the value, and
  a refused one is put back by the owner's rebuild.
- **The keyboard walks pictures, not pixels.** Left and Right step one
  picture; Up and Down one line, keeping the slot and crossing into the
  neighbouring section's nearest line; Home and End go to the ends; Enter or
  Space chooses. A key with nowhere further to go answers nothing, so the
  owner can carry the cursor on. A moved cursor is reported, for an owner that
  shows the choice through a scrolled view to reveal it.
- **One layout for every question.** Measure, paint, hit test, a picture's
  rectangle and the walk over every picture (`for_each_item_rect`) are one
  layout, so an owner deciding which pictures to render ahead and which to let
  go asks the same geometry the paint uses, once.

## 11A. Text that does not fit: wrap it or mark it

Every control in §11 draws text, and this decides what it does when the text
is wider than the room. The question is settled by what the text **is**, not
by which control it sits in, and the answer is the same in every control — a
second policy anywhere is a defect.

- **Prose wraps.** A run of prose is laid out over the lines its box holds,
  because a sentence cut at the box's edge is a sentence the reader has to
  guess the end of. This binds: a Dialog's message and inline reason (§11.24),
  a Notification's and a Card's body (§11.25, §11.15), a Tooltip and a
  HelpTip's reason (§11.32), a FieldRow's description and a FieldGroup's
  footnote (§11.41), a text control's inline validation message (§11.8), a
  Tabs group's stated absence (§11.12), and an IconTile's caption (§11.34).
- **An identifier does not.** A name in fixed-height chrome — a Button label,
  a MenuItem, a Tab, a TableCell, a TitleBar title, a Breadcrumb crumb, a
  ListRow title, a MetricTile reading — stays on one line and ends in the
  shared ellipsis mark. Wrapping one would move everything laid out beside and
  beneath it, and a name is scanned rather than read: the mark says the rest is
  there, which is all the reader needs.
- **A newline is a forced break, everywhere.** A paragraph ends where its
  author ended it, and a blank line between two of them is drawn as a blank
  line rather than closed up. A newline never reaches the glyph blitter.
- **One fitter, one recipe.** The break rules are `lib/font`'s shared fitter
  and the stacked-lines drawing is one recipe in `lib/controls` (the
  multi-line sibling of the single-line one). No control writes a break loop,
  and a hand-rolled one in an application is a review blocker — the one this
  rule replaced measured every candidate line separately and allocated a
  `Vec` of them on every repaint.
- **Wrapping makes a height depend on a width, so the measurement takes one.**
  A control that carries prose is asked for its height *at a width*, measures
  through the very block its paint draws, and bounds that paint by the room it
  was actually given — so a surface sized by the measurement draws exactly
  what it reserved, and one given less elides rather than spilling. A surface
  with no owner to ask (a Tooltip, a HelpTip) caps itself at the typographic
  **prose measure** rather than growing a plate across the screen: a figure in
  *characters* of the face's own column width, so it follows the scale and the
  family instead of guessing a pixel count.
- **Every prose block is bounded, and the bound is containment.** Each run
  takes at most a stated number of lines and the excess is elided. A notice's
  body is another program's text: no one notice may push every other one out
  of a popover however much it has to say — a fixed bound, not a capacity.
- **A box too narrow for one glyph draws no text**, rather than a column of
  overflowing glyphs. The one exception is an *editable* layout, where the
  text must stay covered so the caret can reach every position: there the
  character is taken and the line overflows, and the control clips.

---

## 12. Reactive State Patterns

### 12.1 Edge Wake

When content scrolls or rearranges near an anchored control, the edge nearest the movement can briefly brighten. The control does not move. This confirms that the control stayed anchored while the surrounding state changed.

Use Edge Wake for taskbar controls, sticky table headers, panel actions, and pinned toolbars.

### 12.2 Progress Seam

A related job paints progress on the lower edge of its object and on actions that operate on that job.

Example: a file copy row and its `Pause`, `Cancel`, and `OpenDestination` actions share the same progress identity. The `Pause` button shows the strongest seam because it operates on the running job. `Cancel` shows a weaker seam and a danger hover rim.

### 12.3 Pressure Rail

Resource pressure is directional and semantic.

- CPU pressure: compute rail.
- Memory pressure: memory rail.
- Disk pressure: storage rail.
- Network activity: transfer rail.
- Thermal or power pressure: system rail.

The rail appears on the object causing or experiencing the pressure and on the recommended action.

A MetricTile's embedded track (§11.33) is the one exception to "appears only while under pressure": it is tinted by its rail colour at all times, because the tint is that instrument's fixed resource identity rather than a transient state. The Pressure Rail's severity still reaches it exactly as it reaches a Card — an emphasis outline when the resource is genuinely under load — it is simply drawn over a track that was already coloured.

### 12.4 Signal Bead

A Signal Bead is a compact state lamp.

- Count bead: number of queued or active items.
- Alert bead: warning or recovery mark.
- Authority bead: lock or denied mark.
- Completion bead: success mark.

A bead must have an accessible text equivalent.

### 12.5 Trace Line

Trace lines connect cause to action briefly. They are owned by the container, not by individual controls.

Example: selecting a high-memory process may briefly route from the row to the memory pressure card and then to a `SleepApp` action.

Trace lines are short-lived, reduced-motion aware, and never required to understand the UI.

### 12.6 Action Warmth

When the model can identify a safe recommended action, that action receives a warmer rim or leading edge. Competing actions remain visible but quieter.

Action Warmth must never imply authority. A recommended action can still be denied by capability checks after activation.

### 12.7 Recovery Latch

A recovery action is a deliberate control state for hung or broken work.

- Soft recovery: normal button with recovery rim.
- Restart: Recovery Latch with stronger perimeter and deliberate press timing.
- Force action: danger rim, confirmation posture, no playful movement.

### 12.8 Frame Activation

The active window receives the strongest Frame Rim and title treatment. Inactive windows retain complete furniture with quieter contrast. An application requesting attention receives a bounded bead or rim segment without stealing focus or starting an indefinite pulse. Activation state never changes frame measurements.

### 12.9 Scroll Edge Wake

When scrolling starts, the relevant Scroll Channel and the client edge in the direction of travel may brighten briefly. The thumb remains the authoritative position indicator. Reduced-motion mode keeps the wake static only while input is active, then returns directly to idle.

---

## 13. Authority and Security Rendering

Controls must distinguish these cases:

| Case | Rendering | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `DisabledByState` | Muted plate and label | No action because the object state makes it invalid. |
| `DeniedByAuthority` | Authority Mark plus reason | No action because the caller lacks authority. |
| `NeedsConfirmation` | Active control with deliberate confirmation posture | Action is possible but consequential. |
| `PendingCheck` | Heat Seam or verification mark | Awaiting backing service response. |
| `FailedClosed` | Warning or recovery state with typed reason | Action was refused safely. |

Never render an authority denial as though the control is merely inactive. Users should be able to understand whether they cannot act because the object is done, because the action is not valid, or because they lack authority.

**A missing capability is amber; a policy refusal is the denied red.** Both
resolve to `DeniedByAuthority` and both keep the Authority Mark's own shape, so
the distinction never rests on colour alone and survives a monochrome-safe
theme — but they are not the same refusal to a reader. `NeedsCapability` says
"you could hold the authority to lift this", so it takes `palette.warning` on
its rim, its label and its leading mark; `Denied` says "policy forecloses it"
and keeps `palette.denied`. The rim, label, mark and Signal Bead read one
shared resolution (`paint::authority_rgba`), so a gated command cannot read
amber on its text and red on its edge. The plate is untouched either way: the
storyboards draw the gated command as an amber-labelled, amber-rimmed button on
the same quiet plate as its neighbours (`plans/switchboard/02-cpu.png`, whose
"Scheduler policy…" rim samples `#362e15` against its neighbours' neutral
`#20272c`).

Security-sensitive controls must not display secrets, raw capability tokens, or hidden policy internals. They may show concise user-facing reasons such as "requires system permission" or "action blocked by policy".

Window furniture does not create authority. The window manager validates that a furniture event targets a live window owned by the addressed client and that the client cannot issue frame commands against another owner's window. Cooperative close, minimize, put-to-back, maximize, restore, move, resize, and scroll dispatch remain userland window operations. Force termination remains the distinct capability-checked recovery path. Root viewport ranges and resize constraints are validated and clamped before they influence geometry.

---

## 14. Layout, Density, and Scale

### Logical pixels

All dimensions are logical. The control code receives `Scale` and derives physical sizes through the shared conversion path.

### Density modes

| Density | Intended use |
|---|---|
| Compact | Tables, task lists, sidebars, dense system panels. |
| Normal | Default desktop applications. |
| Comfortable | Touch-adjacent or distance-viewed surfaces. |

Density changes metrics, not state semantics.

### Minimum targets

Interactive controls must meet the active theme's minimum target size. A dense table row may have smaller visual height only when a larger row target is supplied by row selection or keyboard focus behavior.

### Text stability

Labels, shortcuts, values, and icons keep their position while rims, rails, beads, and seams animate. Any value that changes frequently should use fixed-width numeric glyphs when available.

### Window frame geometry

- Title-bar height, frame inset, control extent, scrollbar breadth, corner cell, and resize hit slop are logical theme metrics.
- Active, inactive, hover, attention, and maximized states do not change the client origin or frame extents.
- The work-area clamp always leaves a usable title-bar region reachable after display, scale, or taskbar changes. A move-grab enforces it against the screen: the span between the two command clusters (`TitleBarLayout::drag`, the move surface) keeps its whole height on screen and at least a patch as wide as the band is tall, so a window may hang off any edge but never past having something to drag it back by. On a single big desktop spanning several monitors the screen is one region, so a window may straddle two of them.
- When space is constrained, title text truncates first; every window-command hit target stays usable, and the band still drags wherever it is not a control. The floor that guarantees it is `TitleBar::min_band_width` — both corner clusters, their insets, and one control extent of drag surface between them — which `WindowFrame::min_outer_size` turns into the smallest outer rectangle a window may be dragged to (that band plus the rim, and the furniture bands plus one standard control of client in height). A window's own application may declare a larger minimum client extent; the window manager honours whichever is greater, so a resize can never take a window below what either the furniture or the application needs.
- Overlay scrollbar hit regions must not cover title-bar controls, the resize grabber, or unrelated client actions. Reserved-gutter scrollbars must not resize the client in response to hover alone.

---

## 15. Accessibility

Reactive Alloy must be usable without color, without motion, and with keyboard input.

### Required accessibility behavior

- Every semantic color role has a non-color mark.
- Focus is visible and distinct from hover.
- Keyboard navigation reaches every action that pointer input can reach.
- Reduced motion converts animation into static state changes.
- High contrast increases rim, rail, and text contrast before adding more glow.
- Progress exposes text or numeric state when known.
- Count beads have text equivalents.
- Denied and destructive states have explicit labels or descriptions.
- Every window command has an accessible name that describes the action, not only its glyph.
- The size-toggle name and glyph describe the next action: Maximize or Restore.
- Active and inactive windows remain distinguishable without color.
- Window move, close, minimize, put-to-back, size toggle, and keyboard resize are reachable without a pointer through the established window or system menu path.
- Scrollbars expose orientation, current value, minimum, maximum, and page extent, and support keyboard line, page, and bound navigation.
- A drawn resize grabber uses a visible shape mark and an enlarged target in comfortable density. A window frame's resize zone is invisible by design, so keyboard resize (above) is its accessible path rather than a mark to find.

### Shape fallbacks

| Semantic state | Shape fallback |
|---|---|
| CPU pressure | short vertical rail ticks |
| Memory pressure | double rail |
| Disk pressure | lower seam plus storage glyph |
| Network activity | alternating dot marks |
| Recovery | diamond bead or latch outline |
| Success | check bead |
| Denied | lock bead |
| Active window | double Frame Rim, title-weight change, or another non-color frame distinction |
| Resize affordance | Grip Teeth in the corner where one is drawn; a window frame's zone is invisible |
| Scroll position | proportional thumb with accessible numeric range |

---

## 16. System Integration

### Active theme flow

`userland/gui/session` owns the active theme selection and relays it to the window manager, taskbar, and GUI applications. Controls listen for theme changes through the existing session or application model, then repaint through the normal surface path.

### Window furniture flow

`userland/gui/wm` owns the frame composition, furniture hit map, activation, stacking, move and resize capture, minimize state, maximize and restore geometry, and root-viewport scrollbar composition. The existing window path carries typed application metadata and events; it does not add a GUI-specific syscall.

The owning application provides the current title, optional application glyph reference, sizing constraints, and declared close, minimize, and resize support for that window class. The window manager and session derive put-to-back and size-toggle availability from stacking, modal, work-area, and sizing policy rather than accepting arbitrary z-order policy from the client. When a top-level client exposes a root viewport, it also provides a bounded scroll model and receives typed scroll requests. The window manager validates every range and constraint, then emits application-directed actions only to that window's owner.

Close is cooperative and application-directed. Minimize, put-to-back, activation, and size state are window-manager/session state. A hung close request may make recovery available, but it never silently converts into force termination. Nested application scrollbars use the same control specification and theme data while remaining inside the client surface.

### Application bundles

Applications may ship resources in their own bundle. Control visuals that are part of the shared TAIRiX design language belong in the OS-provided shared crates or curated assets, not copied into every application bundle.

### System state models

Controls that render live CPU, memory, disk, network, task, device, or limit information consume typed TAIRiX data. A control should receive a view model such as `TaskSummary`, `JobProgress`, `PressureSample`, `AuthorityStatus`, or `RecoveryRecommendation`, rather than opening devices or probing system state itself.

### Actions

Controls emit typed userland actions. The receiving service performs the operation, checks authority, validates input, logs security-relevant decisions, and returns typed success or error state. The control updates itself from that returned state.

---

## 17. Composing an Application Screen

An application's screen is composed of these controls; it is not specified here. This document defines the shared vocabulary, and each application's own plan defines the surface it builds from that vocabulary — which is why a screen's composition lives in the application crate rather than in `lib/controls`.

What this specification does bind for every such screen:

- The window uses the standard `WindowFrame` and `TitleBar` with the standard window-manager commands; an application never paints its own frame chrome.
- Content taller or wider than the client viewport is governed by the standard scrollbar and the root viewport model, with the standard `ResizeGrabber` at the frame corner or scrollbar junction.
- A live screen is one sample of a moving system. A host publishes each new reading in place, running the one model-to-controls derivation the constructor runs; it never rebuilds the composition, which would discard the reader's place in it every sample. What survives a refresh is what the reader chose — the selected view, every view's scroll offset, keyboard focus and its list position, the last pointer position, and any move, resize or thumb drag in flight. What is dropped is what names a row that may now be a different object: row selection, pointer hover, and any half-finished press, so a press begun on one row can never complete against the row that replaced it.
- A focused list position is clamped into the new content and the active offset re-ranged through the same clamp a view switch uses, so a shortened list leaves neither past its end. An emptied view stays valid and renderable with nothing to activate.
- A reading with no wired measurement renders honestly — the unmeasured track, no fabricated fill — never a fabricated number.
- A screen composes controls and emits typed actions. It never re-derives a control's painting, layout, hit-testing or keyboard handling, and never enforces authority itself.

The Switchboard screen is the largest composition built this way; its sections, chrome and data sources are specified in `plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md`.

## 18. Rendering Examples in Text

These examples describe shape and state. They are not implementation syntax.

### Idle primary button

```text
[ Restart ]
quiet plate + accent rim
```

### Recommended action under memory pressure

```text
[ Sleep App ]
left memory rail + warm rim
```

### Running job action

```text
[ Pause ]
lower heat seam follows job progress
```

### Destructive recovery action

```text
[ Force Action ]
recovery latch + danger rim + deliberate press
```

### Tray signal with multiple states

```text
[ Signals ] 2 jobs + 1 recovery
lower heat seam + recovery bead
```

### Active window furniture

```text
+--[back][close] Switchboard --------[min][restore]--+
| client viewport                                  |^|
|                                                  |#|
|<----------- horizontal thumb ----------->| grip |v|
+---------------------------------------------------+
active Frame Rim + left-justified title + separate hit targets
```

### Inactive window furniture

```text
same geometry + quieter Frame Rim + complete controls
```

## 19. Do and Do Not

### Do

- Use typed Rust state for control state.
- Resolve visuals from `Theme`, `Scale`, and semantic roles.
- Keep layout stable while state indicators react.
- Share constants, metrics, drawing helpers, and semantic mappings.
- Keep live state in view models supplied by services or owning containers.
- Make every state accessible without color or motion.
- Let services enforce authority and return typed results.
- Keep outer frame furniture and its hit map owned by the window manager.
- Keep Close, Minimize, PutToBack, and SizeToggle as distinct typed commands.
- Preserve restored geometry and validate it when the work area or scale changes.
- Share one scrollbar range, mapping, and input implementation across orientations and owners.
- Make the resize grabber and scrollbar thumb visible, focusable where appropriate, and usable at every density.

### Do not

- Hard-code colors, radii, timings, or scale conversions in application controls.
- Duplicate a visual recipe across multiple crates.
- Add a GUI-specific syscall for a control action.
- Make non-GUI code depend on `userland/gui/*`.
- Use random pulsing, idle shimmer, wobble, or layout drift.
- Treat a denied action as a generic disabled state.
- Hide live system information behind an untyped text scrape.
- Add a new public interface solely to make a control easier to draw.
- Let application content paint over or intercept window-manager furniture.
- Treat Close as force termination, or treat Minimize and PutToBack as the same action.
- Duplicate vertical and horizontal scrollbar logic.
- Animate window move, resize, or thumb drag behind the pointer.
- Hide the only resize affordance in a one-pixel invisible border.
- Change the title-bar or client geometry merely because activation, hover, or attention state changed.
- Defer, stub, or no-op any specified input path (most commonly the mouse wheel): a scrollable surface handles keyboard, thumb drag, and the wheel in the same change, never "keyboard now, wheel later".
- Delete a genuinely useful public control or window-furniture API (for example a viewport's `clear_root_viewport`) merely because its in-tree call sites are few; it stays for the developers and complete UIs that depend on it.

---

## 20. Implementation Checklist

A control or control family is ready when the following are true:

- State is represented by small Rust types with clear ownership.
- Visuals resolve from the active `Theme` and `Scale`.
- Drawing uses the shared raster and compositor path.
- The control has dark and light theme coverage.
- High contrast and reduced motion are defined.
- Pointer, keyboard, and focus behavior are specified.
- Authority-denied, pending, failed-closed, and destructive states are specified where relevant.
- Progress and pressure state come from typed models.
- Tests cover measurement, state transitions, theme switching, reduced motion, and denied actions.
- Documentation explains the control's public behavior and the meaning of each state.
- Window-frame tests cover active, inactive, attention, maximize, restore, minimize, put-to-back, cooperative close, and disabled command states.
- Move, resize, and scrollbar-thumb tests cover pointer capture, cancellation, exact pointer tracking, and constraint clamping.
- Scrollbar tests cover zero overflow, proportional thumb math, minimum thumb size, line and page steps, range changes during drag, both orientations, and keyboard access.
- Restore-rectangle tests cover work-area, display, and logical-scale changes while keeping the title bar reachable.
- Hit-map tests prove that client content cannot receive outer-furniture input and that the resize corner does not overlap either scrollbar.
- Breadcrumb tests cover the trailing crumb refusing activation from every route and refusing focus, elision from the front with the ellipsis activating the newest hidden ancestor, the ellipsis being dropped last so the current crumb survives alone, a focused elided crumb keeping its ring on the ellipsis, a press that slides onto another crumb activating nothing, and `crumb_at`/`crumb_rect` agreeing with the painted layout.
- ActionRail tests cover the shared button height and control gap, full-width items, a rail too short drawing only whole items with hit-testing agreeing, keyboard focus movement reporting the two item rectangles, a denied item keeping its Authority Mark, and the Edge Wake lighting only when asked.
- Toolbar tests cover a wide strip seating every tool and reserving nothing, a narrow strip seating whole tools only inside its bounds, nothing outside the strip or on an affordance slot hit-testing to a tool, a chevron drawn only where there is something that way, a press stepping exactly one tool and a held press repeating until the offset reaches a bound, the wheel scrolling and a full strip ignoring it, keyboard focus scrolling a tool into view, a band too narrow for one tool showing and offering nothing, and the render-equivalence gate comparing the offset but not the press latch.
- TableHeader tests cover a header and its rows resolving identical column spans across a row-state change, a reported sort never reordering or redrawing until `set_sort` commits one, a committed sort that differs from the request being what is drawn, an already-sorted column flipping order, a fixed column emitting nothing, and a denied column keeping its title and its layout.
- Text-fitting tests (§11A) cover a newline forcing a break and a blank line between paragraphs surviving, a paragraph's last permitted line ending at its own break rather than running the next one into it, no laid-out line ever drawing a newline or overflowing its column, a wrapped line locating itself in the caller's own string, and a prose control's measured height at a width being exactly what its paint then draws.
- TextArea tests cover the wrap itself, Enter inserting a newline and never submitting, read-only and denied boxes refusing every edit, Up and Down walking visual lines and keeping their column, Home/End on the visual line against Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End on the text, a selection spanning a break being replaced whole, a click landing on the line it fell on and clamping to that line's visible text, the viewport following the caret while the wheel moves it alone, the scrollbar appearing exactly when the text outgrows the box, a wrapped placeholder and a wrapped message, and the render-equivalence gate comparing the viewport but not the goal column.

## 21. Acceptance Criteria for Reactive Alloy

Reactive Alloy succeeds when a user can answer these questions without reading a manual:

- What is active?
- What changed?
- What is under pressure?
- What action is safe?
- What action is consequential?
- What action is blocked by authority?
- What will keep running if I leave this panel?
- Which window is active?
- How do I close, minimize, put to back, maximize, restore, or resize this window?
- Will Close ask the application to finish safely, or is a separate force action required?
- Where am I in vertically or horizontally scrolled content, and how much remains?
- Will the size toggle return me to the window's previous usable rectangle?

The design is allowed to be rich. It is not allowed to be noisy. TAIRiX controls should feel grounded, typed, secure, and alive at the edges.
