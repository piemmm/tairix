//! `ARXFS` root-partition authoring.
//!
//! The root partition is a genuine encrypted `ARXFS` volume laid down by
//! the real driver (`tairix-drv-fs-arxfs`) and pre-populated with the
//! authoritative top-level layout: exactly `/System`, `/Users`, `/Apps`,
//! and `/Storage`. It is the **writable** volume mounted as `/`, so under
//! `/System` it carries **only** the writable-state subtree
//! ([`WRITABLE_SYSTEM_SUBDIRS`]: `Logs`, `Settings`, and `Security`) — the
//! immutable `/System` content (`Kernel`, `Drivers`, `Libraries`, …) lives on
//! the separate read-only `ARXFSSystem` volume that is mounted *over* this
//! one at `/System`, so duplicating it here would be dead weight and a second
//! copy that could drift.
//! The user and group databases under `/System/Security`, the first user's
//! home, and the mount policies are the installer's first-boot job —
//! the image ships the skeleton the installer fills in. A **debug** image
//! ([`crate::ImageProfile::Debug`]) additionally seeds a pre-authored
//! `/System/Security/Users` database **and** the matching
//! `/System/Security/Groups` registry so the login prompt is usable and the
//! kernel can build its identity table without running the installer; an
//! installer image ships neither.
//!
//! `ARXFS` has no plaintext mode: the volume is provisioned under a
//! caller-supplied volume key, and mounting it requires that key. The
//! image builder draws a fresh random key per image and hands it back to
//! the operator (`crate::build_rpi_image`); it is never stored inside the
//! image.
