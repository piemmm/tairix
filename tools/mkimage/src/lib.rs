//! Platform image builders for TAIRiX.
//!
//! `tairix-mkimage` authors flashable images in pure Rust: the partition
//! contents are laid down by the **real** in-tree filesystem drivers — the
//! same code the booted system mounts the volumes with — so the image
//! author and its consumer can never drift. There is no
//! shelling out to `parted`/`mkfs`/`xorriso`.
//!
//! ## `images/tairix-aarch64-rpi.img` (`plans/PI.md` P9)
//!
//! [`build_rpi_image`] assembles the flashable Raspberry Pi 4 SD image:
//!
//! - **MBR** ([`tairix_syshelp::assemble_disk`]): three primary partitions,
//!   all 1 MiB-aligned and back to back.
//! - **Boot partition** ([`fatboot`], FAT32, [`BOOT_PART_SECTORS`]): the
//!   pinned third-party firmware blobs ([`firmware`]),
//!   the generated `config.txt`, and `kernel8.img` — the freestanding
//!   aarch64 `tairix-kernel` ELF flattened by [`elfflat`].
//! - **`/System` partition** ([`rootfs::build_system_partition`], read-only
//!   `ARXFS`): the signed driver and program bundles and the discovered
//!   system payload, in whole 32 MiB grains and at most one grain more than
//!   they need ([`tairix_syshelp::build_system_volume`]).
//! - **Root partition** ([`rootfs`], `ARXFS`, [`ROOT_PART_SECTORS`]): an
//!   encrypted volume carrying the directory skeleton. Its
//!   volume key is **derived from a passphrase**: the
//!   build provisions an
//!   [`UnlockDescriptor`] (a
//!   per-volume random salt + PBKDF2 iteration count), derives the volume
//!   key from the profile's [`passphrase_for`] under it, provisions the
//!   root with that key, and lays the plaintext descriptor on the boot
//!   partition
//!   ([`fatboot::ROOT_UNLOCK_NAME`]) so the bootstrap can re-derive the key
//!   before mounting. The passphrase itself is never stored in the image.
//!
//! Two [`ImageProfile`]s exist, and both seed **human accounts only**: the
//! system/service identity is compiled into the kernel
//! (`tairix_users::system_accounts` / `system_groups`, `plans/USERS.md`)
//! and never written to disk. **Installer** is the shippable form: it
//! seeds an *empty* users database (the installer authors the first human
//! user on first boot), and its encrypted root is unlocked by a **blank**
//! passphrase ([`INSTALLER_PASSPHRASE`]) the bootstrap auto-enters with no
//! prompt, so a fresh install boots straight into the installer. **Debug**
//! is the development form: it seeds an interactive `root`/`root`
//! administrator ([`DEBUG_USERNAME`]/[`DEBUG_PASSWORD`], uid
//! [`DEBUG_UID`], salted and hashed per build), and its encrypted root is
//! unlocked by the matching `root` passphrase ([`DEBUG_PASSPHRASE`], typed
//! at the `Root passphrase:` prompt), so the login prompt is usable
//! without running the installer. A debug image must never ship.
//!
//! The builder is driven by `cargo xtask image --target aarch64-rpi` (or
//! `cargo xtask build --target aarch64-rpi`) and by the `tairix-mkimage`
//! binary directly; see `docs/src/install/raspberry_pi.md`.
