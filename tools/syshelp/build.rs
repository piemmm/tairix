//! Discover the program bundles' `Help/` trees and `Resources/` files
//! from the source tree and emit them as embedded `[HelpFile]` /
//! `[ResourceFile]` tables.
//!
//! The image builder plants each bundle's internationalised help onto the
//! read-only `/System/<store>/<name>.app/Help/<locale>/<file>` store, and
//! each app's bundle resources onto
//! `/System/<store>/<name>.app/Resources/<file>`, where `<store>` is the
//! store the bundle's own declared kind installs it to. The *source of truth* for
//! both is the bundle's own on-disk directory — never a hand-maintained
//! per-bundle list in the image builder, which would force an edit to a
//! central file every time a bundle is added (the duplication the charter
//! forbids). This script walks the app roots, finds every
//! `Help/<locale>/<doc>.md` and every `Resources/<file>`, and generates an
//! `include_bytes!` row per file, so adding a bundle's payload is dropping
//! files on disk — it is rediscovered on the next build.
//!
//! A build script is host-only build tooling: a genuine build-environment
//! failure (a missing `OUT_DIR`, an unreadable source tree) fails the build
//! loudly rather than emitting a silently-incomplete image.
//!
//! Alongside the per-bundle help and resource families, this script also
//! discovers the desktop's graphics assets — the icon class masters under
//! `lib/icon/assets/`, the wallpaper masters under `lib/wallpaper/assets/`,
//! and the cursor sets under `lib/cursor/assets/` — and emits one
//! `[GraphicsFile]` table for the image builder to plant under
//! `/System/Graphics`. All three are single, non-per-bundle trees walked by
//! the same `GRAPHICS_FAMILIES` table and loop; a family is either flat
//! (icons) or files its assets one directory level deep in categories
//! (wallpapers, cursor sets), which is one field on the family rather than
//! a second walk. Each asset is validated against its own family's contract
//! (`tairix_icon`/`tairix_wallpaper`/`tairix_cursor`) as it is discovered:
//! a name a consumer could never resolve, an illegal category directory, an
//! over-large file, or two files in one directory claiming one asset id
//! fails the build closed rather than shipping artwork that would silently
//! render as a fallback glyph or never be offered.
