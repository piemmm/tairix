//! Build-discovered system payload (command-app Help documents and
//! `Resources/` files, plus the desktop's graphics assets) for image
//! authoring.
//!
//! TAIRiX ships each command app's internationalised command help as a
//! structured-Markdown `Help/` tree on the read-only `/System` volume, at
//! `/System/<store>/<name>.app/Help/<locale>/<doc>.md` (`plans/APPS.md`), and
//! each app's bundle resources (e.g. `lspci`'s compiled ID-database table,
//! `plans/DEVICES.md`) at `/System/<store>/<name>.app/Resources/<file>`,
//! where `<store>` is the store the bundle's own manifest kind installs it
//! to — `Commands` for a command app, `Applications` for a graphical
//! application, `Services` for a service. It also
//! ships the desktop's graphics assets — the icon class masters, the shipped
//! wallpaper masters, the cursor sets and the screensaver previews — under
//! `/System/Graphics`. The image builder (`tools/mkimage`) and the QEMU image
//! fixture must plant all of these onto the volume they author.
//!
//! The source of truth for each family is its own on-disk directory. This
//! crate's build script walks every program crate under `userland/`
//! (`bundles::program_crates`; each bundle named by its crate's
//! `AppInfo.toml`, never the crate directory) for `Help/` and `Resources/`,
//! and walks each single-tree graphics asset family — `lib/icon/assets/` for
//! the desktop icon masters, `lib/wallpaper/assets/` for the shipped
//! wallpaper masters, `lib/wallpaper/screensavers/` for the screensaver
//! previews — through one shared table and loop, embedding each
//! discovered file as a row in [`HELP_FILES`] / [`RESOURCE_FILES`] /
//! [`GRAPHICS_FILES`]. The planters iterate that discovered data — **never** a
//! hand-maintained list that a new file would force an edit to (the
//! duplication the charter forbids). Adding a bundle's payload is dropping
//! files under `<root>/<name>/Help/<locale>/` or `<root>/<name>/Resources/`,
//! adding an icon is dropping a `<asset-id>.png` or `<asset-id>.svg` under
//! `lib/icon/assets/`, and adding a wallpaper is dropping a
//! `.jpg`/`.jpeg`/`.png` under `lib/wallpaper/assets/`; the next build
//! rediscovers them. Payload is therefore authored in exactly one place and
//! never hardcoded into a binary or copied into the image builder.
//!
//! Each graphics family's files are additionally validated against that
//! family's own contract (`tairix_icon` for icons, `tairix_wallpaper` for
//! wallpapers) as they are discovered, so a name a consumer could never
//! resolve or an over-large file fails the build closed rather than shipping
//! an icon that would silently render as a fallback glyph or a wallpaper
//! that would never be offered.
//!
//! Both authors build their disk through this crate: [`build_system_volume`]
//! counts and plants the `/System` volume's files in one walk and chooses its
//! length, and [`assemble_disk`] lays the partitions behind the MBR. Neither
//! author keeps its own copy of the file set, the sizing, or the layout.
//!
//! The payload is `&'static [u8]` bytes embedded at build time, so this crate
//! is `no_std` and depends on no app crate: both the host image builder and
//! the freestanding QEMU fixture (which also links into the aarch64 guest
//! tail) consume it unchanged.
