//! `cargo xtask fuzz` — drive the in-tree fuzz harnesses.
//!
//! TAIRiX does not pull in an external fuzz runner: the
//! per-crate harnesses are seeded, allocation-free Rust tests, which the
//! charter sanctions as the "equivalent in-tree harness". This
//! orchestrator is the single place that runs every such harness for a
//! wall-clock budget, so a PR and a nightly soak share one definition of the
//! target set.
//!
//! Each [`Target`] names an existing `cargo test` integration harness. The
//! orchestrator exports `TAIRIX_FUZZ_BUDGET_SECS`, which the harness reads to
//! keep drawing fresh inputs from its continuing PRNG stream until the budget
//! elapses (a plain `cargo test` leaves the variable unset and runs the fast,
//! fixed-iteration smoke sweep instead). It also exports a per-harness PRNG
//! seed (`commands::seed`): by default a *fresh* seed each run, so two soaks
//! never replay the same input stream; with `--seed N`, a deterministic
//! seed that reproduces a logged crash. The chosen seed is logged with each
//! job. A harness that crashes, hangs, or fails its invariant fails the
//! command: it fails closed.
//!
//! Adding a harness means adding a [`Target`] here, never teaching `ci`
//! about it directly. The burn-down now covers the wire decoders,
//! the syscall dispatcher, the `lib/net` protocol parsers, the
//! capability-checked IPC port endpoint, and the realm protocol's decoders,
//! handshake, and record transport.
