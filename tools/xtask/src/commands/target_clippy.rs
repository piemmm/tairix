//! The bare-metal `clippy` passes: lint the code the host pass cannot see.
//!
//! `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` builds every crate for the *host*.
//! Almost nothing that actually ships is compiled by that pass: a kernel
//! subsystem, an architecture backend, a driver, a system service and an
//! application body are all reached only when the crate is built for a
//! freestanding triple — most of them literally behind the `freestanding` cfg
//! each crate's `build.rs` sets when `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS == "none"`, whose
//! host arm is an inert stub. The image and QEMU stages then *compile* those
//! bodies but never lint them, so a lint in shipped code could never fail CI.
//!
//! This module closes that hole by running the same `-D warnings` clippy once
//! per target over the crates that target is built from. Together with the
//! host pass, every Tier-1 target's configuration is linted.
//!
//! ## The product passes
//!
//! Per freestanding Tier-1 target ([`PieArch`]), one pass per **stratum** of
//! the product tree. The selection is derived, never listed: it is every
//! workspace member the image pipeline cross-compiles — less
//!
//! - **`tools/*`**, host-only build orchestration (this crate included) that
//!   never runs on the machine under test, and
//! - **`tests/*`**, test support rather than product — covered by the vertical
//!   passes below, and
//! - a **foreign architecture backend**: `kernel/arch/<other>` cannot compile
//!   for this target, so only the backend named by [`backend_dir`] and the
//!   architecture-neutral `kernel/arch/api` are in the pass.
//!
//! The stratum split is not cosmetic. Cargo unifies features across every
//! package named in one invocation, so selecting the kernel binary alongside
//! the userland programs turns on the `program` features of their shared
//! dependencies and links `lib/rt`'s `#[global_allocator]` and
//! `#[panic_handler]` into the kernel — a duplicate `panic_impl` lang item.
//! The image pipeline builds the kernel and the programs in separate cargo
//! invocations for exactly that reason; the lint passes mirror it.
//!
//! ## The debug-image pass
//!
//! The kernel stratum is linted twice per target: once as the shippable
//! `installer` image builds it, and once with the debug image's
//! `watchdog-diagnostics` feature on. Those bodies exist in no other
//! configuration, so the second pass is the only thing that lints the debug
//! image at all.
//!
//! ## The `wasm32` pass
//!
//! The browser target builds only one piece of product code — its own Arch HAL
//! backend, which no bare-metal triple can compile — so `wasm32` gets a pass
//! over that backend and the architecture-neutral `kernel/arch/api`, plus the
//! browser verticals from `wasm_tests`' own table. Without it the `wasm32`
//! backend would be the one Tier-1 configuration nothing ever lints.
//!
//! ## What is *not* here: the QEMU guests
//!
//! The enrolled QEMU guests under `tests/integration/` are test support, not
//! product, and they are **not** linted by this stage. That is a known gap,
//! staged in `plans/CODEVERIFY.md` with the commands and counts: the
//! guests are near-identical triplicates per architecture, so cleaning them
//! means first hoisting their shared logic into `tests/integration/harness`.
//!
//! `--all-targets` is deliberately absent throughout: a bare-metal target has
//! no test harness, so the unit-test targets cannot link there. The host pass
//! lints those.
