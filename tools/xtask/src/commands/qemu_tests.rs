//! QEMU integration-test driver invoked by `cargo xtask test --qemu`.
//!
//! the charter mandates that the QEMU tests share the same orchestrator
//! as host-side tests and that each QEMU run has a *strict* per-test
//! timeout with **no retries**. This module enforces both: it builds the
//! enrolled kernels per target triple, then drives each one through
//! [`tairix_qemu::Runner::run`], failing the whole `xtask test` invocation
//! if any guest fails or times out.
//!
//! The guests run **concurrently** through the shared weighted-concurrency
//! runner ([`super::parallel`]): each enrolment is independent (its own
//! per-binary backing images, a `-serial stdio` console, and a unique unix
//! monitor socket), so the only resource they contend for is host CPU. The
//! runner charges a uniprocessor guest two units (its vCPU plus emulator/I/O
//! work) and an SMP guest the whole budget — so an SMP guest runs alone,
//! because a co-scheduled SMP guest starves so badly it trips its own in-guest
//! lockup watchdog. The budget is one third of the host's logical CPUs:
//! deliberate headroom (a QEMU guest is far heavier than its lone vCPU thread,
//! and each guest runs its own real-time watchdogs) so guests are never
//! oversubscribed into missing their internal deadlines. Within that budget a
//! few uniprocessor guests overlap; each guest's deadline is itself an
//! *inactivity* budget, not a total-runtime one ([`tairix_qemu`]), so a guest
//! that runs a little slower co-scheduled keeps emitting serial output and is
//! never mistaken for a hung one. See [`run_once`].

    //   accepted `DO SUPPRESS GO AHEAD`, named its terminal type, reported its
    //   window over NAWS, agreed `WILL LINEMODE`, stated a `MODE` mask and
    //   exported its SLC table. A client that connected but ignored the
    //   negotiation never sees it, so the script never types the next line.
    // * `wire::TELNET_ECHO` — the peer's upper-cased answer to the probe line
    //   the script then types. It proves the bytes made a full round trip
    //   through the telnet data path in both directions; the client's own
    //   local echo of the probe is lower case, so it cannot be mistaken for
    //   the answer.
    // * `TELNET_QUIT_SEQUENCE` — the default escape character `^]` followed by
    //   the interpreter's `quit`, so the escape recognition and the `telnet>`
    //   command interpreter are exercised live and the tool exits cleanly of
    //   its own accord rather than being killed.
    //
    // The guest audit sink arms on `telnet`'s own audited `exit`
    // (`comm=telnet`) and reports PASS on the **next** audited `exit` — the
    // shell's, typed only after the echo marker appeared — so the round trip
    // provably reached the transcript before the run ended. The harness
    // additionally requires the peer's own verdict, which names the first step
    // the client failed to complete, so neither side can pass alone. A

    // *and* the framebuffer display-service bundle in its `Drivers/` store —
    // plus an attached `ramfb` display, a `virtio-keyboard-device`, and a
    // `virtio-mouse-device`. With the display attached the framebuffer boot
    // console comes up, the boot publishes the scan-out surface as the boot
    // display node, and the video console is the *only* console (the UART
    // carries the debug log alone), so the whole dialogue is typed at the
    // seat keyboard, never over serial. The boot binds the virtio-blk root
    // and discovers the virtio-input nodes; the unlock kthread mounts the
    // read-only `/System` volume and its autoload hook scans that volume's
    // signed store **before** any passphrase prompt, verifies each bundle
    // against the kernel's embedded driver trust anchor, matches the
    // keyboard/mouse bundles to the virtio-input nodes and the display
    // bundle to the boot display node, and spawns each into its own
    // user-space process with exactly its node's resource grants. Once both
    // input-driver instances have armed their interrupts (the audited
    // `irq_bind` syscall, twice), the runner types the fixture passphrase +
    // Enter at the virtio keyboard (paced `sendkey`s; the characters buffer
    // as console type-ahead until the video-console passphrase prompt drains
    // them); the first delivered keystroke emits the `kind=key` witness,
    // after which the runner injects the mouse motion. PASS once the
    // kernel-side audit sink has seen all four witnesses: `InputDelivered`
    // for both kinds (an autoloaded *user-space* driver instance delivered
    // each input class), `UsersDbLoaded` (the typed passphrase unlocked the
    // encrypted root end to end), and `CallEndpointCreated` for the reserved
    // `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` (the autoloaded display service came up on its
    // granted surface and bound its rendezvous under
    // `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`).
    //
    // D7d-2 grows the run into the desktop launch: after the unlock, the
    // second typed step (keyed on the `UsersDbLoaded` serial witness)
    // types the fixture account's `root`/`root` at login's video-console
    // prompt — the disk plants `os.loginType text`, so login drops to the
    // account's shell — and then the `desktop` command word, which the
    // shell resolves in the system application store and spawns: the desktop is
    // started exactly the way a user starts it from the command line.
    //
    // AW3 (`plans/APPWIN.md`) grows the presented desktop into the full
    // click-through: the session's one-shot `DESKTOP_REVEALED` witness
    // keys the first screendump (the dark composited desktop) and
    // the click on the autostarted file manager's own icon-bar slot (the
    // guest applies injected events strictly in device order, so the click
    // needs no extra gate); that click opens its window over the
    // reserved window rendezvous, and the endpoint's first *reply* on
    // serial gates the in-window click. From there every stage is keyed on
    // the kernel/ipc `MessageDelivered` records the desktop's app-ward
    // event deliveries emit — the shared interaction contract in the test
    // crate's lib target: delivery 2 (Focus + Pressed from the window
    // click) keys the second screendump (the served window on the dark
    // desktop), and a handshake click (delivery 3, injected only after
    // delivery 2 appeared and held while the second dump is pending) is
    // the wake boundary the terminal stage gates on.
    //
    // AW4 then takes the run into the windowed terminal: keyed on the
    // handshake's own delivery, the script clicks the taskbar's Library
    // button (the program-library popup opens over the catalog the guest
    // session merged from the planted machine store — `plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md`
    // T5) and then the popup's "Terminal" entry (spawning the terminal
    // bundle, which spawns the user's shell over one kernel pseudo-terminal
    // — `plans/PTY.md` — and serves its window at the second cascade slot);
    // the third window-frame map (the terminal's create) gates the
    // terminal-window click, after which the runner types `sleep 3600` +
    // Enter at the seat keyboard once the guest's terminal-focus marker
    // appears. The guest PASS gate latches the `appmgr` load of
    // `/System/Commands/sleep.app` — `sleep` is loaded only by the shell running
    // the typed command, so this witness is uniquely attributable (no
    // fragile delivery count), and it proves the whole keyboard → session →
    // library popup → terminal → pty → shell → load round trip. The runner
    // fails any run whose script or dumps did not complete.
    //
    // The pty stage then proves the cooked-mode line discipline end to end
    // (`plans/PTY.md`): `sleep 3600` is a *blocking* foreground job, so
    // once the guest witnesses its spawn it emits a marker gating a
    // `Ctrl-C` injection (the ETX byte the terminal encodes as `0x03`);
    // the pty's cooked `^C` signals the foreground `sleep` dead, the shell
    // — unblocked from its `wait` — reads and spawns a recovered `true`,
    // and that second spawn is the guest's job-control witness. A failed
    // interrupt leaves `sleep` blocking past the budget, so the run times
    // out (fail loud).
    // Every click coordinate is computed from the production shell's own
    // layout code (`autoload_desktop_pointer_script`), and the pin move
    // also delivers the `kind=pointer` witness, so the pointer decode path
    // stays separately proven. A 300-second budget covers the boot +
    // bounded PBKDF2 + autoload + driver bring-up + the ~4 s passphrase +
    // ~1 s login typing + session bring-up + the paced click script +
    // both app spawns + the typed command + the pty Ctrl-C job-control

/// coordinates copied from a screenshot. The bar is a desktop surface, never
/// covered by a window, which is why the gesture aims at it: a window's
/// controls would need whatever else is on screen reasoned about first, and
/// the per-control damage under test is the same sink either way.
///

///
/// - The desktop's own reveal witness opens the script, so nothing is injected

/// - The row click waits on the popup's own [`LIBRARY_SHOWN_MARKER`], so the
///   row is on screen before it is pressed.
/// - Everything after the first launch waits on the fixture's own sample
///   record: until that record exists there is no opened window to sweep
///   inside.

/// The final click is what completes the run: it launches the second sample,

///   session announces, so one occurrence is the bar carrying the slot the
///   click aims at. Nothing about a window would do — a desktop component
///   opens none until its slot is pressed.
/// - Each activation's secondary press waits on the session's per-window
///   [`WINDOW_SHOWN_MARKER`] for the manager window it aims at — the witness
///   that a frame carrying that window's painted pixels reached the display. A
///   create reply would say only that the window exists, and the listing
///   arrives on a worker, so anything earlier races the frame the items are
///   in.
/// - Each *Open* row click waits on [`MENU_SHOWN_MARKER`], the session's own
///   witness that a frame carrying the chain went out. It is also the one
///   statement anywhere that the press *reached the item*: the manager asks
///   for a plate only once it has hit-tested an entry under the pointer, so a
///   drawn plate is proof the gesture landed where the reconstruction aimed
///   it, and its absence localises a failure to the aim rather than leaving a
///   silent timeout.
/// - Each later manager window is opened from the same slot rather than by
///   reusing an earlier one, because the viewer's window is placed over the
///   manager window the previous activation was aimed into and a component's
///   slot click opens a window rather than raising one. That click waits on
