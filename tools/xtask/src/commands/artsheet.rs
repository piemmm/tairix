//! `cargo xtask artsheet` implementation.
//!
//! The figure engine's art gate. It walks the shared reference grid
//! (`tairix_wintersun_figure::reference`) — each species' reference figure
//! in every shipped motion, and each species' least, most and two plausible
//! figures walking, at eight phases, facing four ways — renders each cell,
//! measures it, and holds every number against a bound. A reference figure
//! is measured at the three pixel sides the desktop draws a figure at; a
//! walking one at the smallest, which is the readability floor, since what a
//! figure costs is counted in outline points and fill area and neither
//! depends on the side.
//!
//! # Why the golden is a ledger and not a picture
//!
//! A committed PNG reproduces the objection the whole plan is written
//! against: a reviewer cannot read a binary diff, so a regression is
//! invisible until somebody opens the file, and git carries the churn on
//! every rig, clip, shape or palette change. The committed golden is
//! therefore a **text ledger** — identity, a pixel digest, and every
//! measured number per cell — where a change reads as
//! `skate 0.002718 -> 0.014803` in the diff. `--sheets` renders the
//! pictures on demand into the gitignored `images/`, so what a human looks
//! at is always current rather than as-of-last-regeneration.
//!
//! The bare form does both halves: it regenerates the ledger and compares
//! it byte for byte (drift), and it checks the freshly measured numbers
//! against their bounds (correctness). Drift without bounds would admit a
//! regression somebody had regenerated; bounds without drift would admit a
//! change nobody noticed.

# rather than authored, and each has a bound beside its measurement — the
# pose-side ones in `tairix_wintersun_figure::quality`, the pixel-side ones
# in `tools/xtask/src/commands/artsheet.rs`. A bound is never widened to
# admit a change; a number that moves is a change to what a figure does.
#
# A `figure` row is one figure of the grid: its name, its record, and how
# many surfaces and tones it is drawn from. A `preset` row is one figure the
# game ships as a preset, measured in every motion at the readability floor
# and held to every bound there; its cells carry no rows of their own.
# A `motion` row is one shipped clip played by it, with each measurement the
# clip is held to by name, and a gait's authored stride. A `cell` row is one
# rendered frame: its figure, its motion, which of the eight phases, the
# heading it faces, the pixel side it was drawn at, a digest of its pixels,
# and its measurements.
#
# The contact sheets themselves are rendered on demand by
# `cargo xtask artsheet --sheets` into the gitignored `images/artsheet/`,
# one per figure, motion and side, phases across and headings down, so the
# picture a reviewer judges is always current rather than
# as-of-last-regeneration.
