//! `cargo xtask bench` implementation: host microbenchmarks for the raster
//! and compositor families.
//!
//! The desktop's redraw cost is per-pixel work — a blend, a blur tap, a
//! resample tap, a scan-out encode — so the numbers that matter are
//! nanoseconds per pixel and nanoseconds per frame. This command produces
//! them by running the *production* entry points (`lib/raster`,
//! `lib/display`'s scan-out encode, and a real `tairix_wm::Compositor` over a
//! window stack), never a re-implementation of them.
//!
//! # Not a gate
//!
//! Wall-clock timings are load-dependent, so nothing here is a pass/fail
//! threshold and no test asserts an elapsed time. The output is evidence for
//! a completion report; the regression gates are the deterministic work
//! counters (pixels blended, rectangles presented) elsewhere. CI may run this
//! only as a smoke check that the harness itself still produces a number for
//! every family.
//!
//! # One timing loop
//!
//! The measurement is `lib/cpuops`'s existing `BenchHarness` — bounded,
//! one-shot, median-of-rounds, `black_box`ed — with a host clock injected
//! through its `CycleCounter` seam. There is deliberately no second timing
//! loop here.
