//! Cross-compile and sign the autoloaded `/System/Drivers/` bundles the
//! flashable Raspberry Pi image ships (`plans/PI.md` P10 D4).
//!
//! `tools/mkimage` is a pure library: it plants bundle *bytes* into the
//! read-only `/System` store but never drives `cargo`. This module is the
//! orchestration half — it builds each user-space driver crate
//! position-independent for the freestanding `aarch64-unknown-none` target,
//! converts the linked PIE ELF to an `rxe` image (relocated for the
//! production user-image bias and stamped with the kernel's compiled-in
//! syscall CFI tag), and wraps that `rxe` as the signed payload of a
//! `kind = UserSpace` [`DriverManifest`]. The bundle is signed with the
//! kernel's own driver-signing seed
//! ([`build_support::KERNEL_DRIVER_SIGNING_SEED`], the single source the
//! kernel derives its embedded trust anchor from), so the
//! booted kernel admits it through the signed load gate.
//!
//! The signed-bundle composer and the ELF->rxe converter are the shared
//! definitions the kernel `build.rs` and the autoload fixtures also use
//! (`tairix_itest_harness`), so the wire layout is never
//! re-rolled here. This is host-only build glue; the
//! production image stays Rust-only.
