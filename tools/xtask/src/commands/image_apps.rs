//! Cross-compile, compose, and sign the self-contained application bundles
//! the images ship on the read-only `/System` volume (`plans/APPS.md`
//! deliverable 8): every command app under `/System/Commands/<name>.app/`,
//! every graphical application under `/System/Applications/<name>.app/`, and
//! every service under `/System/Services/<name>.app/`, each a complete
//! on-disk bundle — its signed `AppInfo` and `Run` rxe planted beside its
//! `Help/` tree. Which store a bundle lands in is its manifest's own
//! declared kind, never a list kept here.
//!
//! `tools/mkimage` and the QEMU whole-disk fixture are pure planters: they
//! lay bundle *bytes* onto the volume but never drive `cargo`. This module
//! is the orchestration half — it discovers every program crate's
//! `AppInfo.toml` manifest source by walking the userland crate roots
//! (`tairix_itest_harness::app_image::discover_app_manifests` — never a
//! hand-maintained per-bundle list), compiles each crate's `Run` binary
//! position-independent for the freestanding aarch64 target through the
//! shared `pie_build` recipe, converts the linked PIE ELF to an `rxe`
//! image (relocated for the production user-image bias and stamped with
//! the kernel's compiled-in syscall CFI tag), and composes the bundle's
//! Ed25519-signed wire `AppInfo` over the exact contents the volume ships
//! — the `Run` rxe plus the bundle's discovered `Help/` documents
//! (`tairix_syshelp`), so a tampered file or a swapped capability id fails
//! the verifier closed.
//!
//! Bundles are signed with the dedicated system-app seed
//! ([`build_support::SYSTEM_APP_SIGNING_SEED`]) — a trust domain distinct
//! from the driver-signing seed, so an app-signing authority can never
//! admit a driver. This is host-only build glue; the production image
//! stays Rust-only.
