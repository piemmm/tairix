//! `cargo xtask miri` — run the workspace's `unsafe` cores under an
//! undefined-behaviour oracle.
//!
//! A test suite proves what a program computes; it cannot prove that a raw
//! pointer stayed in bounds, that a slot was initialised before it was read,
//! or that two `&mut` never aliased. Miri interprets the program and checks
//! exactly those, so it is the oracle the hand-written containers need and
//! the ordinary test matrix cannot be.
//!
//! The stage is deliberately narrow. Miri interprets every operation, so
//! pointing it at the whole workspace would cost hours and tell us nothing
//! about the crates that carry no `unsafe` at all. [`TARGETS`] therefore names
//! the crates whose safety rests on a hand-written `unsafe` core, and each of
//! those crates scales its own sweeps down under `cfg(miri)` — the wide input
//! search belongs to the ordinary and budgeted runs; this one is looking for
//! undefined behaviour, which one pass over each code path already exposes.
//!
//! Adding a crate here means adding a [`Target`], never teaching `ci` about it
//! directly.
//!
//! The stage builds for the **host**, so a port's `target_os = "none"` code is
//! never interpreted, and what the `tairix-arch-*` crates are enrolled for is
//! the portable `unsafe` core — the page-table walks, the initial-frame writes
//! — which every host interprets alike. A port that reaches a hardware
//! instruction from a *host* build instead aborts that crate's whole run with
//! "unsupported operation", and only on the machine whose architecture it
//! names: a developer on one arch and a runner on another do not agree.
