//! QEMU runner for TAIRiX integration tests.
//!
//! This crate is the single, documented gateway between the host build and a
//! QEMU process used to execute a kernel-mode integration test. It exists
//! because the charter requires that all tests — including the QEMU-based
//! ones from Stage 2 — run under one orchestrator (`cargo xtask test`) with
//! **no retries** and a **strict timeout**.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! A *QEMU integration test* is a `no_std`, `no_main` kernel binary built for
//! one of the Tier-1 bare-metal targets. The binary signals its result back
//! to the host through an architecture-specific debug-exit device (today only
//! x86_64's `isa-debug-exit`; Stage 3b/3c/3d ports will add their own):
//!
//! * Writing the byte `SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE` (`0x10`) to the device causes QEMU
//!   to exit with status `(0x10 << 1) | 1 == 0x21` (33). The runner treats
//!   this — and **only** this — as success.
//! * Writing any other byte causes QEMU to exit with a different status; the
//!   runner treats every such status as a test failure.
//!
//! The convention is the one popularised by the phil-opp `blog_os` series and
//! is the same one used by `bootimage`. It is encoded as
//! [`Outcome::from_qemu_status`] so the rule lives in exactly one place.
//!
//! # Timeouts and flakiness
//!
//! the charter forbids flaky tests and forbids retries. The runner
//! therefore:
//!
//! * Enforces an *inactivity* deadline supplied by the caller: a guest is
//!   declared hung once it produces no new serial output for the whole
//!   budget. Every line the guest prints resets it, so a guest that is merely
//!   slow (heavily co-scheduled, or on a slow host core) is never killed while
//!   it keeps making progress. That immunity to host load is what lets the
//!   matrix run many guests at once without a slow one degrading into a flaky
//!   timeout. A guest that genuinely falls silent for the budget is
//!   `Outcome::Timeout`, which the runner converts into a failure — never
//!   into a retry.
//! * Enforces an absolute wall-clock ceiling too ([`Spec::runtime_ceiling`]),
//!   because the heartbeat alone cannot bound a guest that keeps *talking*
//!   while making no progress — a service retrying a failed request on a
//!   timer resets the heartbeat forever, and one such guest would otherwise
//!   stall the whole matrix behind it indefinitely. Exceeding it is
//!   `Outcome::RuntimeCeilingExceeded`, reported apart from `Timeout` because
//!   the two describe different faults. A run whose *success* requires long
//!   continuous work — a whole-RAM memtest sweep — declares its own ceiling
//!   ([`Spec::with_runtime_ceiling`]) rather than inheriting the multiple of a
//!   silence budget that describes no part of its work.
//! * Kills (`SIGKILL`) the QEMU child if either deadline is hit so a wedged VM
//!   cannot block subsequent tests.
//! * Inherits QEMU's stdout/stderr through capture so the failure report can
//!   include the full serial log without interleaving with later tests.
//! * Retries interrupted pipe reads, fails immediately on a drain error or
//!   panic, and distinguishes a prematurely closed serial channel from a guest
//!   timeout if QEMU remains running; marker-gated input can therefore never
//!   fail with a misleading diagnosis because the host stopped observing
//!   output.
//!
//! # Per-architecture surface
//!
//! Architecture-specific defaults (RAM size, OVMF/UEFI flags, debug-exit
//! device) and argv assembly live in dedicated modules (`x86_64` today;
//! Stage 3b/3c/3d add `aarch64`, `riscv64`, `wasm32`). The generic types in
//! this file — [`Outcome`], [`Arch`], [`Spec`], [`Runner`] — are
//! architecture-neutral; [`Runner::run`] dispatches into the per-arch module
//! through a single `match` on [`Spec::arch`].
