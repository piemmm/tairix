# AGENTS.md — TAIRiX Engineering Charter

This document is the **binding contract** for every AI agent (and human contributor)
who works on TAIRiX. It is **not advisory**. Any pull request, commit, or generated
file that violates these rules is to be rejected and reworked.

If a rule is ambiguous, stop and ask. **Do not guess. Do not invent shortcuts.
Do not "just make it work".**

---

## 1. Project Identity

- **Name:** TAIRiX
- **Language:** Rust only. **Every line of TAIRiX is Rust**, and this binds
  every contributor, human or AI. The *only* exception is small, individually
  justified, header-documented and reviewed assembly fragments where the
  architecture *strictly* requires it (CPU bring-up, MMU/TLB/context-switch
  primitives the silicon cannot express in Rust). There are no others.
  - **Do not write C or C++ as part of TAIRiX** — no `.c`/`.h`/`.cc`/`.cpp`
    source, header, or build glue is a legitimate deliverable. The C-language
    surface (§9, §16.4) is an outward-facing contract for **third-party**
    developers to call `abi-v1` from *their own* projects, not a licence to
    author C here. If a task seems to require writing C, you have misread it —
    stop and ask (§15.7).
  - The only committed C artefacts are the host-only items §9/§16.4 enumerate:
    the **generated** `include/` headers (emitted from `lib/abi`, never
    hand-edited), the `tools/cc/` build glue, and the host-only C-ABI
    conformance fixture it drives — produced, pinned, and audited there.
- **Targets (Tier-1):**
  - `x86_64-tairix-none` (BIOS + UEFI PCs) — a first-party hard-float target
    spec in `.cargo/`, because rustc's `x86_64-unknown-none` is soft-float and
    a target's float ABI cannot be changed through `-C target-feature`
  - `aarch64-unknown-none` (Raspberry Pi 3/4/5, generic ARMv8)
  - `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf` (QEMU virt, SiFive boards)
  - `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (browser, Chrome-class environment)
- **Focus:** Security, correctness, performance, multi-user, multi-core,
  modular drivers, modular scheduler, modular architecture support, and an
  optional RISC OS-style desktop with a compositing window manager.
  The desktop is a session frontend, not a kernel requirement: a
  headless build must remain a first-class configuration (§17).
  TAIRiX must be **secure *and* fast**: security and correctness are the
  floor (§2.1, §2.5–§2.7), and within that floor execution speed is a
  first-class goal, not an afterthought (§2.16).

## 2. Non-Negotiable Rules

These are absolute. They override any local convenience.

1. **No hacks.** If a problem cannot be solved cleanly, raise an issue. Never
   paper over it with a `TODO`, `unsafe { /* trust me */ }`, sleep loop,
   global mutable static, retry-until-it-works, or commented-out test.
2. **No code duplication, ever.** If you find yourself writing similar code
   twice, extract a crate in `lib/` (see §6). Duplication is a review blocker.
   **This binds constants and other data as much as logic.** A value that is
   the same across two or more places by definition — a shared layout offset,
   stack size, address bias, capability set, magic number, table, or any other
   constant that must stay identical — is defined **once** and imported,
   never copy-pasted into sibling files. Two sibling implementations carrying
   their own private copy of a constant that will always be equal (for example
   the user-stack/MMIO-window/canary constants duplicated across
   `init_spawn.rs`, `init_spawn_riscv64.rs`, and `init_spawn_x86_64.rs`) is the
   duplication this rule forbids: hoist the shared value into the one place
   both depend on (a common module or a `lib/*` crate) so a change to it cannot
   silently diverge. A constant lives beside one implementation only when it is
   *genuinely* that implementation's own (an architecture-specific register
   layout, a per-board MMIO base discovered at runtime), not a value that
   merely happens to coincide today.
   *Carve-out:* Parallel implementations of the same trait — two
   schedulers, two architecture backends, two filesystems, two window
   managers — are not duplication; they are the deliberate shape of
   the modularity contracts in §17. Do not "deduplicate" sibling
   implementations by collapsing them behind `cfg` switches.
3. **No bloat.** Every type, trait, function, file, and folder must justify its
   existence. "Helper" modules that wrap one-liners are forbidden.
4. **No interface creep.** Public interfaces (kernel syscalls, driver traits,
   IPC, ABI) are versioned and frozen on release. Adding a method "to make
   access easier" is forbidden. Extend via a new versioned trait/interface.
5. **All unit tests must pass on every change. No exceptions.**
   - "Pre-existing failure" is not an excuse. Fix it or revert.
   - Disabling, ignoring (`#[ignore]`), or weakening a test is forbidden unless
     the test itself is provably wrong, and only with an accompanying issue
     and replacement test.
6. **Senior-developer quality only.** Code must be reviewed against the same
   bar a senior systems engineer would apply at a kernel vendor. If you would
   be embarrassed to defend a line in a code review, rewrite it.
7. **Security is the default, not a feature.** Every interface, syscall, IPC
   endpoint, and filesystem op is permission-checked. "Open by default" APIs
   are forbidden.
8. **Documentation is part of the code.** A change that updates behaviour
   without updating its docs (rustdoc + the relevant `docs/` page) is incomplete.
9. **No `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in production paths.** They are
   permitted in tests and in clearly-marked unrecoverable boot-time invariants
   (documented with `// SAFETY-INVARIANT:` and reviewed).
10. **`unsafe` requires:**
    - A `// SAFETY:` block immediately above, explaining every invariant.
    - A unit test (or model check) covering the invariants.
    - Encapsulation behind a safe API. No `unsafe` leaks across crate boundaries.
11. **Code must be self-documenting, and comments are terse.** Write code
    clearly enough that it explains itself with the comments stripped out:
    intention-revealing names, small single-purpose functions, obvious control
    flow, and types that make illegal states unrepresentable. If a comment is
    the only thing that makes a line understandable, the code is wrong —
    rewrite the code, do not add the comment. Comments are reserved for *why*
    (rationale, invariants, references, `// SAFETY:`), never for restating
    *what* the code already says. This does not relax §2.8: rustdoc and
    `docs/` pages remain mandatory.
    - **Terse: the required information, then stop.** A comment is a line or
      two of *why* — never a paragraph, an essay, a tutorial, a narration of
      the change that produced the code, or a restatement of the rustdoc above
      it. Decorative banners and section headers carry no information and are
      not written. Prefer *no* comment wherever the code already reads clearly;
      that is the normal outcome, not an exception. rustdoc stays mandatory
      (§2.8, §13) and is held to the same terseness — mandatory is not a
      licence to waffle.
    - **The charter sets the bar, never the file in front of you.** Verbose
      prose already sitting in a source file is unswept waffle
      (`plans/WAFFLE.md`), not a precedent, a house style, or permission to
      write more of it. "The rest of the file does it", "I matched the
      surrounding style", and "the original author explained it at length" are
      not justifications: this rule outranks every local convention, in every
      file, however much prose you found there. Trim the waffle in the lines
      your change touches (§2.18) and never add to it; a whole-file or
      crate-wide sweep is the staged `plans/WAFFLE.md` work and is not smuggled
      into an unrelated diff.
    - Here "references" means a pointer to something *outside* this charter that
      a reader cannot derive from the code — an external spec or hardware manual
      (Intel SDM, PCI, virtio, a NIST publication), an algorithm paper, an RFC,
      or another file/plan in this tree (`plans/PI.md`, a `docs/.../*-spec.md`,
      a sibling module). It does **not** mean citing `AGENTS.md` itself.
    - A comment MUST NOT cite a charter section number (`AGENTS.md §5.4`, `§2.9`,
      `sec.5.4`, "Section 5.4", or any equivalent, including a bare trailing
      `(§5.4)`). The rule already lives in this file, so the citation restates
      *what* the rule is, never *why* the code does what it does, and is exactly
      the noise this section forbids. State the reason in plain prose instead:
      keep "fail closed", "zeroed on drop before the buffer leaves scope", "no
      ambient authority"; drop the trailing "(§5.4)". Where the charter itself
      is the subject, name it in prose ("the charter forbids this duplication"),
      never by section number.
    - The sole exception is provenance a *generator* emits to record which
      charter section governs a generated artefact (the `include/` C-header
      banners); that lives in the generator, never in hand-written code. A
      runtime diagnostic that points a developer at the rule they violated
      (a CI-check error message, an assertion message) is program output, not a
      comment, and may name the section.
12. **Roll your own; do not trust external code.** Where it is feasible to do
    so cleanly, prefer a first-party implementation in this workspace over a
    dependency on an external crate. Every external dependency is code we
    neither wrote nor fully control: it widens the trusted computing base,
    the attack surface, and the audit burden, and it can disappear, regress,
    or turn hostile. Default to writing it ourselves.
    - Each external dependency must justify its existence in review and be
      pinned, license-checked, and advisory-audited (`cargo deny`, §7).
    - A dependency is acceptable only when rolling our own would be *less*
      safe or correct than a vetted, audited implementation. The sole standing
      example is cryptography: never hand-roll cryptographic primitives — use
      the audited crates wrapped behind `lib/crypto` (§6, §16.4). This
      exception does not generalise; "it's easier" is not a justification.
    - This rule never overrides §2.1 (no hacks), §2.5 (tests), or §2.6
      (senior-developer quality). Reinventing a wheel badly is worse than a
      well-chosen, audited dependency.
13. **No pre-release backwards-compatibility code. Evolve in place.**
    TAIRiX has **not shipped a release**, so nothing in this workspace has
    anything to be backwards-compatible *with*. There is no prior version,
    no installed base, and no foreign consumer of a TAIRiX-native interface.
    Therefore:
    - When an interface, type, on-disk format, or protocol is wrong or can
      be made better, **change it in place** and update every caller in the
      same change. Do not add a `v2` alongside a `v1`, a compatibility shim,
      a migration path, a fallback for "old" data, a feature flag that keeps
      the old behaviour, or a "deprecated but still works" alias. The single
      living definition is the only definition.
    - This is the freedom §9 grants while `abi-v1` is unfrozen: until the
      first release the ABI types are mutable, and the §2.4 "no interface
      creep" freeze binds **only from the first shipped release onward**.
      `abi-v2`, dual-version ABIs, and the immutability rule are *future*
      concerns; writing them now is forbidden bloat (§2.3).
    - This does **not** touch reading *foreign* systems' data. Reading an
      ext4 / FAT32 volume (§21) or speaking an existing network protocol
      created elsewhere is interoperability with the outside world, not
      TAIRiX self-compatibility, and is governed by its own sections. The
      ban is on carrying *our own* history we do not yet have.
    - If you believe a compatibility seam is genuinely required, you have
      found a design flaw — stop and ask (§15.7), do not paper over it.
14. **Delete obsolete code; leave nothing dead behind.** When a change makes
    code, a type, a file, a test fixture, a doc page, or a plan obsolete, the
    same change **deletes** it. Superseded code is never commented out, never
    renamed to `_old` / `legacy_` / `unused_`, never `#[allow(dead_code)]`-ed,
    and never "kept just in case". Dead code misleads a future reader (human
    or AI) into treating it as live, is an unaudited attack surface, and is a
    review blocker. Version control is the history; the tree holds only what
    is alive. Removing the last consumer of a `lib/*` crate, a driver, or a
    syscall means removing the thing itself and updating §3 / §16.4 / `PLAN.md`
    accordingly.
15. **No work is "done" until the validation gate is green.** Every piece of
    work — a feature, a bug fix, a refactor, a docs-only change, anything that
    touches the tree — MUST end by running the full validation pipeline over
    the **entire** workspace and seeing it pass before it is reported,
    submitted, merged, or marked complete. This is not optional and has no
    "trivial change" exemption. It has exactly **one** exemption, stated below
    and nowhere else: a change confined to the planning and charter documents
    (`plans/*.md`, `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`), which no pipeline
    stage can observe.
    - The gate is the §7 "Definition of done" sequence, run from the
      repository root and never scoped to a single crate with `-p`:
      `cargo fmt --all` (verified with `cargo fmt --all --check`), the full
      `cargo xtask ci` pull-request pipeline, the `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5`
      run, and anything else `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exercises (§7, §15.6).
    - "Done" means a **green** gate. A change that compiles, or whose touched
      crate alone tests clean, is **not** done. The actual command output is
      quoted in the completion report (§7, §23.4).
    - Any failure the gate surfaces — in code you touched or anywhere else —
      is fixed or reverted in the same change before the work is done.
      "Pre-existing" and "out of scope" are not exits (§2.5, §7).
    - Skipping, deferring ("CI will catch it"), faking, or partially running
      the gate is a §2.1 hack and a review blocker (§15.3, §15.6).
    - **The one exemption: a change confined to the planning and charter
      documents no pipeline stage can observe** — `plans/*.md`, `PLAN.md`,
      `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. When *every* path the change adds,
      modifies, or deletes is one of those, the gate is **not** run: there is
      nothing for it to observe. `charter-cite` scans only
      `.rs`/`.s`/`.toml`/`.sh`/`.yml`/`.yaml`, `spec-review` only `.rs`,
      `help-lint` only the `userland/` bundles, and `docs-check` (rustdoc,
      mdBook, the link and stale-symbol checks) only `docs/` — and nothing in
      the workspace compiles, includes, or tests a plan or this charter. A
      fifteen-minute run that cannot see the change proves nothing, so
      starting one is waste, not diligence.
      - **One path outside that set and the full gate applies to the whole
        change.** `README.md`, `docs/`, `include/`, and every source tree are
        outside it.
      - **The one charter edit that is *not* exempt: changing the section-label
        set.** `charter-cite` derives the labels it recognises (`2.11`,
        `19.10`, …) from this file, so *adding, removing, or renumbering a
        numbered section* changes which `§N` in a source comment the check
        flags — it can turn an unchanged source file from passing to failing
        or back. Run the gate for that. Editing prose *within* an existing
        section leaves the label set identical and stays exempt.
      - **Everything else still binds.** The §13 content rules for plan
        files (state the plan, not a changelog; no waffle), the §15.18
        jump-sheet obligation for a new or deleted plan, the §23
        adversarial self-review, and the §23.5 completion report are
        unaffected: the exemption is about running a pipeline, not about
        care.
16. **Performance is a first-class goal, never an afterthought.** A correct,
    secure result that is needlessly slow is not finished work; choosing the
    efficient design when a clean one exists is part of the §2.6 bar.
    - **Order of precedence.** Security (§2.7), correctness (§2.5, §2.6), and
      the safety rules (§2.1, §2.9, §2.10) come first; performance is next,
      ahead of convenience. It never licenses a hack (§2.1), a weakened or
      skipped test (§2.5), an unchecked input or ambient-authority shortcut
      (§5.4), an `unsafe` block without its §2.10 obligations, or a `panic!` on
      an error path (§2.9). On a genuine, *measured* security-vs-speed conflict,
      security wins and the cost is documented.
    - **Hot paths are designed, not discovered.** Syscall/IPC dispatch (§9),
      the capability check (§5.4), scheduler pick/yield/wake (§17.1), context
      switch and TLB handling (§17.2), the allocator (§4), interrupt
      entry/exit, the compositor blit/blend path (§10), and the filesystem and
      network data paths are efficient by construction — no needless
      allocation, copying, locking, or per-call work that can be hoisted,
      precomputed, or amortised. Their mandatory security checks (§5.4) must
      themselves be efficient, not skipped.
    - **No premature pessimisation, no blind micro-optimisation.** Do not write
      gratuitously wasteful code (redundant copies, O(n²) where O(n) is as
      clear, over-long locks, allocation in a tight loop), nor contort code or
      reach for `unsafe` for speculative speed without a measurement (§2.11).
    - **Measure, do not guess (§15.7).** Performance claims and regressions are
      evidence-backed (benchmark, complexity argument, or profile). A change
      that blows a stated latency/throughput budget is a defect, fixed or
      reverted in the same change like a failed test (§2.5).
    - **Scope discipline still applies.** Not a licence for bloat (§2.3),
      speculative interfaces (§2.4), or sibling-collapsing "fast paths" that
      duplicate logic (§2.2).
17. **Never defer, weaken, or trade away a security defence. Fix it now.**
    A known security weakness — a missing guard page, an absent bounds or
    capability check, an unchecked input, a fail-open path, a use-after-free, a
    missing zeroisation of secrets, an `unsafe` invariant without its proof —
    is fixed **in the change that discovers or touches it**, never parked behind
    a `TODO`, "future work", a follow-up issue, or a "good enough for now".
    - **No security regressions, ever.** Never remove, bypass, loosen, or
      "temporarily" disable a guard page, canary, capability gate, validation,
      sandbox, encryption, or any other defence to make code compile, a test
      pass, a deadline, or a diff smaller — that is the §2.1 hack.
    - **Bumping a limit is not a fix.** Enlarging a buffer, stack, timeout, or
      quota so a problem "stops happening" is mitigation, not the structural
      control (e.g. a guard page that turns the overrun into a deterministic
      fault, or a fail-closed check). If that control is genuinely large, still
      land a real, *non-deferred* defence now (§4, §19.10, a fail-closed check)
      and **stage** the deployment form in `PLAN.md`/`plans/`.
    - **"Later", "out of scope", and "pre-existing" are not exits.** A security
      defect you notice you own: fix it in the same change or, if genuinely too
      large, stop and ask (§15.7) — never quietly leave it.
    - This never overrides §2.5 or §2.6; it reinforces §2.7 and §5.4. Deferring
      or reducing a security defence is a review blocker (§23.1).
18. **Every defect you cause or notice is fixed now, not deferred.** §2.17 is
    this for *security*; this rule makes it absolute for **every** defect — a
    wrong result, crash, leak, race, broken build, failing or flaky test, lint,
    regression, stale doc, layering or ABI violation, anything. Two channels
    both oblige you to act:
    - **(1) The validation gate surfaces it** — any failure the §7 / §2.15
      whole-project gate produces (failed test, clippy/fmt error, fuzz/proptest
      crash, deps/cfg/abi/docs-check failure, coverage miss) is fixed or
      reverted **in the same change**, in code you touched or anywhere else.
    - **(2) You notice it by reading or reasoning about the code**, even with a
      green gate and no test flagging it. You fix it in the same change too.
    - This holds whether the defect was *introduced*, *revealed*, or merely
      *spotted in passing*: "unrelated", "pre-existing", "out of scope", "not my
      change", "the gate didn't catch it", and "later" are **not** exits.
    - **The only escape is to stop and ask (§15.7), never to stay silent.** If a
      noticed defect is genuinely too large for the current change, raise it
      explicitly — surface it and record it in `PLAN.md`/`plans/` — before
      proceeding. Burying it in a `// TODO` or omitting it from the completion
      report is the §2.1 hack this rule forbids.
    - **Every fixed defect carries a regression test, always (§7, §23.4)** —
      one that fails before the fix and passes after (a fuzzer/proptest find
      also enters the corpus, §19.6); no path fixes a defect without landing its
      test in the same change. An escalated defect (§15.7) carries the test
      requirement until the fix lands, so no bug is ever closed untested.
    - This never overrides §2.5 or §2.6; a change that ships a known defect of
      any kind is a review blocker (§23).
19. **No "for now". Do the work properly, or surface the conflict — never
    defer.** Never ship a lesser solution justified as temporary: "for now",
    "good enough for now", "works for now", "fine for the moment",
    "placeholder until …", "stub until …", "wire it up properly later", or any
    phrasing that knowingly does a thing *wrong* or *partially* while deferring
    the correct work. The word "now" in this rule is literal: the proper
    solution lands **in this change**, not in a promised follow-up. This
    generalises §2.1's ban on `// works for now` and is the positive form of
    §2.17/§2.18: deferring *correctness* is the same defect as deferring a
    security fix or any other defect.
    - **If the proper solution depends on other work that is not yet done,
      that dependency is part of this change — do it.** You do not get to stub,
      fake, or "for now" your way past a missing prerequisite. Either complete
      the prerequisite and then build correctly on top of it, or, if the
      prerequisite is genuinely too large for this change, **stop and ask**
      (§15.7) — never silently substitute a temporary hack.
    - **If completing that dependency conflicts with something else** — another
      rule in this charter, an in-flight design, an explicit requirement you
      cannot reconcile, or two requirements that contradict — you MUST **stop
      and inform the User so they can decide** (§15.7). You may not resolve the
      conflict yourself by picking a "for now" compromise, weakening one side,
      or guessing which requirement wins.
    - "Temporary", "interim", and "we'll revisit" are not exits. There is no
      "for now" tier of quality below the §2.6 senior-developer bar; work is
      either correct or it is not done.
20. **Generic, multi-architecture, and shared code is platform-neutral —
    absolutely no board or SoC coupling.** Any code that is meant to work
    across architectures or to be shared — every `lib/*` crate that is not a
    single device's support code, every architecture-neutral `kernel/*`
    subsystem (i.e. everything under `kernel/` except `kernel/arch/<target>/`),
    the driver host and every core driver *framework*, the syscall/IPC/ABI
    surface, and all of `userland/*` — MUST be generic. It MUST NOT contain a
    reference, name, comment, constant, magic address, register layout, quirk,
    or `cfg` tied to a specific platform, board, or SoC (for example Raspberry
    Pi 3/4/5, BCM2711/BCM2837/BCM2712, a specific UART/GIC/timer base, or a
    specific vendor part). A driver *core framework* that mentions a board is a
    defect that "should simply not exist" — even if it compiles and tests pass.
    - **Platform specifics have exactly one home: `kernel/arch/<target>/`**
      (plus the §1 boot-stub / linker-script / load-address carve-out, fixed
      before any tree is parsed). Every other layer learns about the hardware
      *at runtime*, by discovery — the §18.1 hardware tree normalised from the
      device tree (`lib/fdt`) / ACPI / host query — never from a compile-time
      board constant or a `cfg(board = …)` / `cfg(target_arch = …)` fork
      outside the §17.2 allow-list. MMIO bases, IRQ lines, and DMA constraints
      are *discovered values threaded from the tree*, not literals baked into a
      shared or kernel-neutral crate.
    - **A driver binds to hardware through discovery, never by naming a
      board.** A concrete driver matches its device via the manifest bind-table
      match keys (§18.3) and receives only the resource capabilities its
      matched node requests (§4, §18.1). The generic framework *above* the
      driver stays platform-neutral and never special-cases a board.
    - **Carve-out — a device's own driver/support crate may know its device.**
      A crate (or driver-crate `lib` target) whose entire purpose is one piece
      of hardware (e.g. the `drivers/bus/pcie_brcm` / `drivers/bus/usb/vl805`
      driver crates, `drivers/display/rpi_hvs`, `lib/vcmailbox`) legitimately
      targets that hardware; that is its job. But it is *reached only through
      the discovery/match path* (§18.3) and never leaks its board into a
      shared, generic, or arch-neutral path — and the device logic lives in
      that device's own driver crate (or, only when a charter-legal non-driver
      consumer shares it, a `lib/*` device-support crate, §2.22), never inside
      a core framework.
    - This makes §17.2 / §17.4 absolute for generated code: platform
      neutrality is not "preferred", it is mandatory. If a clean generic
      solution seems impossible without naming a platform, the HAL (§17.2) is
      incomplete — extend it under `kernel/arch/api/` and stop and ask (§15.7);
      do not work around it in shared or kernel-neutral code.
21. **Architecture-specific code is a last resort, and shared code is found by
    looking across *all* architectures.** §2.20 forbids tying generic code to a
    board; this rule binds the amount of arch-specific code that may exist at
    all and forbids leaving common logic stranded in one architecture's files.
    - **Write the minimum arch-specific code the silicon strictly requires,
      and no more.** A line belongs under `kernel/arch/<target>/` (or the §1
      assembly carve-out) **only** when it expresses something the hardware
      genuinely makes target-specific — a register layout, a privileged
      instruction, an MMU/TLB/context-switch primitive, an errata mitigation
      (§19.1/§19.10), a boot/discovery source (§18.2). Anything that *can* be
      expressed once over the Arch HAL (§17.2) and `lib/*` MUST be, even if it
      is momentarily convenient to inline it per target. "It was easier to copy
      into each arch" is the §2.2 duplication this charter forbids.
    - **Single-architecture work still considers every architecture.** Before
      adding or changing code under one `kernel/arch/<target>/` (or any
      single-target path), you MUST check whether the same logic does, or will,
      exist for the other Tier-1 targets. If the logic is — or by its nature
      will be — identical across targets, it is **not** arch-specific: hoist it
      into a shared home (a `lib/*` crate, an arch-neutral `kernel/*`
      subsystem, or a default method / helper in `kernel/arch/api/`) and have
      every target depend on the one definition. Only the genuinely
      target-divergent remainder stays in the per-target crate. Landing a fix
      or feature in one arch's file while knowingly leaving its identical twin
      to be re-derived in a sibling arch later is a §2.2 / §2.19 defect, not a
      smaller diff.
    - **The test of "is this really arch-specific?".** If two architectures'
      versions of a thing would differ only by values that are *discovered* at
      runtime (§18.1) — an MMIO base, an IRQ number, a hart/CPU count — then the
      thing is generic and the values are data threaded from discovery; the code
      goes in the shared home, not duplicated per arch. It is genuinely
      arch-specific only when the *code itself* (instructions, layout, ordering
      the ISA dictates) differs, not merely the data it operates on.
    - **When the shared home is missing, create or extend it — do not duplicate
      (§15.7).** If common logic has nowhere arch-neutral to live, the Arch HAL
      (§17.2) or a `lib/*` crate is incomplete: extend `kernel/arch/api/` or add
      the `lib/*` crate (§6, updating §3 and `PLAN.md`) so the one definition is
      shared. If that is genuinely too large for the current change, stop and
      ask (§15.7); never settle for a per-arch copy "for now" (§2.19).
22. **Device-driver logic lives in `drivers/<class>/<leaf>/`, not in `lib/*`.**
    A device's bring-up/firmware/quirk/register logic belongs in its own driver
    crate. A `lib/*` device-support crate (the §2.20 single-device carve-out)
    is permitted **only** when a non-driver consumer that is itself
    charter-legal shares it — a `kernel/arch/<target>/` bootstrap-floor path
    justified per §18.6, or a driver of a *different* class. "A transitional
    in-kernel scaffold also links it" is **not** a valid second consumer: that
    scaffold is the §18.5 defect to be removed, not a justification for
    hoisting device logic into `lib/*`. A `lib/*` device-support crate that
    loses its last charter-legal non-driver consumer is **collapsed into its
    single `drivers/*` consumer** (§2.2, §2.14) — co-located as a host-testable
    `lib` target the driver's `Run` binary links, so the device logic and its
    `register`/`BIND_KEYS`/wiring live in one place with no second crate to
    keep in sync. This binds the §2.20 carve-out / §17.4 layering interaction:
    when device logic would have *both* a `drivers/*` consumer and an
    illegitimate kernel-scaffold consumer, the fix is to remove the scaffold
    (§18.5), not to keep the logic in `lib/*`. (`lib/vcmailbox` stays in
    `lib/*` legitimately: its non-driver consumer is the aarch64 framebuffer
    boot console, a genuine early-boot need, not a removable scaffold.)
23. **No busy-waiting or inefficient polling where an event-driven path
    exists. Block, park, or wait on the event — never spin.** A task, driver,
    or service that has nothing to do until some event occurs (a device
    completes a transfer, input arrives, a reply lands, a lock frees, a
    deadline elapses) MUST give the CPU up and be woken by that event — park
    on the scheduler (`reschedule_current(Park)` / a `WaitQueue`), wait on the
    device interrupt (`irq_bind`/`irq_wait`), block on the IPC/console/wait
    backing, or arm a one-shot timer — never sit in a tight `loop { poll();
    yield_now() }` (or `loop { poll() }`) that re-runs continuously and pegs a
    core at 100%. This is the same defect §2.1 names (a "sleep loop,
    retry-until-it-works") and §17.1's "no cooperative dispatch loop", applied
    to **every** layer — kernel, drivers, and userland alike, not just the
    kernel dispatch loop.
    - **Continuous busy-poll is a defect, not a configuration.** A
      perpetually-runnable yield loop wastes power, starves nothing only by
      luck of the scheduler, and is exactly the cooperative anti-pattern the
      charter forbids. A user-space driver waiting for its device's next event
      parks on that device's interrupt (the capability-gated `irq_bind`/
      `irq_wait` pair, §3 `kernel/irq`); it does not spin.
    - **A periodic re-poll is the fallback, not the default, and is tickless.**
      Where an event genuinely has no interrupt/wake source (a device that can
      only be polled), wait the hardware-dictated interval on a one-shot timer
      (so the CPU sleeps between polls and the kernel stays tickless, §17.1) —
      never a tight spin. Prefer the event-driven path; justify any polling
      fallback in the crate's docs.
    - **The narrow, documented exceptions** are the genuinely unavoidable
      bounded spins the silicon dictates: a hardware-handshake poll with a
      bounded budget that fails closed (e.g. a controller-reset or
      MMIO-readiness wait, `tx_wait`), and a low-level lock's acquire spin
      (`lib/sync`), both of which spin only briefly and never as a task's
      steady state. Reaching for one of these to avoid wiring the event-driven
      path is the defect this rule forbids.
    - If the event-driven path does not yet exist (an interrupt is not wired
      through discovery, a wake source is missing), that wiring is part of the
      change; if it is genuinely too large, stop and ask (§15.7) and stage it
      (§2.18/§2.19) — never ship the busy-poll "for now".
24. **Fail loud, degrade gracefully.** A program never ends abnormally in
    silence, and never dies over a refused *optional* action.
    - **Every abnormal exit states its reason.** A process that ends for any
      reason other than clean completion or the user's own request writes a
      concise, human-readable reason to `stderr` (§20) before exiting — from
      the failing program itself when it can still fail gracefully, or from
      the component that observed the failure (the spawner/shell reporting a
      load refusal or a fatal signal) when it cannot. An exit code alone is
      not a diagnosis; a silent non-zero exit is a defect. Where no
      terminal/stderr consumer can show the reason to a user (a daemon, a
      detached session), the observing component records the termination
      through the system log (`lib/log`) instead — the reason must land
      somewhere a user can find it, best-effort on both channels. The message
      never carries secrets or capability tokens (§23.1) and never
      substitutes for the §19.4 audit log on a security decision.
    - **A denied optional action is an answer, not a fatal error.** When a
      capability-gated or otherwise refusable action that is *incidental* to
      a program's primary purpose is refused (`top`'s system-wide toggle for
      want of `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`, an optional query, a settable option the
      holder may not set), the program reports the refusal — in its own UI
      for an interactive session, on `stderr` otherwise — and continues with
      the authority it has. It neither terminates over it nor fabricates or
      partially applies the refused result: the *action* still fails closed
      (§5.4); only the *session* survives. A failure that defeats the
      program's primary purpose is genuinely fatal and ends it with its
      reason stated as above.

## 3. Repository Layout (authoritative)

This is a directory *map* only: where files live, not what they do internally.
Each entry gets a one-line "what it is" label — never a design spec. A crate's
design, rationale, invariants, and cross-references live in its own
`README.md` / rustdoc and its `docs/src/` page; the topic → plan jump-sheet
is §15.18. (That is the one and only cross-reference this section carries;
keep it that way.)

## 4. Kernel Rules

- **Microkernel-leaning.** Drivers run in user space wherever feasible. Only
  scheduling, memory, IPC, capabilities, and the minimum architecture glue
  live in ring 0 / EL1 / M-mode.
- **SMP from day one.** No "single-CPU first, parallelize later" patches.
  All shared state uses explicit synchronization primitives from `lib/sync`.
- **Memory isolation is enforced by hardware** (page tables / MMU / WASM
  sandboxing). A process can only reach another process's memory through an
  explicit, capability-checked shared-memory IPC object.
- **Allocator requirements:**
  - Per-process heaps, never a global user heap.
  - Guard pages around kernel slabs.
  - Zero-on-free for any allocation that ever held credentials, keys, or
    capability tokens.
  - No `unsafe` global allocator that performs raw pointer arithmetic without
    bounds-checked wrappers.
  - Deterministic OOM behaviour: allocation failure is a `Result`, never a panic.
- **Encrypted swap is the default; there is no plaintext-swap mode.** Any
  backing store the kernel pages anonymous, stack, or capability-bearing memory
  out to is encrypted with `lib/crypto` — swap inherits the same secret bar as
  RAM (the zero-on-free guarantee is void otherwise).
  - The swap key is an ephemeral per-boot random key from the platform RNG (the
    §19.2 entropy source), **never persisted** and discarded on shutdown, so
    paged-out secrets are unrecoverable at rest.
  - The kernel refuses to activate a swap device not wrapped by the
    encrypted-swap layer and fails closed (§5.4) rather than falling back to
    plaintext; the installer never lays out plaintext swap (§11).
- **No ambient authority.** Every syscall takes the calling task's capability
  set explicitly; there is no "root can do anything" backdoor in kernel code.

---

## 5. Security Model

### 5.1 Users and Groups

- Every process runs as `(uid, gid, supplementary_gids, capability_set)`.
- `uid = 0` is **not** all-powerful. It is merely the system user; powers come
  from capabilities, not from the uid.
- Groups are first-class objects with their own ACL.
- Users and groups are persisted in `/System/Security/Users` and
  `/System/Security/Groups` (see §16 for the on-disk filesystem layout).
  Both are themselves protected by capabilities.
- There is no `/etc`. Anything that on a POSIX system would live under
  `/etc` lives under `/System/Settings/` (machine-wide) or under the
  per-user `/Users/<name>/Settings/` (user-scoped). See §16.

### 5.2 Capabilities

- Capabilities are unforgeable kernel-issued tokens. Examples:
  `CAP_FS_MOUNT`, `CAP_NET_RAW`, `CAP_DRV_LOAD`, `CAP_USER_ADMIN`,
  `CAP_TIME_SET`, `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`, `CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN`. The
  authoritative set is `lib/abi/src/capability.rs`, not this list.
- A process's capability set is the intersection of its user's grants and its
  executable's manifest request. Manifests are signed.
- Capabilities can be **delegated** (a subset, never a superset) and **revoked**.
- IPC endpoints declare the capabilities required to call each method. The
  kernel enforces this at dispatch time; the receiver does not need to re-check.
- **The capability set is deliberately small, and stays small. A new
  capability is a last resort, not a convenience.** Every `CAP_*` widens the
  vocabulary every reviewer, manifest author, and audit must reason about, so
  the set must survive the scrutiny of a senior kernel reviewer (§2.6). Before
  adding one, all of the following must hold; if any fails, do **not** add it —
  use the existing controls (the per-inode owner/mode/ACL/`required_cap` model
  §5.3, mount flags §5.3, an existing coarse capability, or the identity of the
  calling principal) or stop and ask (§15.7):
  1. **It guards a real security boundary for a *group* of resources** — a
     whole class of operations or objects (all raw network access, all driver
     loading, the entire audit log) — never a single file, path, device
     instance, or method. "Gate this one thing" is the per-inode/`required_cap`
     model's job, not a new capability's.
  2. **It has a live holder and a live enforcement point in the *same* change.**
     A capability defined "for later", before any principal is granted it or
     any entry point checks it, is speculative interface (§2.3, §2.4) and is
     forbidden — it is added with the subsystem that enforces it, not ahead of
     it.
  3. **No existing capability already expresses the authority** at an
     appropriate granularity. Splitting one coarse capability into finer ones
     is justified only by a demonstrated need to grant one without the other;
     absent that, the coarse capability stands.
  Renaming, merging, or deleting a capability is in-place evolution like any
  other pre-release change (§2.13) — the set is curated, not append-only.

### 5.3 Filesystem permissions

- POSIX mode bits **plus** ACLs **plus** capability gates.
- Every inode stores: owner uid, owning gid, mode, ACL, and an optional
  capability requirement (e.g. "reading this file requires `CAP_AUDIT_READ`").
- **A capability gate guards the inode's *name* as well as its content.**
  Adding, removing, and renaming a directory's entries is authorised against
  the holding *directory*, so without this a principal who may write that
  directory could unlink or rename a gated node aside and plant an ungated
  replacement — defeating the gate without ever opening it. `unlink`,
  `rmdir`, and `rename` (at either end, since replacing a name destroys its
  occupant) therefore demand the gate's capability, exactly as a mode or
  ownership change on the node already does.
- Mounts have their own permission policy (`nosuid`, `nodev`, `noexec`,
  `ro`, etc.) and the installer's default layout uses them aggressively.
  The concrete defaults for `/System`, `/Users`, `/Apps`, and `/Storage`
  are defined in §16.

### 5.4 Mandatory rules for every IPC/syscall/driver entry point

1. Identify the caller (kernel-provided, not caller-supplied).
2. Check capabilities **before** touching any state.
3. Validate **every** input. No "trusted caller" shortcuts.
4. Log security-relevant decisions through `lib/log` with a stable event ID.
5. Fail closed.

---

## 6. Code Re-use and Common Libraries

- All shared code lives in `lib/`. If two crates need it, it goes there.
- A `lib/*` crate must:
  - be `no_std` unless explicitly justified,
  - have its own unit tests,
  - have rustdoc on every public item,
  - declare a stability tier in its `README.md` (`experimental`, `stable`, `frozen`).
- Adding a `lib/*` crate requires updating §3 and `PLAN.md`.

---

## 7. Testing Rules

- **Mirror layout.** Unit tests live next to the code they test:
  - `kernel/mem/src/allocator.rs` → tests in the same file under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
    *or* in `kernel/mem/src/allocator_tests.rs` if the file would otherwise exceed
    500 lines.
  - Integration tests for a crate live in `<crate>/tests/`.
  - Cross-crate / end-to-end tests live in the top-level `tests/`.
- **Every change runs the full test matrix.** `cargo xtask test` runs:
  1. `cargo test` for all host-testable crates.
  2. `cargo test --target <each kernel target>` where applicable (using QEMU
     via `tools/qemu`).
  3. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (warnings are errors).
  4. `cargo fmt --check`.
  5. `cargo deny check` (license + advisory audit).
  6. `cargo doc --no-deps` (doc build must succeed; broken links fail the build).
- **Definition of done — the whole project, not just the touched crate.**
  A change is not "done" until the **entire** workspace test suite has been
  run and is green. This is non-negotiable, subject to the single §2.15
  exemption (a change confined to `plans/*.md`, `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or
  `CLAUDE.md`, which no stage below can observe). Before reporting any task complete you MUST run, over the whole
  project (never scoped to a single crate with `-p`):
  1. `cargo fmt --all` (and verify with `cargo fmt --all --check`).
  2. `cargo xtask ci` — the full pull-request pipeline (clippy, deps-check,
     cfg-check, the test matrix, docs-check, `cargo deny`, supply-chain,
     the per-PR `--quick` fuzz and proptest gates, the `miri` and `loom`
     oracles over their enrolled sets (§19.11), model-check, spec-review,
     crypto constant-time, and abi-check). Run this **exactly once**: the
     pipeline is internally idempotent and runs each check a single time, so a
     second consecutive `cargo xtask ci` is pure waste and is forbidden.
  3. A fuzzing run of **at least 5 seconds** per harness:
     `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5` (this is on top of the `--quick` gate that
     `cargo xtask ci` already runs).
  4. Anything `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs **beyond `cargo xtask ci`
     itself** that steps 1–3 above do not already cover — i.e. the parallel
     soak via `tools/ci/soak.sh`. `ci.yml`'s own `cargo xtask ci` step is
     already covered by step 2 and is **never** re-run: "run what CI runs"
     means the extra soak step, not a second `cargo xtask ci`. A locally green
     run and a green CI run are equivalent by construction.
     - **`tools/ci/soak.sh` on a developer machine (that's us) runs for a
       maximum of 20 seconds.** Run it as `tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20`
       (or another kind with `--secs 20`): a developer-machine soak is a
       smoke check, never the full nightly budget. The unbounded 24 h soak
       (`--soak` / no `--secs`) is for the dedicated CI/soak host only and
       must never be launched on a developer machine. The 20-second cap is
       a ceiling, not a target — a shorter run is fine, a longer one is not.
  Quote the actual command output when reporting completion. A per-crate
  (`-p <crate>`) run is never a substitute for the whole-project run.
- **Watch the gate to completion and report only its real exit status.** The
  `cargo xtask ci`, `cargo xtask fuzz`, and `tools/ci/soak.sh` runs (and any
  other validation-gate command) MUST run to completion against the tree you
  are reporting on, and the status you report MUST be the one that run actually
  produced. Reporting from a partial, stale, still-running, or killed gate is
  the §2.1 hack this rule forbids, however the run was launched.
  - **The default is the foreground: launch it, wait, then report.** Do not
    background or detach a gate you could simply have waited for, and never
    poll a log file in place of waiting for the process.
  - **The one exception is a caller that cannot wait that long.** `ci` takes
    longer than an agent harness allows a single tool call (see
    `docs/src/contributing.md` for the measured budget), and a foreground call
    killed at that cap writes *no* exit status — strictly worse than useless.
    There, and only there, run it so the process is tracked to exit and its
    status is captured durably, and read the status back from that record:
    `{ cargo xtask ci > ci.log 2>&1; echo "CI-RC=$?" >> ci.log; }`. The
    appended code is written only after the process exits, so it is the real
    one; a wrapper's or a shell's exit code may be the `echo`'s.
  - **What the exception does not license.** Do no other work while the gate
    runs, and finish every source and documentation edit *before* launching it
    — a result that does not describe the tree you report on is worthless, so
    an edit that becomes necessary mid-run means stopping the run. Confirm the
    run reached the end of the pipeline (its final stage, and matching enrolled
    and completed test counts) rather than judging by elapsed time.
  - **Arm exactly one waiter, then stop looking.** Waiting on a backgrounded
    gate means one mechanism that reports its completion — a watcher on the
    exit-code line, or the harness's own notification for the launched
    process — and then nothing until it fires. Re-reading the log to see how
    far it has got is waste, not diligence: each check costs a round trip and
    tells you nothing the completion signal will not, and doing it *alongside*
    a waiter you already armed is pure duplication. One check to confirm the
    run started is enough; after that the next thing you do is read the
    recorded exit code. A ladder of short sleeps, or a loop of "is it done
    yet" probes, is the polling this rule forbids — and it burns the limited
    context the rest of the work needs.
  - **The waiter is a monitor, and nothing else is a waiter.** Waiting means
    one blocking watcher that fires when the run ends — a `Monitor` on the
    exit-code line, or the harness's completion notification. A `sleep` in a
    tool call is **not** waiting: it is a poll with a timer in front of it,
    and it is forbidden however it is dressed up — a bare `sleep`, a
    `sleep`-then-`tail`, an "idle" echo issued to pass the time, or a run of
    short no-op calls while a monitor is already armed. Between arming the
    waiter and its firing you issue **no** tool calls about that run at all.
    If you catch yourself wondering how far it has got, that is the rule
    working; the answer arrives on its own.
  - **Arm the waiter only against a log the run itself has already written
    to.** A watcher started while the launch chain is still in `cargo clean`
    or has not yet truncated the log can match a *previous* run's exit-code
    line and fire in seconds — reporting a status that describes a different
    tree, which is precisely the hack this section forbids. Confirm the log
    holds no exit-code line (`grep -c 'CI-RC=' …` is `0`) and that the run is
    genuinely under way, and only then arm.
  - The completion report quotes the output of a run watched to its end.
  `tools/ci/soak.sh` is additionally capped on a developer machine (that's
  us) to a **maximum of 20 seconds** (`tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20`); the
  unbounded 24 h soak is for the CI/soak host only, never a developer machine.
- **Every issue found is fixed, not deferred.** If any of the runs above
  fails — in code you touched or anywhere else — you MUST fix it (or revert
  the change that caused it) before the task is done. "Pre-existing
  failure" and "unrelated crate" are not exemptions (see §2.5, §2.18).
  This is not limited to failures the gate *prints*: a defect you notice by
  reading or reasoning about the code — even with a green gate and no test
  flagging it — is owned and fixed in the same change too, or, if genuinely
  too large, raised explicitly under §15.7 before proceeding (§2.18). Burying
  it, ignoring it because "the tests pass", or leaving it out of the
  completion report is forbidden.
- **A failing test blocks the change.** Whether or not the failure existed
  before is irrelevant.
- **Tests are never deferred.** Writing the tests for a change is part of
  that change, not "future work". You may not merge code with the tests
  stubbed, postponed, marked `#[ignore]`, or tracked as a "tests to be
  added later" follow-up. A change whose tests are not written and passing
  is incomplete and must not be reported as done.
- **Every bug found gets a regression test, always.** Whenever a defect is
  fixed — whether the validation gate surfaced it or it was noticed by reading
  or reasoning about the code (§2.18) — the fix lands with a test that fails
  before and passes after (§23.4); a fuzzer/proptest find also enters the
  regression corpus (§19.6). This applies to *every* bug the change closes,
  not only the one the task was about. If a noticed defect is genuinely too
  large to fix now and is escalated (§15.7), the regression test is part of
  that escalated work and is written when the fix lands — a bug is never
  closed without its test.
- **No flaky tests, and "transient" is not a diagnosis.** A test that fails
  intermittently is a bug; fix the test or fix the code, never retry. You may
  **not** reclassify such a failure as "transient", a "load flake", a "timeout
  under parallel load", an "environment blip", or any other label that excuses
  it from the defect-fixing obligation (§2.5, §2.18) — naming a failure to
  avoid fixing it is itself the §2.1 hack. A green re-run is **not** a fix and
  is never evidence the defect is gone: it proves only that the failure is
  intermittent, which is precisely the bug. In particular, a wall-clock timeout
  that is reachable when a test runs alone but missed under parallel load is a
  **load-dependent (i.e. flaky) timeout** — fix it structurally (a budget sized
  to the actual work, bounded concurrency so guests do not oversubscribe the
  host, or a completion signal), never by retrying and never by declaring the
  miss transient. If a failure's cause is genuinely not yet understood, that is
  an open defect to investigate and fix (or escalate, §15.7) — not a
  "transient" to wave through, and not something a completion report may
  describe as resolved.
  - **"Machine load" is never an excuse — and never has been.** The single
    most abused get-out is "the test only failed because the machine was
    busy, so I re-ran it alone and it passed". This is **forbidden**, in every
    phrasing: "it was flaky because of machine load", "CPU contention", "the
    host was oversubscribed", "it passes when run on its own", "it was just
    the CI runner being slow". Re-running a failed test in isolation to make it
    "pass" is **not** an investigation, **not** a fix, and **not** an
    acceptable resolution — it is the exact hack this rule exists to stop.
    Every single time a failure in this project has been dismissed as "machine
    load", it has turned out to be a **genuine defect** that machine load
    merely *exposed* — a real race, an unsynchronised wait, an unbounded queue,
    a budget sized to an idle host, a missing completion signal. Load is a
    **test amplifier that surfaces real bugs**, not a cause of false failures.
    Treat a failure that appears under load as a confirmed defect and find the
    real cause; the load only did you the favour of revealing it.
  - **What you MUST do when a test fails, ever, for any reason.** Diagnose the
    *why* until the mechanism is understood, then fix the code or the test so
    the failure cannot recur under any load, and land a regression test that
    demonstrates the fix (§7 "Every bug found gets a regression test"). You may
    **not** close, submit, or report the work while any test has failed even
    once in the current work — "it went green on retry" is not "fixed". If the
    real fix is genuinely too large for the current change, stop and ask
    (§15.7) and stage it; never wave the failure through as load, transient, or
    environment.
- **Coverage targets** (enforced by `cargo xtask coverage`):
  - `kernel/sec`, `kernel/mem`, `kernel/ipc`, `lib/caps`, `lib/crypto`: **≥ 95%**
  - All other kernel crates: ≥ 85%
  - Drivers and userland: ≥ 75%

---

## 8. Drivers

- A driver is a crate under `drivers/<class>/<name>/`.
- **The driver *path namespace* names a device class or bus type — never a
  vendor or product.** Every directory level above the leaf — the source
  `drivers/<class>/[<subclass>/]` path (§3) and the installed
  `/System/Drivers/<class>[_<subtype>]/` path (§16.2) — is named only by what
  the device *is* (`bus`, `bus/usb`, `display`, `input`, `storage`, `network`,
  …), so a vendor-neutral consumer can find every driver of a class without
  knowing who made the part. A vendor or product name (`broadcom`, `brcm`,
  `rpi`, `intel`, …) as a path-namespace segment is a defect — e.g.
  `/System/Drivers/broadcom_usb/...` is wrong; `/System/Drivers/bus_usb/...`
  is right.
- **A vendor or chip name is permitted *only* as the leaf directory** of a
  driver whose entire purpose is that one specific part — the driver's own
  crate/bundle directory, which holds the driver file(s) inside it (e.g. the
  source crate `drivers/bus/usb/vl805/`, `drivers/display/rpi_hvs/`, and the
  installed `/System/Drivers/bus_usb/broadcom_chip_1234/<driver>`). The
  vendor/chip name is the *directory* that contains the driver module, never a
  segment of the class/bus namespace above it. The leaf names the concrete
  hardware it binds to (§18.3); the namespace above it stays vendor-neutral.
  This is the §2.20 carve-out for a device's own driver crate, applied to
  naming: knowing the part at the leaf is the driver's job, leaking the vendor
  into the shared path space is not.
- It implements the trait(s) defined in `lib/abi/src/driver/<class>.rs`.
- It exposes a single `pub fn register(host: &dyn DriverHost) -> Result<DriverHandle, DriverError>`
  entry point. Nothing else is public.
- Drivers are **loadable and unloadable at runtime** unless the hardware
  forbids it (document why in the crate's `README.md`).
- Drivers run in user space by default. A driver that must run in-kernel
  declares `kind = "in-kernel"` in its manifest and requires `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`
  at load time.
- Every driver has:
  - `README.md` describing supported hardware, limitations, and required capabilities.
  - Unit tests against a mock bus/host.
  - At least one QEMU integration test where the hardware is emulable.

---

## 9. Executable ABI

- One binary format: **`rxe`** (Rust eXecutable Envelope) — an ELF-derived
  format extended with a signed manifest section describing:
  - Required capabilities.
  - Target ABI version (`abi-vN`).
  - Linked syscall interface hashes (refuse to load on mismatch).
- The ABI is versioned. `abi-v1` becomes immutable **once shipped**; new
  behaviour then ships as `abi-v2`. **TAIRiX has not shipped a release, so
  `abi-v1` is not frozen yet** — it is still mutable, and changing a `lib/abi`
  type today is allowed (it merely requires regenerating the generated views
  below, which the drift guards enforce). The immutability rule binds from the
  first release onward.
- Userland-to-kernel transitions use a single, documented syscall table per
  architecture. The table lives in `kernel/syscall/src/table.rs` and is
  generated from `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs` — do not edit either by hand
  without updating the other; `cargo xtask abi-check` enforces this.
- **The ABI is callable from non-Rust programs (C, …), and all of `lib/abi`
  is part of that surface** — every type a program exchanges with the kernel
  and system services, not just the syscalls. This is a one-way, outward-facing
  contract for **third-party** developers, not a reason to write C inside TAIRiX
  (§1). The C view — every public `#[repr(C)]` type, constant, enum
  discriminant, syscall number, error code, capability id, and a prototype per
  syscall — is **generated** from `lib/abi` into `include/` (§3), never
  hand-maintained (§2.2); `cargo xtask c-header --write` regenerates it and
  `cargo xtask c-header` (in `ci`) fails closed on drift. Each syscall is
  exported as the stable symbol `tairix_sys_<name>`, pinned with
  `#[export_name = …]` / `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` (so it is not mangled — `extern
  "C"` fixes only the calling convention). The stub runtime and program startup
  object (crt0) are an OS-provided shared library (§16.4) that only marshals to
  the kernel: **not** a privileged bypass — every capability and input check
  stays kernel-side (§5.4), and non-Rust binaries obey the `rxe`/`abi-v1`
  hardening invariants (PIE, W^X, CFI tag, §19.2) identically. Staged plan:
  `plans/CCOMPAT.md`.
- **C-ABI naming prefix (`tairix_` / `TAIRIX_`).** The C-visible surface is
  namespaced: exported symbols are `tairix_sys_<name>`, public macros are `TAIRIX_*`
  (`TAIRIX_E_*` errors, `TAIRIX_CAP_*` capability ids, `TAIRIX_SYS_*` syscall numbers),
  and `#[repr(C)]` type names are `tairix_<snake_case>_t`. This defends C's single
  flat symbol namespace against hostile/sloppy third-party code (§16.5), and
  the names freeze on the first release. **The prefix belongs only on the
  C-visible boundary** — exported symbols, public macros, and `#[repr(C)]` type
  names; it must never creep onto internal `lib/abi` Rust items, kernel-side
  functions, or anything that does not cross the FFI line (that would be §2.3
  bloat).

---

## 10. Desktop and Window Manager

- Traditional desktop (GNOME/Windows-style): a taskbar pinned to a configured
  screen edge, a filesystem browser, and drag-and-drop. The taskbar
  (`userland/gui/taskbar`) carries a "start" menu button on the left (session
  controls now, launcher entries later), a running-task list in the middle,
  and a clock with an adjacent notification-icon area on the right.
- Compositing window manager (`userland/gui/wm`). All compositing happens in
  user space; the kernel only ships framebuffer access through a capability.
  The compositor supports per-window rounded corners (anti-aliased, with a
  square-corner opt-out) and per-surface/per-region alpha transparency
  (correct premultiplied-alpha blending). The taskbar's rounded edges are
  drawn through that same compositor path — there is no second
  rounded-corner implementation (§2.2).
- Theming: a default dark theme plus a light theme, switchable at runtime,
  driving colours, corner radii, fonts, and cursors for the WM, taskbar, and
  default apps through one shared theme definition; adding a theme is data,
  not new code.
- Graphical assets are **scalable-first**, and every asset resolves through
  one total, three-tier rule. SVG is the canonical source format for
  *chrome* — cursors, notification and status glyphs, window furniture,
  theme decorations — where a monochrome, theme-tinted silhouette is the
  artwork, so it stays crisp at any DPI/UI scale and re-themes as data.
  **Illustrative icon artwork** (application, file-class, and device icons,
  whose visual identity is a rendered picture rather than a tintable
  silhouette) is authored as a high-resolution **raster master** instead: a
  square, straight-alpha PNG whose native resolution exceeds every slot the
  desktop draws it in, so downscaling — never upscaling — is what a slot
  needs. A raster master is a legitimate canonical source *only* for that
  class, and never for chrome.
  - **Every app ships its own icon, authored as a PNG raster master first.**
    A command-line or graphical application's own icon is **mandatory**: each
    bundle carries one icon asset inside its own `Resources/`, named by its
    signed manifest, so the taskbar, launcher, desktop, and file manager draw
    that app rather than the one generic application picture. An app's icon is
    illustrative artwork: author it as a raster master (above), a lit, shaded
    picture of what the program does, so its function reads at a glance. SVG
    remains a supported form, and the loader accepts it on the same terms, but
    the supported subset draws no soft shading, so a vector app icon reads as a
    flatter picture beside the rest of the set. Either way the build refuses a
    declared icon the desktop could not draw (absent, over-long, undecodable,
    a non-square, undersized, or untrimmed raster master, or one that draws
    nothing), so a broken icon is a build failure, never a silent fallback
    glyph (`plans/APPS.md` §14, `plans/ICONS.md`).
  - **The built-in vector glyph is mandatory for every icon, always.** An
    icon that exists only as a raster asset is forbidden: each kind carries a
    first-party built-in glyph, so resolution is total — raster artwork if
    the system ships and can decode it, else the on-disk vector asset, else
    the built-in glyph. A missing, oversize, corrupt, or refused asset
    therefore degrades to a meaningful icon and can never blank a surface
    (§2.9, §5.4).
  - Neither format is parsed or drawn on the hot compositing path: each asset
    is decoded and rasterised/converted **once** per (asset, pixel side) at
    the active `tairix_geometry::Scale` into the fast-draw form the
    compositor blits, cached under the memory-pressure model, and re-rendered
    only when the scale or theme changes. There is exactly one
    rasterisation/blend path (`lib/raster`) and one decode-and-fit path; a
    second is forbidden (§2.2).
  - Both formats are untrusted input: they are decoded through the curated
    §16.4 image-decoding libraries in a §19.5 minimum-capability sandbox,
    never an ad-hoc parser, under a fixed input-byte and output-side bound
    (§24.4), and a malformed asset fails closed to the tier below it rather
    than crashing the compositor. This binds a system asset as firmly as a
    third-party bundle's own icon: the desktop trusts pixels it has
    validated, never a file.
- Variable DPI is a first-class, **settable** desktop property. Every desktop
  length — corner radii, border thicknesses, font sizes, taskbar extents,
  window chrome — is authored in *logical* pixels at a fixed reference density
  (`tairix_geometry::REFERENCE_DPI`) and converted to *physical* pixels through
  one shared scale factor (`tairix_geometry::Scale`). There is exactly one
  logical→physical conversion (`Scale::scale_length`), consumed by the WM,
  taskbar, cursors, and apps, so the arithmetic is never duplicated (§2.2). The
  scale is changeable at runtime; an out-of-range scale is rejected at
  construction (§5.4 / §2.9).
- Login: `userland/session/login` always starts in text mode and offers to launch the
  graphical session. If no graphics driver loads, the graphical option is
  hidden — never crashed, never errored.

## 11. Installer

- `userland/system/installer` runs on first boot of any image.
- It must:
  1. Prompt for system name (hostname).
  2. Prompt for the first user (username, password, full name, primary group).
  3. Offer the secure default layout defined in §16:
     - Encrypted root (LUKS-equivalent using `lib/crypto`).
     - Encrypted swap (§4). Swap is keyed by an ephemeral per-boot
       random key that is never written to disk, so the default needs
       no passphrase and leaves nothing recoverable at rest. The
       installer never lays out plaintext swap, and expert mode may not
       create it.
     - `/System` mounted read-only (the only writable paths inside it
       are `/System/Logs` and `/System/Settings`, and they are mounted
       `nosuid,nodev,noexec`).
     - `/Users` mounted `nosuid,nodev`.
     - `/Apps` mounted `nosuid,nodev` (application binaries are
       capability-gated, not setuid).
     - `/Storage` mounted `nosuid,nodev,noexec` by default; per-volume
       overrides are capability-gated.
  4. Allow expert mode for manual partitioning, but the default is the
     secure layout. Expert mode may not introduce legacy POSIX top-level
     directories (`/etc`, `/home`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/proc`, `/lib`,
     `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt`, `/root`, `/tmp`, `/dev`); those names are
     reserved and refused by the installer.
  5. Generate a per-installation machine ID and signing key for the local
     capability authority.
- The installer is the same binary on every platform; platform specifics
  (e.g. EFI vars, Pi config.txt) live behind a `Platform` trait in
  `lib/abi/src/platform.rs`.

---

## 12. Build and Images

- `cargo xtask build --target <platform>` produces:
  - `images/tairix-x86_64.iso` (hybrid BIOS/UEFI, USB-writable)
  - `images/tairix-aarch64-rpi-<profile>.img` (SD-card writable; the
    `--profile` flag selects `installer` — the shippable form, no user
    accounts — or `debug`, the development form seeded with the
    `root`/`root` test account, which must never ship)
  - `images/tairix-riscv64.img`
  - `images/tairix-web/` (static tree for Apache/Nginx, contains `.wasm`,
    `.html`, `.js` glue, and a service worker)
- Image builders live in `tools/mkimage`. They are pure Rust; no shelling out
  to `mkfs`, `parted`, `xorriso`, etc., except via `tools/mkimage`'s
  audited wrappers in `tools/mkimage/src/extern_tools.rs`. Every external
  invocation is checksummed and version-pinned.
- The boot chain that starts the kernel from a shipped image on real
  firmware — the `images/tairix-x86_64.iso` hybrid BIOS/UEFI target above —
  is a first-party, Rust-only loader (no GRUB, no C): the pure loader core
  (`lib/bootload`) plus the per-firmware `boot/*` shells, handing the kernel
  off through its existing multiboot2 entry. The staged design is
  `plans/BOOTLOADER.md`; QEMU's `-kernel` PVH shortcut stays the fast,
  firmware-free test path.

---

## 13. Documentation Rules

- Every public item has rustdoc.
- Every subsystem has a page under `docs/src/`.
- Documentation is reviewed and updated **in the same commit** as the code
  it describes.
- No "aimless waffle". If a paragraph does not change the reader's ability
  to use or maintain the system, delete it.
- The `README.md` feature/architecture support matrix is part of the docs:
  every implemented feature whose support varies by target has one terse row,
  and the matrix is updated in the same change that adds the feature or
  changes its per-architecture state. Marks only, no prose.
- **Review `README.md` periodically for currency.** Beyond the same-change
  update obligation above, `README.md` (its orientation text, the
  feature/architecture support matrix, the security & attack-vector matrix,
  the filesystem block, and the build instructions) is reviewed periodically
  — at minimum at every release/stage boundary (when `PLAN.md` advances a
  stage, §14) and whenever a change touches a feature the README describes —
  to confirm it still matches the real state of the tree. Any drift found
  (a stale mark, a missing or removed feature, an out-of-date instruction)
  is corrected in that same change, never deferred (§2.14, §2.18). A reviewer
  applying the §23 gate treats a `README.md` that no longer reflects reality
  as a defect.
- **Planning files state the current plan and state, not history. Git is the
  changelog; `PLAN.md` and `plans/*.md` are not.** This binds `PLAN.md`, every
  `plans/*.md`, and any other planning/status/roadmap document.
  - Each item records only what it *is* now: the deliverables, the design
    decisions and invariants a future reader needs, the current status
    (`planned` / `in progress` / `done` / `blocked`), and the work that
    *remains*. Keep the load-bearing implementation facts (key types, file
    locations, capability/ABI contracts, deliberate carve-outs).
  - **Do not** narrate how the work happened. No per-increment landing logs
    ("X landed, then Y landed"), no commit hashes or dated session entries, no
    "verified green"/quoted CI/test-run output, no superseded or "historical"
    design discussion, no renumbering history, no restating a rule the charter
    already states. When a piece of work completes, **replace** its plan/status
    prose with a concise done-state summary — do not append a new log entry
    beside the old one (§2.14: delete obsolete text).
  - The test that a line belongs in a plan file: it tells a future contributor
    what to build next or what a finished part now guarantees. If instead it
    records *what was done when*, it belongs in the commit message (§14), not
    here. Bloated, changelog-style plan files waste the limited context an AI
    (or human) can hold and are a review blocker (§2.3).
  - The exception is `PLAN.md`'s "Charter Amendments" section, which logs *why*
    an `AGENTS.md` rule exists; keep each entry to a one-line rationale.
- **Every planning file opens with a progress ledger, and the ledger is kept
  current.** `PLAN.md` and every `plans/*.md` carries a status table at the
  **top**, ahead of the prose: one row per deliverable item, each with a stable
  item id, a one-line statement of what the item *is*, and its status —
  `planned`, `in progress`, `done`, or `blocked`, a blocked row naming what
  blocks it. A reader, human or AI, must be able to see what is built and what
  is left without reading the plan, and must be able to cite an item by id.
  - **It is updated in the same change that moves an item's status**, exactly
    as the code's docs are. A ledger that disagrees with the tree is a stale
    doc and a reviewer treats it as the defect it is.
  - **It stays a ledger, not a log.** A finished item's row says `done` and its
    prose says what the finished part now guarantees. The ledger never grows a
    dated history, a per-increment landing record, or a second row for the same
    item — that is the changelog the rule above forbids.
  - **The table is the only place status is recorded.** Status repeated in the
    prose is a second copy to keep in sync and drifts; the prose states the
    design and the invariants, the ledger states where the work is.
  - **Plans predating this rule adopt it with the next body of work they
    stage**, not in a sweep and not on an incidental edit: the ledger arrives
    when there is work to record in it, so the gap closes with the work rather
    than as a formatting pass. A plan that predates the rule is not a defect
    for lacking a ledger; a plan whose work moved without its ledger moving
    is.
- `cargo xtask docs-check` runs:
  - `cargo doc` with `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`,
  - mdBook build,
  - link checker,
  - a "stale doc" check that fails if a file in `docs/src/` references a
    symbol that no longer exists.

---

## 14. Commit / PR Discipline

- **AI agents are FORBIDDEN from committing to git or pushing.** An AI agent
  MUST NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, or any other command that writes a
  commit or publishes to a remote (e.g. `git commit --amend`, `git rebase`,
  `git merge`, `git tag`, `git push --force`, or a `git` alias/hook that does
  any of these). Creating commits and pushing are reserved exclusively for the
  human contributor, who reviews the agent's working-tree changes first. The
  agent's deliverable is the modified working tree plus its completion report
  (§23.5), never a commit or a push. This is binding and as non-negotiable as
  §2; circumventing it (staging-and-committing in one command, scripting git,
  or asking another tool to commit) is a §2.1 hack and a review blocker.
- One logical change per commit.
- Commit message format:
  ```
  <area>: <imperative summary, ≤ 72 chars>

  <body explaining *why*, wrapped at 72>

  Tests: <what you ran>
  Docs:  <what you updated>
  ```
- A PR is mergeable only when:
  - `cargo xtask ci` passes locally and in CI,
  - the §23 Code Review and Acceptance Gate has been applied and passes,
  - all reviewer comments are resolved,
  - `PLAN.md` is updated if a stage was advanced.

## 15. Instructions Specifically for AI Agents

You are not exempt from any rule above. In addition:

1. **Do not be lazy.** If the task is large, decompose it and complete each
   piece properly. Do not stub functions with `todo!()` and call the work done.
2. **Do not invent APIs.** If you need an interface that does not exist,
   propose it in `PLAN.md` and wait for approval, or implement it fully —
   including tests and docs — as part of the same change.
3. **Do not silence tests, warnings, or lints.** Fix the underlying problem.
4. **Do not duplicate code to avoid a refactor.** Refactor.
5. **Do not add "convenience" wrappers** unless they are used in at least two
   independent places and documented.
6. **Run the full test suite over the *entire* project** before reporting a
   task complete — never a per-crate (`-p`) subset, and never skipped except
   under the single §2.15 exemption (a change confined to `plans/*.md`,
   `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md`). At minimum this means
   `cargo fmt --all`, the complete `cargo xtask ci` pipeline run **exactly
   once** (it is internally idempotent — a second consecutive `cargo xtask ci`
   is pure waste and is forbidden), and a fuzzing run of at least 5 seconds
   (`cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5`), plus whatever `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
   **beyond `cargo xtask ci` itself** — the `tools/ci/soak.sh` soak, never a
   second `cargo xtask ci` (see §7's "Definition of done").
   `tools/ci/soak.sh` is run on a developer machine (that's us) for a
   **maximum of 20 seconds** — `tools/ci/soak.sh both --secs 20` — never the
   unbounded 24 h nightly budget, which belongs to the CI/soak host alone.
   Quote the actual output. Any failure found — yours or pre-existing — is
   fixed before the task is done. **Watch each run to completion and report
   the status it actually produced**, per §7's rule of that name: wait in the
   foreground wherever you can, and where a single tool call cannot span the
   run, capture the exit code durably and read it back rather than inferring
   it. Finish every edit before launching, do no other work while it runs, and
   never poll a log in place of waiting — arm one waiter for the run's
   completion and then leave it alone. Repeated "how far has it got" checks buy
   nothing the completion signal does not, and spend the context the rest of
   the work needs.
7. **State your assumptions** at the top of any non-trivial change. If an
   assumption cannot be verified from the repository, stop and ask.
8. **Never** edit generated files, `target/`, or `.idea/` content as part of
   a feature change.
9. **Never** weaken the security model "to get the test to pass". The test
   is correct; your code is wrong.
10. If you are about to write `// HACK`, `// FIXME later`, `// works for now`,
    or `#[allow(...)]` without a justification comment — **stop**. Rework
    the change.
11. **Write Rust, never C.** All code you produce for TAIRiX is Rust (§1).
    You **MUST NOT** author C or C++ — no `.c`, `.h`, `.cc`, `.cpp`, or
    other non-Rust source, no hand-written C headers, no C build glue. The
    C-callable ABI (§9, §16.4) is published **for third-party developers**
    to consume from their own projects; it is not a task for you to write C
    here. The only non-Rust text you may ever add is one of the small,
    individually justified assembly fragments §1 permits (CPU bring-up,
    MMU/TLB/context-switch primitives), and only with the required header
    justification and review. The C headers under `include/` are
    **generated** from `lib/abi` by `cargo xtask c-header --write` — never
    hand-write or hand-edit them (§2.2, §9). If a task appears to ask you to
    write C, you have misunderstood it: stop and ask (§15.7).
12. **Review your own output against §23 before reporting done.** Run the
    Code Review and Acceptance Gate adversarially over your own diff —
    security (§23.1), correctness and multi-arch (§23.2), no
    backwards-compatibility and no dead code (§23.3, §2.13, §2.14), and
    tests/docs/process (§23.4) — and state the verdict (§23.5). A green
    compile and green tests do not make a change done.
13. **Never say "for now". Finish it or escalate (§2.19).** Do not deliver a
    knowingly partial, stubbed, or "temporary" solution and call the work done.
    If the correct solution depends on prerequisite work that is not yet done,
    do that prerequisite as part of the same change. If finishing it properly
    conflicts with another rule, an in-flight design, or an irreconcilable
    requirement, **stop and ask the User to decide** (§15.7) — never pick the
    "for now" compromise yourself, and never bury the deferral in a comment or
    omit it from the completion report.
14. **Write platform-neutral code; never tie generic code to a board (§2.20).**
    Anything you write that is meant to be shared or multi-architecture — a
    `lib/*` crate, an arch-neutral `kernel/*` subsystem, the driver host or a
    core driver framework, or `userland/*` — must contain no Raspberry Pi /
    BCM / specific-SoC / specific-MMIO-base reference, name, constant, or `cfg`.
    Platform specifics belong **only** in `kernel/arch/<target>/` (and the §1
    boot-stub carve-out), reached at runtime through discovery (§18.1, §18.2);
    a concrete device's own driver/support crate may know its device but is
    reached only via the discovery/match path (§18.3) and never inside a
    generic framework. If you cannot write it generically, the HAL is
    incomplete — extend `kernel/arch/api/` and stop and ask (§15.7).
15. **Write the least arch-specific code possible, and look across all
    archs before writing any (§2.21).** Put a line under
    `kernel/arch/<target>/` only when the silicon strictly requires it
    (register layout, privileged instruction, MMU/TLB/context-switch
    primitive, errata mitigation, discovery source); everything that can be
    expressed once over the Arch HAL (§17.2) and `lib/*` must be. When you
    touch one architecture, check the sibling architectures for the same
    logic: if it is (or will be) identical, hoist it into a shared home
    (`lib/*`, an arch-neutral `kernel/*` subsystem, or a `kernel/arch/api/`
    default) so all targets share one definition — never leave a common
    routine stranded in one arch's file to be copied into the others later.
    If there is no shared home yet, create or extend one (§6, §17.2); if that
    is too large for this change, stop and ask (§15.7) — do not duplicate it
    "for now" (§2.19).
16. **Never commit to git or push (§14).** You are FORBIDDEN from running
    `git commit`, `git push`, or any command that writes a commit or publishes
    to a remote (including `git commit --amend`, `git rebase`, `git merge`,
    `git tag`, `git push --force`, and any git alias/hook/script that does so).
    You leave your changes in the working tree for the human contributor to
    review and commit. Do not stage-and-commit in one command, script git to
    commit, or delegate the commit to another tool — that is the §2.1 hack this
    rule forbids. Your deliverable is the modified tree plus the §23.5
    completion report, never a commit or a push.
17. **Comment tersely, never mimic a file's waffle, and never cite a charter
    section number (§2.11).** Write the minimum *why* and stop — a line or two,
    no essays, no narration, no restating the code or the rustdoc above it —
    and prefer code clear enough to need no comment at all. Finding pages of
    prose in a file you are editing is **not** permission to write more of it:
    that prose is unswept waffle (`plans/WAFFLE.md`), never a style to match,
    and "I followed the surrounding style" is not a defence. The charter's bar
    binds in every file regardless of what is already there; trim the waffle in
    the lines you touch and add none.
    The section-number ban is separate and absolute: the rule already lives in
    `AGENTS.md`, so repeating "(§5.4)" / "`AGENTS.md` §2.9" / "sec.5.4" in a
    comment is the noise §2.11 forbids. Explain the *why* in plain prose and
    stop ("fail closed", "zeroed on drop"); where the charter itself is the
    subject, write "the charter forbids …", never the number.
    Cross-references to *other* files/specs/plans/papers (an external spec, a
    hardware manual, `plans/PI.md`, a sibling module) are fine; citing this
    charter is not. The only place a charter section number belongs is a
    generator that stamps provenance onto a generated artefact, or a runtime
    diagnostic that tells a developer which rule they broke — neither is a
    hand-written comment.
18. **Check the `plans/` jump-sheet before touching a covered area.** Every
    document under `plans/` is binding under this charter (§3). Before you
    design, implement, review, or assess anything that touches an area
    below, read the matching plan(s) first — they carry the staged design
    decisions, invariants, and deliberate carve-outs this charter does not
    repeat — and keep them current in the same change (§13). If your change
    contradicts a plan, stop and ask (§15.7); never silently diverge from

    The sheet is maintained like any other doc (§2.8, §2.14): a new
    `plans/*.md` enters this table in the change that creates it, and a
    deleted or superseded plan leaves it in the change that removes it.

19. **Run the oracles where they apply, and say which ones looked (§19.11).**
    A green `cargo xtask ci` proves only that the crates *enrolled* in the
    `miri` and `loom` stages were interpreted — not that anything looked at
    your `unsafe`. If your change adds or alters `unsafe` in a crate outside
    `miri`'s `TARGETS`, enrol it (preferred) or run
    `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p <crate>` and quote
    it in the completion report (§23.5). If it touches a synchronisation
    primitive, a lock-free protocol, or an `Acquire`/`Release` pairing whose
    correctness depends on ordering, write the loom model and run
    `cargo xtask loom`. State the reasoning either way: "loom N/A because X"
    is an answer, silence is not. These oracles routinely find what the whole
    test matrix structurally cannot — a pointer carrying no provenance, a
    padding byte read as data, a cross-CPU flag loaded through a shared borrow
    the compiler may hoist out of its spin loop. Never narrow an enrolment to
    make a finding go away (§2.18).

20. **Other agents do read-only scoping work only; the main agent alone
    edits the tree.** A subagent, a background agent, or a second session on
    the same checkout may search, read, and analyse the tree and report what
    it found — nothing else. It never edits, creates, deletes, moves, or
    reformats a file, never builds, tests, or runs the gate, and never runs a
    `git` command that writes. Every edit is the main agent's own, so the
    tree it fingerprints and the gate result it reports describe one author's
    change. Brief a delegated agent as read-only and prefer a read-only agent
    type. A live peer session on the checkout is asked to quit, never given a
    share of the work. A tree that changes under you anyway is a stop-and-ask
    (§15.7): never merge it, revert it, or work around it.

## 16. OS Filesystem Layout (authoritative)

This section governs the **installed system's** on-disk layout, not the
source repository (the source layout is §3). It is binding.

### 16.1 Top-level directories

TAIRiX exposes **exactly four** entries in the default session root
view. Anything else in that view is a defect.

```
/            # the default session root view — a projection, not storage identity
├── System/    # All OS-provided files. Read-only at runtime.
├── Users/     # One subdirectory per user account.
├── Apps/      # Installed applications. One bundle per app.
└── Storage/   # Catalog/view of published non-core storage roots.
```

These four are synthetic **view bindings** backed by the first-class
aliases `System:`, `Users:`, `Apps:`, and `Storage:`, not the canonical
identity of storage. The canonical identity of a storage root is its root
ID (`id::<volume-id>/…`) or its alias path (`Alias:/…`), never the `/`
view path: a process holding the authority to open `Backup:/file` can do
so even when the `/` view or the `Storage:` catalog is absent, corrupt,
or deliberately hidden. TAIRiX storage is a forest of independently
addressable named roots projected into `/` for POSIX-ish convenience —
`/` is a generated view, not the root of storage. The full model
(grammar, resolver table, alias policy, capabilities, and lifecycle) is
the binding storage-namespace spec (`docs/src/filesystem/drives.md`).
Creating an additional entry in the default root view requires amending
this section.

The following legacy POSIX names are ones **the OS itself never creates**
as top-level view entries: `/etc`, `/home`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/proc`,
`/sys`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt`, `/root`, `/tmp`,
`/dev`, `/mnt`, `/media`, `/run`, `/boot`. The OS lays out only the four
view entries above: the installer refuses to lay any legacy name out, the
image builder authors only the four, and any driver or in-tree userland
code that hard-codes or creates one of these paths is a defect.

This is a rule the **OS** keeps to, not a structural ban the kernel
imposes on userland. The kernel filesystem layer does **not** police a
user's own request: a user who holds the authority to write to the root
directory (its owner/mode/ACL, §5.3) may create a top-level entry of any
name, legacy or not, exactly as any other directory — there is no
separate capability for it and no error reserved for the name. Production
`/` is owned by the system user with a restrictive mode, so an
unprivileged user cannot create a top-level entry of *any* name; a
privileged one may. The OS simply never authors the legacy names itself.

There is **no OS-provided `/proc`** and **no `/sys`**: the OS does not
create them and nothing in the system relies on them. Live system
information is exposed exclusively through the System Information API
(§16.6).

### 16.2 `/System`

`/System` contains every file that ships as part of the OS. It is
mounted read-only at runtime. The installer and the updater are the
only components permitted to mutate it, and only by re-mounting it
read-write under `CAP_SYSTEM_UPDATE`.

Authoritative subdirectories:

```

                 #   `init` (entered by the boot path before any volume is
                 #   mounted) is the compiled-in boot floor (§18.6).
```

Adding a new top-level subdirectory under `/System` requires updating
this section and `PLAN.md`. Subdirectories outside this list are a
defect.

`/System/Security/MachineId` is the per-installation **machine-id**: the
TAIRiX equivalent of `/etc/machine-id`, a stable public per-installation
identifier. It is **not a secret** — unlike the material under `Keys/` it is
world-readable (owner-writable), so any principal may read it while only the
system user may rewrite it. It is the single on-disk source of truth for the
machine identity every consumer reads (the system log binds each stream's
hash-chain genesis to its hash, §7.1/SYSLOG). The installer mints it at
first boot and the image builder bakes a random one into a debug image; an
unprovisioned system simply has no file, and a consumer fails closed rather
than fabricating one.

`/System/Logs` and `/System/Settings` are the only writable paths
beneath `/System`. They are mounted `nosuid,nodev,noexec`; the rest of
`/System` is read-only. Write access is gated first by the per-inode
owner/mode/ACL model (§5.3) under the caller's kernel-attested identity —
these subtrees are owned by the system user with restrictive modes, so
ordinary principals read but do not write. A *dedicated* write capability
(a `CAP_LOG_WRITE` for the journal, a `CAP_SETTINGS_WRITE` for the settings
service) is introduced **with the service that holds and enforces it**, not
ahead of it — per the capability-minimalism rule (§5.2), a capability with
no live holder or enforcement point is not added in advance.

Drivers under `/System/Drivers/` are grouped by device class or bus type,
never by vendor (§8): the namespace is `/System/Drivers/<class>[_<subtype>]/`
(e.g. `bus_usb/`, `display/`, `storage/`) and a vendor or product name appears
**only** as the leaf *directory* that holds the driver file(s) — so
`/System/Drivers/bus_usb/broadcom_chip_1234/<driver>` is correct, while
`/System/Drivers/broadcom_usb/broadusb1234` (vendor as a namespace segment) is a
defect.

### 16.3 `/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage`

- `/Users/<username>/` is the only place user-owned files live. It
  contains at least `Documents/`, `Settings/`, `Library/` (per-user
  caches/state, **not** shared libraries), `Commands/` and
  `Applications/` (the user's own two program stores, mirroring the
  system pair and organisable in nested plain subdirectories), and
  `Desktop/`. The shape is fixed; applications may not invent sibling
  directories at this level.
  `Settings/Apps/<bundle-id>/` and `Library/Apps/<bundle-id>/` are the
  **per-app data roots**, keyed on the app's *signed bundle identifier* and
  never on its display name. An application never reaches them itself: the
  `Apps` parent is owned by the app-data service and carries
  `required_cap = CAP_APPDATA_ADMIN`, so the whole tree is reachable only
  through that service, which gates every request on the caller's
  kernel-attested app identity. A per-app directory could not be the gate
  itself — every app of a user may write `Settings/`, so any of them could
  pre-create a sibling named after another app's identifier.
  A configuration store holds three scopes: a **private** document no other
  principal may read, a **published** one any application may read through a
  request shape that cannot name the private scope at all, and a **sealed** one
  holding that application's secrets, encrypted at rest under a key the service
  derives per (account, application). The published scope is what keeps
  app-from-app isolation complete rather than merely strict — two applications
  that must share a value have exactly one sanctioned channel, so none has to
  invent a path under `CAP_FS_ACCESS`. The sealed scope is reached by operations
  that carry no scope field and have no foreign counterpart, so no
  configuration request can name a secret and none reaches another
  application's; it has no layer beneath it, because a secret an application did
  not write is not one it may be made to believe.
  The bulk root holds two more scopes, both reached as a **descriptor** rather
  than as bytes, so the service makes the policy decision once at open and the
  application then works directly against the kernel VFS at full speed.
  `Blobs/<name>` is durable and the application names it: its index, cache, or
  queue. `Temp/` is the scratch of one run, and the **service** names each
  file — freshness with no coordination is what a temporary file is for, and
  nothing *opens* one, so an application can never read scratch it did not
  write in this process. Their lifetime is the boot: a file an earlier boot
  left is reachable by nothing and is reclaimed before the next is created.
  There is still no `/tmp` and the OS still never creates one (§16.1).
  What either scope hands over is bounded — a one-shot delegation carrying only
  the access it asked for and, when it writes, a byte-extent ceiling the kernel
  enforces — because the gated tree is owned by the app-data service, so no
  per-user filesystem quota would ever see those bytes and the service is the
  only thing that can bound them. A count ceiling per scope and one per-file
  byte ceiling for the tree are **fixed containment bounds** (§24.4), not
  capacities: they bound what one application may hide in a store the user
  cannot list or delete, and data that genuinely outgrows one is the user's and
  belongs in the user's own files. One ownership pin governs every scope in both
  trees, because it attests who owns the application's *data* and not who owns
  one file.
  See `plans/APPDATA.md`.
  `/Users` is mounted `nosuid,nodev`.
  A store carries the same directory name at every scope, so the user's
  own stores are exactly the system stores' names under their home; both
  are on the fixed lookup order (§16.8) after the system pair, which is
  what makes a user's own commands typeable with no `PATH` edit. `man`'s
  recursive bundle search walks them after `/Apps`.
- `/Apps/<Name>.app/` is the only place machine-wide applications live
  (see §16.5); a user's own bundles live under their own two stores above.
  Bundles in any of these stores may be filed in nested plain
  subdirectories (`/Apps/games/chess.app`), and `man`'s recursive bundle
  search finds their help wherever they are filed — a `.app` directory
  itself is a sealed unit, never a container of further apps. `/Apps` is
  mounted `nosuid,nodev`. It is deliberately **not** on the fixed lookup
  order (§16.8): a machine-wide installed bundle is launched by the
  desktop or by an explicit path, and appears on the command path only if
  the user adds it to `PATH`. Apps acquire privilege through capabilities
  declared in their manifest, never through setuid.
- `/Storage/<volume>/` is where mounted volumes appear (removable media,
  extra disks, network shares). Default mount flags are
  `nosuid,nodev,noexec`; relaxations require `CAP_FS_MOUNT_RELAX` and
  are recorded in the audit log.

### 16.4 Shared libraries

The OS ships a **closed, curated set** of shared libraries under
`/System/Libraries/`. They are the only shared libraries on the system.
The permitted classes are:

- Windowing / compositor client
- Font rendering
- Image decoding (raster formats plus vector SVG; SVG is the canonical
  source format for WM/desktop graphical assets — see §10)
- Media (audio/video) decoding and playback
- Archive extraction
- Printing
- TLS / cryptography (via `lib/crypto`)
- Networking (sockets, DNS, HTTP client)
- Terminal / TUI client: the curses screen-model library
  (`lib/curses`) and the terminal-capability database and
  escape-sequence vocabulary it builds on (`lib/termcap`, `lib/vt`).
  It is part of the OS, so apps dynamically link it like any other
  `/System/Libraries/` library (§10 — text-mode infrastructure).
- System runtime / C ABI: the minimal libc-equivalent that lets a **non**-Rust
  program call `abi-v1` (§9) — the `tairix_sys_<name>` syscall stubs and the
  startup object (crt0). It only marshals to the kernel and starts/stops the
  program; it is **not** a privileged path (every check stays kernel-side,
  §5.4) and third-party native code is treated as hostile (§5, §19). Staged
  in `plans/CCOMPAT.md`.

Adding a new class of OS-provided shared library requires an update to
this list **and** to `PLAN.md`. "Convenience" libraries are forbidden.

Apps link the curated `/System/Libraries/` set **dynamically** (so one
security update covers every consumer); OS-bundled apps **must not** vendor or
statically compile-in OS libraries. Third-party apps bring any *additional*
(non-OS) libraries in their own bundle — statically, or dynamically from the
bundle's `Libraries/` (§16.5), never installed system-wide — and still
dynamically link the OS libraries rather than re-implement them. The dynamic
loader refuses any shared-library reference outside the requesting app's own
`Libraries/` or `/System/Libraries/`. (Internal `lib/*` building blocks not in
a curated class are linked statically; a `lib/*` crate that *is* part of a
curated class — e.g. the curses/terminal client — is an OS-provided library and
dynamically linked.)

### 16.5 Application bundles (`.app`)

An installed application is a directory named `<Name>.app` placed
directly under `/Apps/`. The bundle layout is fixed:

```
/Apps/Example.app/
├── AppInfo            # Signed manifest. Required. See below.
├── Run                # Entry-point rxe binary. Required.
├── Code/              # Additional rxe binaries / plugins.
├── Libraries/         # Private shared libraries used only by this app.
├── Resources/         # Images, locales, UI definitions, etc.
├── DefaultSettings/   # Read-only defaults. A fallback *layer* beneath the
│                      # app's own store, never copied anywhere: an update
│                      # ships new defaults that take effect at once, and
│                      # the user's own file holds only what they changed.
└── Help/              # Internationalised structured-Markdown help: one
                       # document per command/topic, one directory per
                       # BCP-47 locale; the mandatory canonical one is en-US/.
                       # The single source for `man`, short `-h`/`-?` help,
                       # and any graphical help viewer (plans/APPS.md).
```

Exactly these names are permitted at the top of a bundle; additional
entries are a packaging defect and the loader will refuse the bundle.

**The bundle is self-contained; every part of the app lives inside its
`<Name>.app/` folder, and nothing that is part of the app lives anywhere
else.** This is the whole point of the `.app` folder: an application *is*
its bundle directory. Everything the app is made of — its entry-point `Run`
binary, any additional `Code/` rxe binaries or plugins, its `AppInfo`
manifest, its `Resources/`, its `DefaultSettings/`, its `Help/` tree, and any
static or private shared library unique to *this* app — is a real file on disk
**inside that folder**. The only things an app legitimately reaches outside its
own bundle are the OS-provided surfaces every app shares: the curated
`/System/Libraries/` shared libraries (§16.4, dynamically linked) and the
kernel syscall/IPC ABI (§9). There is no third place an app's own code, data,
or help may live.

- **An app's code is NEVER compiled into, embedded in, or served from the
  kernel, the image builder, or any other component.** The `Run` binary (and
  every `Code/` binary) is an `rxe` file authored **on the volume inside the
  bundle**, loaded and launched through `appmgr` with the full signature +
  capability + interface-hash checks (§9, §18). Baking an application's
  `rxe` into the kernel image and dispatching it by a byte-exact in-kernel path
  lookup, embedding an app binary via `include_bytes!` / `include!` into a
  kernel or tool crate, or shipping a compiled-in registry of "which apps
  exist", is exactly the defect this rule forbids: it makes the app *not*
  self-contained, hides it from the on-disk bundle a user browses (a bundle
  directory that shows only `Help/` because `Run` lives in the kernel is this
  defect), and bypasses the `appmgr` verification path. An app that is not a
  complete, launchable, verifiable directory under `/Apps` (or one of the
  `/System` program stores, §16.2) is a defect, regardless of whether it runs.
- **The bundle is the only home for the app's own libraries.** A static
  library or private shared library used *only* by this app is built into the
  bundle — statically linked into its binaries, or placed in the bundle's
  `Libraries/` for private dynamic linking (§16.4). It is never installed
  system-wide, never hoisted into `/System/Libraries/` (the closed, curated OS
  set, §16.4), and never carried in the kernel. Shared code used by *more than
  one* first-party component is a `lib/*` crate (§6) linked at build time into
  each consumer's own bundle binary — not a runtime dependency reached for
  outside the folder.
- **The store is discovered from the on-disk bundles, never from a compiled-in
  list.** The set of apps (including the system programs under
  `/System/Commands` and `/System/Applications`, §16.2) is discovered at
  runtime by scanning the on-disk
  bundles and reading each `AppInfo`, exactly as drivers are discovered from
  their signed bundles (§18.3, §18.6). A hand-maintained compiled-in table of
  apps — in the kernel, `tools/mkimage`, a test fixture, or anywhere else — is
  the duplication §2.2 forbids and a review blocker; adding an app is dropping
  its `.app` folder on disk, never editing a central list.

`AppInfo` is the application manifest. It is a signed document (see §9)
and declares at minimum:

- Bundle identifier, human-readable name, version.
- The program's kind — `command`, `application`, or `service` — which is
  what decides the store the bundle installs into (§16.2, §16.8) and is the
  only place that decision is recorded.
- Target ABI version (`abi-vN`) and required syscall hashes.
- The exact set of capabilities the app requests (§5.2). The kernel
  grants only the intersection of these with the launching user's
  grants; ambient authority is forbidden (§4).
- Declared MIME / file-type associations.
- The signer's identity and signature over the bundle contents.
- The **publisher** identity: the developer's stable public key, plus a
  certificate delegating this build's signing key to it when the two differ.
  The signing key may rotate every release; the publisher is what per-app
  stored state is owned by, so a re-signed release keeps its data and a
  different developer claiming the same identifier is refused
  (`plans/APPDATA.md`).

Apps may not write outside their own per-user state, and they never write it
directly: it lives under `Settings/Apps/<bundle-id>/` and
`Library/Apps/<bundle-id>/` (§16.3), keyed on the *signed bundle identifier*
rather than the display name, and is reachable only through the app-data
service, which derives the store from the caller's kernel-attested app
identity. All other writes require a user-mediated capability (e.g. a file
picker handing the app a one-shot file capability).

**Command help is authored in the bundle, never hardcoded into the program
or the image builder.** A command's help — the structured-Markdown documents
`man` renders, the short `-h`/`-?` surface, and any graphical help viewer
(plans/APPS.md) — is authored in exactly **one** place: the bundle's own
on-disk `Help/<locale>/<doc>.md` files. It is consumed at runtime through the
injected, capability-scoped read seam (`lib/help`'s `HelpSource`), reading only
the running bundle's own `Help/` tree.

- A program MUST NOT embed, hardcode, or compile-in its own help text: no
  `include_str!`/`include_bytes!` of the `Help/` tree into the `Run`/`Code/`
  binary, no help strings baked into the program, no second copy of a document
  anywhere but the bundle. Help is *data on the volume*, resolved at runtime —
  never a constant in the executable. A hand-written `help.rs` that embeds the
  bundle's documents is exactly the defect this rule forbids.
- The tooling that lays the `Help/` trees onto `/System` (`tools/syshelp`, read
  by `tools/mkimage` and the QEMU image fixtures) **discovers** them from the
  bundles' own on-disk sources. Adding a command app's help is dropping its
  `Help/` files on disk — never editing a central per-bundle list in the image
  builder, a test fixture, or the kernel. A per-bundle list that a new bundle
  forces an edit to, or a bundle's help duplicated into the builder, is the
  duplication §2.2 forbids and a review blocker.
- Internationalisation is the shared engine's job (§2.2): locale selection
  falls back deterministically — the exact BCP-47 tag, then the same language
  in any region, then the mandatory canonical `en-US/` — inside the one
  `lib/help` engine, never a per-app locale walker. A missing or partial
  translation degrades to `en-US/`, never to fabricated or hardcoded text
  (§2.9).

### 16.6 System Information API

Because there is no `/proc` or `/sys`, every piece of information that
would have lived there is exposed through a single, versioned,
capability-checked API: the **System Information API** (`sysinfo`).

- The API is defined in `lib/abi/src/sysinfo.rs` and served by a
  user-space system service under `/System/Services/`.
- Each query is a typed request returning a typed response; there is
  no free-form text scraping interface. Adding a query requires the
  same ABI discipline as a syscall (§9): versioned, hashed, frozen
  on release.
- Every query declares the capability it requires. Unprivileged queries
  (e.g. "list my own processes") need none; privileged queries (e.g.
  "list all processes system-wide", "read kernel memory stats") require
  capabilities such as `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` or `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`.
- A single command-line tool, `sysinfo`, in `userland/shell/`, exposes
  the same API to the terminal. It does **not** open files in a virtual
  filesystem; it calls the API. There is no privileged path that
  bypasses the capability check.

Any in-tree code that needs runtime system data uses this API.
Fabricating a `/proc`-style virtual filesystem, even "just for
compatibility", is forbidden.

### 16.7 System command apps follow GNU coreutils

The OS-provided command apps in the system command store (§16.2) — `ls`, `cat`,
`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `ps`, `top`, and the rest of the familiar command set — are
written to match **GNU coreutils** (and, for the process/system tools, the
established `procps`/coreutils command surface) as closely as possible. A user
or script that knows the GNU tool must find the TAIRiX tool's options and
output already familiar; the burden of proof is on any *deviation*, not on the
compatibility.

- **Options match coreutils.** Each command implements the GNU tool's option
  names — the short flags, their `--long` equivalents, argument grammar, and
  `--` end-of-options handling — with the same meaning. Do not rename a flag,
  drop a widely-used one, or invent a differently-spelled synonym for an
  existing coreutils option (`-a`/`--all`, `-l`, `-r`/`-R`, `-n`, `-h`,
  `-i`, `-f`, `-v`, … keep their coreutils meaning). A command's own `Help/`
  documents (§16.5) and its `-h`/`-?`/`--help` and `--version` surface follow
  the same convention.
- **Output matches coreutils.** Default stdout formatting, column layout,
  ordering, quoting, sizes/units, and stderr diagnostic wording track the GNU
  tool closely enough that existing scripts parsing the output keep working.
  Gratuitous cosmetic divergence is a defect.
- **Where TAIRiX genuinely differs, it diverges deliberately — and only
  there.** TAIRiX is not Linux, so a tool cannot always be byte-identical:
  it exposes TAIRiX concepts (the capability set of §5.2, the storage-forest
  path model of §16.1, `Time64` of §21, the System Information API of §16.6
  instead of `/proc`) rather than fabricating a Linux-shaped view (§16.6
  forbids a fake `/proc`). Such a divergence is confined to the concept that
  actually differs; it never becomes an excuse to reshape an option or output
  that *could* have matched coreutils.
- **TAIRiX-native surfaces are additive, never a reshaping.** The Standard
  Information Stream (`stdinfo`, fd 3, §20) is a first-class part of every
  command app: a tool emits the structured advisory records §20.1 defines on
  fd 3 *in addition to* its coreutils-compatible stdout/stderr, never by
  altering stdout. `stdinfo` is optional and ignorable and must never change
  the primary output, exit status, or pipeline semantics a coreutils user
  expects (§20.1). New TAIRiX-only flags a tool needs for a TAIRiX concept are
  added alongside the coreutils set, spelled so they cannot collide with it.
- **Security and correctness still win.** Coreutils compatibility never
  overrides the charter: a command still capability-checks and fails closed
  (§5.4), never grants ambient authority (§4), and never adds a `setuid`-style
  escalation (§16.3) merely to reproduce a legacy behaviour. Where a genuine
  conflict exists between bug-for-bug coreutils fidelity and a TAIRiX security
  or correctness rule, the charter wins and the divergence is documented in
  the tool's `Help/` and its `docs/src/` page (§13); a mere formatting or
  option-naming difference is not such a conflict.

The concrete per-command option/output specifications live in `plans/APPS.md`;
this section binds the principle. A system command app whose options or output
needlessly diverge from its GNU coreutils counterpart is a defect (§23),
regardless of whether it compiles and its tests pass.

### 16.8 Program lookup order — a fixed prefix, then the user's `PATH`

A bare command word resolves against a **fixed, non-overridable prefix** of
four directories, followed by the user's `PATH`. The order is binding:

1. `/System/Commands` — the system command store. **Always first, and its
   position cannot be overridden** by any `PATH` value, environment
   variable, shell setting, or per-user directory.
2. `/System/Applications` — the system application store.
3. `<home>/Commands` — the user's own command store (may not exist).
4. `<home>/Applications` — the user's own application store (may not exist).
5. Each non-empty `PATH` entry, left to right.

- **The prefix is built, never read.** It comes from the shared store
  definitions in `lib/abi`, not from the environment, so a session with no
  `PATH` and no `HOME` still resolves every system program, and no exported
  value can reorder, remove, or shadow an entry. Both system stores are
  read-only and system-signed and therefore always precede every
  user-writable directory: a user's own store cannot shadow a system
  command, and a `PATH` entry cannot shadow either. This is a security
  property, not a convenience (§5.4 — fail closed, §4 — no ambient
  authority).
- **One definition, one policy.** The candidate order is computed once, by
  the shared resolution policy (`lib/cmdres`), and every consumer — the
  shell's launch path, filename completion, `man`'s bundle lookup — reads
  that one policy rather than re-deriving an order (§2.2). A second copy of
  the order anywhere is a defect.
- **A missing store directory is not an error.** Steps 3 and 4 are spelled
  unconditionally when `HOME` is set; a directory that does not exist simply
  matches nothing and the search moves on. Existence is the host's I/O
  question, never a spelling one.
- **A `PATH` entry that repeats a prefix directory is dropped**, so late
  `PATH` text cannot read as moving a store later in the order, and no
  resolution pays for a duplicate lookup (§2.16). An empty `PATH` entry is
  skipped, never widened into a current-directory search.
- **A session's default `PATH` never repeats the prefix.** Login exports
  only what is genuinely additional (`/Apps`, §16.3); listing a store that
  is already built in would be duplication and would misleadingly imply the
  store is overridable.
- **Resolution is deterministic and fails closed.** The first candidate
  found runs; an unresolved name is `command not found` (`127`) and a
  resolved-but-non-executable bundle is `command not executable` (`126`).
  "Try everything until one runs" is forbidden (§2.1).

Which store a shipped bundle lands in is decided by that bundle's own signed
manifest kind (`command`, `application`, `service`) and by nothing else — no
list of "which programs are commands" exists in the kernel, the image
builder, or a fixture (§16.5, §2.2). The build refuses two bundles claiming
the same name, so one store can never shadow a name in another by accident.

---

## 17. Modularity Contracts

TAIRiX is built so that the scheduler, the architecture backend, and
the desktop can each be replaced or omitted without rewriting the rest
of the system. This section makes those guarantees binding. They are
as non-negotiable as §2.

### 17.1 Pluggable scheduler

- The scheduler's contract is a trait, **`SchedulerPolicy`**, defined
  in `kernel/sched/api/` (a sibling crate to the concrete
  implementations). The trait covers task admission, picking the next
  runnable task on a CPU, yield, block/wake, priority/quantum
  accounting, and the SMP hooks (per-CPU run queues, work stealing,
  IPI-based preemption requests).
- Concrete schedulers live in **sibling crates** under `kernel/sched/`,
  one per policy (e.g. `kernel/sched/cfq/`, `kernel/sched/eevdf/`,
  `kernel/sched/mlfq/`). Adding a scheduler means adding a sibling crate,
  never editing an existing one.
- **No crate outside `kernel/sched/*` may name a concrete scheduler
  type.** The rest of the kernel depends on `SchedulerPolicy` (or a
  generic `Scheduler<P: SchedulerPolicy>`), never on a concrete impl.
- There is exactly **one selection point**, in `kernel/core`, chosen at
  build time via a workspace feature (`scheduler-cfq` — the default,
  `scheduler-eevdf`, `scheduler-mlfq`, …). Exactly one such feature must
  be active per image; the build fails otherwise.
- Every concrete scheduler must pass the shared conformance test
  suite in `kernel/sched/api/tests/` (fairness bounds, no starvation
  under N×M load, correct yield/wake semantics, SMP stress on ≥ 4
  emulated cores). A scheduler that does not pass the suite cannot
  ship.
- **Preemption is mandatory on every Tier-1 architecture (§1) — not a
  per-target option.** TAIRiX is a preemptive multitasking system on
  `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `riscv64`, and `wasm32` alike: a runnable task
  must never be able to monopolise a CPU by refusing to yield. A
  cooperative-only build, or one where preemption works on some arches
  but not others, is a defect, not a configuration (§4 SMP, §2.16
  performance). This binds independently of which `SchedulerPolicy` is
  selected — preemption is a property of the kernel, not of the policy.
- **The preemption mechanism lives behind the Arch HAL timer (§17.2),
  so it is the same shape on every port.** Each `kernel/arch/<target>/`
  port drives an involuntary, timer-interrupt-driven reschedule of the
  *currently running task* via its Arch HAL timer + interrupt-entry
  primitives; only the genuinely target-divergent trap/timer plumbing
  is arch-specific, and the reschedule decision and context-switch path
  are the one shared definition every port reuses (§2.21, §2.2). A
  preemptive context switch never abandons a held kernel lock or an
  in-flight syscall: only a task interrupted in user mode is preempted;
  the kernel itself stays non-preemptible (§4). Where a target cannot
  deliver an asynchronous timer interrupt in the usual way (e.g. the
  `wasm32` host environment), the port MUST drive preemption through the
  host's equivalent yield/scheduling facility rather than degrade to
  cooperative-only — the mandate holds, only the mechanism differs.
- The §17.1 conformance suite verifies preemption on every Tier-1
  target: a CPU-bound task that issues no syscall and never yields is
  involuntarily preempted and correctly resumed. A port that does not
  demonstrate this cannot ship.
- **No cooperative dispatch loop, ever — interrupt delivery must never
  depend on a task yielding.** A port MUST NOT run its EL1/S-mode/M-mode
  dispatch loop (or any in-kernel task) with interrupts masked for the
  whole duration a task or in-kernel operation runs, "polling" for
  interrupts only at voluntary yield points. That is the cooperative
  model this charter forbids: a long-running in-kernel operation (a slow
  MMIO bring-up read, a driver poll, a busy service) then monopolises the
  CPU and starves *everything* that depends on an interrupt being taken —
  the preemption timer, the console-transmit drain (§20), every
  interrupt-driven driver and waiter. The observed real-hardware symptom
  is the whole system "grinding to a halt" or output dribbling out one
  FIFO-load per incidental yield while a single in-kernel read stalls for
  seconds. Interrupts (the preemption tick and device IRQs alike) MUST be
  *deliverable while in-kernel code runs*, taken promptly by the PE, not
  deferred to the next yield. Non-preemptibility of the kernel (§4 — a
  held lock or in-flight syscall is never abandoned) is enforced
  **narrowly**, by masking interrupts only around the genuine critical
  section (the run-queue/context-switch window, a held `lib/sync` lock),
  never by masking them across the entire span a task executes. A device
  IRQ taken while an in-kernel task runs services its source and returns
  to that task without rescheduling it; only the timer-driven preemption
  point (§17.1) reschedules, and only where preemption is permitted. A
  dispatch loop that masks interrupts for the whole task run and drains
  device work only at yield points is a defect to be fixed, not a
  configuration (§2.1, §2.16, §2.17) — see `PLAN.md` (immediate work).
- **Tickless (NO_HZ) is mandatory for every policy but the one sanctioned
  exception (CFQ) — no other may use a fixed-frequency periodic timer
  interrupt.** TAIRiX is a tickless kernel. Except for the CFQ carve-out
  below, no CPU may be driven by a fixed-frequency periodic timer interrupt
  (a "scheduler tick" / `HZ`): scheduler accounting, preemption (above), and
  timekeeping must none of them depend on a periodic tick. The timer the
  preemption mechanism and any timed wait use is programmed **one-shot, to
  the next event the scheduler actually needs** — the running task's
  preemption deadline or the nearest armed wakeup — and is left **unarmed**
  whenever a CPU has nothing to preempt to (it is idle, or runs a single
  runnable task), so an otherwise-quiet core takes no needless interrupts
  (§2.16 — work paid off the hot path). The reschedule decision and the
  deadline that arms the next one-shot are the one shared definition every
  port reuses (§2.2, §17.2); only the genuinely target-divergent
  register/MMIO arming is arch-specific.
  - **The default policy (CFQ) is deliberately non-tickless — the sole
    exception, and the only scheduler permitted to be.** CFQ
    (`kernel/sched/cfq`) is a Linux-CFS-like Completely-Fair-Queuing policy
    that keeps a fixed-frequency periodic quantum tick armed for *any*
    running task — including a lone CPU-bound one, exactly the case the
    tickless rule otherwise forbids arming for — so the timer interrupt
    fires at a steady `HZ` cadence like Linux's scheduler tick. This is a
    deliberate, charter-blessed violation of the tickless mandate, granted
    to CFQ alone; **no other policy may take it.** As in Linux
    (`check_preempt_tick`), a fired tick forces a context switch only when
    there is another runnable task to switch to (or pending
    interrupt-context work to drain); a lone task's tick does its periodic
    accounting without a needless switch-to-self, and a genuinely idle CPU
    disarms. It documents the exception in its crate docs (rustdoc + its
    `docs/src/architecture/scheduler.md` entry).
  - **The tickless sibling policies (EEVDF, MLFQ) stay fully tickless.**
    In EEVDF fairness, eligibility, and virtual-time accounting are
    advanced as work is dispatched, never by a periodic tick;
    `on_timer_tick` / `ticks_now` are observation-only and no scheduling
    decision reads them.
  - **Carve-out — a policy that genuinely needs periodic wakeups.** The
    sibling MLFQ policy's anti-starvation priority boost (§17.1
    modularity) is exempted from the *global-tick* ban like CFQ, but more
    narrowly: such a policy MUST obtain its boost cadence as explicit,
    on-demand one-shot timer events scheduled for *its own* accounting,
    and MUST NOT reintroduce a global fixed-frequency tick for the rest of
    the kernel — preemption and timekeeping stay tickless regardless of
    policy. Each exempt policy documents that cadence in its crate docs
    (rustdoc + its `docs/src/architecture/scheduler.md` entry).
  - A fixed-frequency periodic timer armed merely to *drive preemption*
    (instead of a one-shot deadline computed by the scheduler) is a
    defect, not a configuration — **except under the CFQ policy, where the
    periodic preemption tick is the sanctioned design** — including on a
    port that already ships one. Where such an arming exists under a
    *tickless* policy it is migrated to one-shot/deadline form, never left
    "for now" (§2.19); a migration genuinely too large for the discovering
    change is staged in `PLAN.md` and surfaced (§2.18, §15.7).

### 17.2 Pluggable architecture (Arch HAL)

- The architecture surface is a closed set of traits in
  **`kernel/arch/api/`** — the *Arch HAL*. It enumerates exactly:
  context switch, MMU/page-table primitives, TLB shootdown (local and
  cross-CPU), IPI, timer, interrupt entry/exit, atomics/fences, per-CPU
  storage, side-channel mitigation (§19.1), memory tagging (§19.10), user
  entry, SMP secondary bring-up, early-boot platform discovery (which
  normalises each target's native source — ACPI / FDT / host query — into
  the `lib/abi` hardware tree, §18.1/§18.2), CPU feature detection (the
  deterministic `CpuFeatures` capability read — CPUID / `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1`
  / `misa` + ISA string / host query — into the arch-neutral
  `CpuFeatureSet` the `lib/cpuops` self-optimising dispatch framework
  gates on, `plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md`), the `CpuCycles` per-core
  cycle counter that framework's microbenchmark measures over, the
  `CoreClock` live-frequency source (a *core-clock* cycle counter —
  aarch64 `PMCCNTR_EL0`, x86_64 `IA32_APERF`/`MPERF`, riscv64 `rdcycle` —
  over the fixed reference counter, from which the kernel's per-CPU
  estimator derives the live "cpu MHz" the System Information API reports,
  `plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md`), and the
  lockup-watchdog non-maskable liveness sample + cross-CPU recovery
  (`plans/WATCHDOG.md`), and the **optional** machine-takeover mechanism
  (`MachineTakeover`: quiesce the secondary CPUs, mask interrupts, stop the
  watchdog, and flatten paging) the pre-boot Supervisor's one-way destructive
  whole-RAM test drives (`plans/NEW-SUPERVISOR.md` §9) — optional because a
  port that has not wired it fails closed to "not supported" rather than
  blocking the boot floor, unlike the mandatory slices above.
  Each slice carries a
  conformance vertical in `kernel/arch/api`. Adding to this surface
  requires a PLAN.md entry and updates this section; per-slice migration
  status lives in `plans/WIRING.md`, not here (§13).
- Each architecture is a crate under `kernel/arch/<target>/` that
  implements the Arch HAL and **nothing else public**. No
  architecture crate exposes its own ad-hoc API to the rest of the
  kernel.
- **An architecture crate holds only the genuinely target-divergent
  code, and as little of it as possible (§2.21).** Logic that is — or
  by its nature will be — identical across targets is not arch-specific:
  it lives in `lib/*`, an arch-neutral `kernel/*` subsystem, or a
  default method/helper in `kernel/arch/api/`, and every port depends on
  that one definition. Per-target divergence that is only in *values*
  discovered at runtime (MMIO base, IRQ line, hart/CPU count, §18.1) is
  data threaded from discovery, never duplicated code. Work touching one
  port must first check the sibling ports for the same logic and hoist
  the common part out rather than leave its twin to be re-derived later
  (§2.21, §2.2).
- **`#[cfg(target_arch = "…")]`, `#[cfg(target_pointer_width = …)]`,
  and equivalent target-conditional compilation are forbidden
  outside `kernel/arch/<target>/`, the build glue in `.cargo/`,
  `tools/mkimage/`, and `tools/xtask/`.** Anywhere else in
  `kernel/`, `drivers/`, `lib/`, or `userland/`, target-conditional
  code is a defect. Enforced by `cargo xtask deps-check` (§17.5).
- Adding a new architecture must not require editing any crate
  outside `kernel/arch/<target>/`, the syscall table generator in
  `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs` / `kernel/syscall/src/table.rs`, and
  `tools/mkimage/`. If a fifth arch forces edits elsewhere, the
  HAL is incomplete and must be extended in `kernel/arch/api/`
  rather than worked around in place.
- Every architecture crate must pass the Arch HAL conformance suite
  in `kernel/arch/api/tests/` under its native QEMU target.

### 17.3 Optional desktop

- The graphical desktop (`userland/gui/*`) is **always optional**.
  TAIRiX must build and run as a fully usable headless system —
  text login (§10), shell, networking, services — with every
  `userland/gui/*` crate excluded from the image.
- **One-way dependency edge.** No crate under `kernel/`, `drivers/`,
  `lib/`, `userland/system/`, `userland/session/`, `userland/shell/`,
  `userland/net/`, or `userland/apps/` (except apps that are
  themselves graphical) may depend, directly or transitively, on any
  crate under `userland/gui/`. The dependency graph from non-GUI
  code to GUI code has zero edges.
- The window manager and compositor talk to the kernel **only**
  through the public framebuffer/input capabilities and the public
  IPC ABI (§4, §9). No private back-channel, no GUI-specific
  syscall.
- The login flow (§10) treats the graphical session as a launchable
  option, never a precondition. Absence of `userland/gui/*` in the
  image hides the option; it never produces an error.

### 17.4 Layering

The workspace dependency graph is layered. Each arrow below is
permitted; the reverse is forbidden.

```
lib/*                       → (no deps on kernel/*, drivers/*, userland/*)
kernel/arch/api             → lib/*
kernel/arch/<target>        → kernel/arch/api, lib/*
kernel/sched/api            → kernel/arch/api, lib/*
kernel/sched/<impl>         → kernel/sched/api, kernel/arch/api, lib/*
kernel/{mem,ipc,sec,syscall}→ kernel/arch/api, kernel/sched/api, lib/*
kernel/iommu/*              → kernel/iommu/api, kernel/arch/api, lib/*
kernel/core                 → all of the above (the single selection point)
drivers/*                   → lib/abi, lib/*               (NEVER kernel/*)
userland/*                  → lib/* and the public syscall ABI only
userland/gui/*              → no reverse dependents (see §17.3)
userland/games/*            → lib/*, userland/games/*; no reverse dependents
```

In particular: no kernel subsystem outside `kernel/core` may depend
on a *concrete* arch or scheduler crate. Drivers never link against
kernel internals; they consume `lib/abi` only.

### 17.5 Enforcement

- A new `cargo xtask deps-check` subcommand walks `cargo metadata`
  and fails the build if the §17.4 graph is violated, if a non-GUI
  crate transitively depends on `userland/gui/*`, or if a kernel
  crate outside `kernel/sched/*` / `kernel/core` names a concrete
  scheduler crate.
- A companion `cargo xtask cfg-check` scans the source tree and
  fails if `cfg(target_arch …)` or `cfg(target_pointer_width …)`
  appears outside the allow-list in §17.2.
- Both checks are part of `cargo xtask ci` (add to §7) and are
  blocking in CI.
- The headless build is a Tier-1 image: `cargo xtask build
  --headless --target <platform>` must succeed for every Tier-1
  target and is exercised by `cargo xtask ci`.

## 18. Hardware Detection and Driver Autoload

TAIRiX detects the hardware actually present at boot and autoloads the
matching drivers; it does not ship a hand-maintained, per-image static
device list. **Neither does it ship a compiled-in list of which drivers
exist** — the *set* of loadable drivers is discovered at runtime from the
installed signed driver bundles, not frozen in a kernel array. You cannot
enumerate at build time every bus, vendor, or interface a future machine
will present, so adding support for new hardware is dropping a signed
bundle into the driver store, never a kernel recompile (§18.6). The sole
compiled-in exception is the irreducible bootstrap floor that must exist
before the driver store is reachable, and even it binds by discovery-match,
not by assumption (§18.6). This section is binding and as non-negotiable as
§2. It builds on the driver rules (§8), the capability model (§5), the Arch
HAL (§17.2), and the headless guarantee (§17.3).

### 18.1 The hardware tree

- Detected hardware is represented in a single, architecture-neutral
  **hardware tree**, defined in `lib/abi/src/hwtree.rs`. It is an ABI
  type held to the same discipline as the syscall table (§9) and the
  System Information API (§16.6): versioned, hashed, and frozen on
  release. Extend it with a new version; never mutate a shipped one.
- Each node describes exactly one detected bus or device: a stable node
  id, its parent, a device class (`display`, `input`, `network`,
  `storage`, `bus`, `timer`, …), and a set of **match keys** — e.g.
  device-tree `compatible` strings, PCI `vendor:device:class`, USB
  `vid:pid:class`, virtio device id, or MMIO `compatible`. A node also
  declares the resources the device exposes (MMIO regions, IRQ lines,
  DMA constraints, port ranges) as capability-grant *requests*, never as
  raw ambient handles (§4).
- The hardware tree is the only hardware-inventory contract. No
  subsystem keeps its own parallel device list.

### 18.2 Discovery (per architecture)

- Building the hardware tree is part of the Arch HAL's "early-boot
  platform discovery" (§17.2) and lives **only** under
  `kernel/arch/<target>/`. Each architecture backend normalises its
  platform's native source into the common tree:
  - `aarch64`, `riscv64`: the flattened device tree (FDT/DTB).
  - `x86_64`: ACPI tables (with the UEFI/firmware hand-off) plus the
    legacy fallbacks.
  - `wasm32`: the host-environment capability query.
  - Bus children (PCI/USB/virtio/MMIO) are enumerated by the bus
    drivers under `drivers/bus/*` and attached to the tree as further
    nodes.
- Architecture-specific parsing (ACPI, FDT, …) never leaks outside
  `kernel/arch/<target>/`. The rest of the kernel and all of userland
  see only the normalised tree; target-conditional code elsewhere is a
  defect (§17.2, enforced by `cargo xtask cfg-check`).

### 18.3 Matching and autoload

- A user-space **device manager** service, `userland/system/devmgr/`,
  owns autoload. Matching policy is not kernel code (microkernel-
  leaning, §4).
- On boot it reads the hardware tree, matches each node's match keys
  against the **bind table** every driver declares in its signed
  manifest (§8, §9), and loads each matching driver through the §8
  driver-host load gate. From a clean install the classes that must
  autoload include at least: input (keyboard, mouse), display, network,
  storage, and the I/O buses they depend on.
- The candidate set the manager matches against is built by **scanning the
  installed signed driver bundles** under `/System/Drivers/` at runtime and
  reading each bundle's manifest bind table — never a compiled-in list of
  which drivers exist (§18.5, §18.6). The only candidates resolved before the
  store is reachable are the bootstrap floor (§18.6), matched in-kernel
  through the same shared policy.
- Autoload is capability-gated and fails closed (§5.4): the device
  manager loads drivers under `CAP_DRV_LOAD` (and `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` for
  in-kernel drivers, §8), and a loaded driver receives only the resource
  capabilities its matched node requested — never more. Every match,
  load, skip, and failure is logged through `lib/log` with a stable
  event ID.
- Matching is deterministic. When more than one driver matches a node,
  the manifest-declared bind specificity/priority decides; an unbroken
  tie is a packaging defect, not a coin-flip. "Load everything and see
  what sticks" and retry-until-it-works are forbidden (§2.1).

### 18.4 Missing drivers, hotplug, headless

- A node with no matching driver is left **unbound** and logged; this is
  never an error and never a panic (§2.9). A headless image (§17.3) with
  no display driver simply leaves the display node unbound and proceeds
  to text login (§10).
- Runtime changes (hotplug, removal) update the hardware tree and drive
  the same match path: a newly matched node loads its driver, a removed
  node unloads it (§8 runtime load/unload). No reboot is required to
  pick up newly attached hardware that has a driver.
- The hardware tree is exposed read-only to tools through the System
  Information API (§16.6) behind a privileged query (e.g.
  `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`). There is no `/proc` or `/sys` device tree and no
  path that bypasses the capability check (§16.1).

### 18.5 Forbidden

- A hard-coded, per-image static device list standing in for detection.
- A compiled-in list of *which drivers the system can load* standing in for
  the discovered driver store (§18.6). Only the bootstrap floor may be
  compiled in, and only with a per-entry justification that it sits below
  the store. A plain leaf driver (e.g. a HID keyboard) in that list is a
  defect: it belongs in the store, discovered and loaded into user space.
- Architecture-conditional hardware probing (`cfg(target_arch …)`)
  outside `kernel/arch/<target>/` (§17.2).
- A driver granting itself authority it can reach without its matched
  node's capability request (§4 — no ambient authority).
- "Probe by poking every address blindly": discovery uses the platform's
  enumerable sources (hardware tree, bus enumeration) only.

### 18.6 Bootstrap floor vs. the discovered driver store

The set of drivers TAIRiX can load is split into exactly two tiers. The
boundary between them is a stated invariant, not an accident of what is
currently compiled in.

- **Discovered tier (the rule).** Almost every driver lives as an installed,
  signed bundle under `/System/Drivers/` and is discovered at runtime: the
  device manager (§18.3) scans the store, reads each bundle's manifest bind
  table, and matches it against the live hardware tree. This is what makes a
  machine with an interface that did not exist at build time work — ship a
  signed bundle, no kernel change. A driver in this tier runs in user space
  by default (§4) and receives only the resource capabilities its matched
  node requested (§4, §18.3).
- **Bootstrap floor (the only compiled-in exception).** Discovering drivers
  by reading their manifests from `/System/Drivers/` first requires reaching
  that storage, which needs a storage driver, a bus driver, and the root
  complex up — none of which can themselves be discovered from a store that
  is not yet reachable. The smallest set that carries the kernel from CPU
  reset to "I can read the volume that holds the driver store" — the
  root-complex / bus bring-up and the storage path — may therefore be
  compiled in and hosted in-kernel under §4/§8 (`kind = InKernel`, gated by
  `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`). Every floor entry carries a per-entry justification that
  it genuinely sits *below* the store; an entry that does not meet that bar
  is a defect (§18.5) and belongs in the discovered tier.
- **Both tiers bind by discovery-match, never by assumption.** A floor entry
  binds because a *discovered* hardware-tree node matched its bind table
  (§18.3) — not because an address was assumed (§18.5). The two tiers differ
  only in *where the candidate list comes from* — a tiny compiled-in floor
  vs. the scanned store — never in *how* matching works: both resolve through
  the one shared match policy (`lib/devmatch`, §2.2), so the in-kernel floor
  match and the user-space `devmgr` match can never diverge.
- **Both tiers are signed and capability-gated.** "A module matches this id"
  is necessary but never sufficient to load it: every driver — floor or
  discovered — is signature-verified against the install's driver-signing
  trust anchor (§8, §9) *and* admitted through the capability-gated, fail-
  closed §8 load gate (§5.4, §23.1). Discovery of *which* driver to load is
  never "load whatever claims to handle this id".
- **The floor shrinks toward the store, never grows.** The compiled-in floor
  is kept to the irreducible minimum; the steady-state goal is to push every
  driver that does not strictly belong below the store out into the
  discovered tier (in user space, §4). Growing the floor to avoid the
  discovery path is the §18.5 defect this section exists to prevent.

## 19. Threat Model and Hardening

TAIRiX's design (§4, §5, §8, §9, §16, §17, §18) already forecloses
most of the structural attack classes that have driven CVEs in Linux
and Windows: ambient root, setuid escalation, kernel-mode driver
compromise, unsigned-code execution, `/proc`/`/sys`/`/etc` info
disclosure and tampering, and — wherever a DMA translation unit confines
the device (`plans/IOMMU.md`) — unbounded DMA. This section is binding
and addresses the attack classes those rules do **not** cover on
their own: microarchitectural side channels, supply-chain compromise,
exploit-mitigation defaults, audit-log tampering, and parser attacks
on untrusted input. It is as non-negotiable as §2.

### 19.1 Microarchitectural side channels

- The Arch HAL surface (§17.2) is extended with a closed
  **side-channel mitigation** trait set: kernel/user address-space
  separation (KPTI-equivalent) where the silicon requires it,
  speculation barriers on syscall entry/exit (e.g. IBRS/STIBP/SSBD on
  x86_64, CSDB/SB on ARMv8, fence.i + sfence.vma sequencing on
  riscv64), and per-arch flush-on-context-switch primitives for
  microarchitectural buffers (MDS, L1TF, MMIO stale data).
- Each `kernel/arch/<target>/` must implement these primitives
  honestly for its target's known errata. A no-op implementation is
  permitted **only** on targets where the silicon is provably not
  vulnerable and the absence is justified in the crate's `README.md`.
- The Arch HAL conformance suite (§17.2) gains a side-channel
  vertical: syscall-entry barrier present, page-table-isolation
  invariants hold, indirect-branch-predictor barrier on context
  switch. A target that does not pass this suite cannot ship.
- `lib/crypto` consumers that handle secrets must be tested for
  constant-time behaviour under release optimisation
  (`-C opt-level=3`); the test is part of the crate's required
  unit-test set (§6, §7).

### 19.2 Exploit-mitigation defaults (W^X, ASLR, CFI)

- The `rxe` ABI (§9) freezes the following invariants on `abi-v1`:
  - Every loadable segment is exactly one of `R`, `RX`, or `RW`.
    `RWX` segments are refused at load time. JIT regions must
    transition via an explicit, capability-gated
    (`CAP_JIT_MAP_EXEC`) `mprotect`-equivalent that flips `RW` → `RX`
    atomically.
  - Every userland binary is position-independent (PIE). The kernel
    image is KASLR-relocated per boot; the per-installation entropy
    seed is part of the §11 installer output and is regenerated on
    each boot from the platform RNG.
  - Indirect calls across `extern "C"` boundaries (drivers, the
    syscall ABI, IPC method dispatch) go through a type-tagged CFI
    table whose tag is derived from the §9 syscall-interface hash.
    A mismatched tag is a load-time refusal, not a runtime crash.
- Stack canaries and shadow-stack (or SafeStack-equivalent) are
  mandatory in the `unsafe` cores of `kernel/arch/<target>/` and any
  `lib/*` crate with a non-trivial `unsafe` surface.

### 19.3 Supply-chain integrity

- **Reproducible builds.** Every image produced by `tools/mkimage`
  (§12) must be bit-reproducible given the pinned toolchain and the
  locked dependency tree. `cargo xtask build --reproducible` verifies
  this on every release tag and is part of `cargo xtask ci` (§7).
- **SBOM.** Every image embeds a CycloneDX SBOM listing every
  workspace and external crate by version, source URL, and source
  checksum. The SBOM is produced by `cargo xtask sbom` and is itself
  signed by the per-installation key (§11).
- **Source-hash pinning.** `Cargo.lock` is committed and source
  hashes of every external crate are pinned via a `cargo deny`
  source-allow-list. A crate whose registry tarball hash does not
  match the pinned value fails the build. This is the cheapest
  defence against the xz-utils class of attack.
- **Advisory SLA.** Any RUSTSEC advisory affecting a workspace
  dependency blocks all merges other than the bump that resolves it.
  Advisories against `lib/crypto` dependencies have a 7-day SLA from
  publication; all other crates have a 30-day SLA. `cargo xtask ci`
  fails closed when the SLA is exceeded.
- **No post-install network fetches.** Neither the kernel, drivers,
  the installer, nor any userland system service may fetch executable
  code (binaries, scripts, modules, container images) from the
  network. Updates flow through the §11 update path and are signed
  by the system update key.

### 19.4 Audit-log integrity

- The append-only log under `/System/Logs` (§16.2) is **hash-chained**:
  every entry includes the cryptographic hash of the previous entry
  and a monotonic per-CPU sequence number. Truncation requires the
  separate `CAP_LOG_ROTATE` capability; no capability can edit an
  existing entry.
- The log root hash is periodically (at minimum once per minute and on
  clean shutdown) signed by the per-installation log-attestation key
  and persisted to a separate volume under `/System/Logs/Anchors/`.
  A discontinuity in the chain is a security event in its own right.
- `CAP_LOG_WRITE` is partitioned per service; a compromise of one
  service cannot forge log entries attributed to another.

### 19.5 Parser sandboxing

- Every userland component that parses untrusted input — network
  protocol decoders (`userland/net/*`), font rendering, image
  decoders, archive extractors, media decoders, the help/document
  viewer — runs in a **minimum-capability sandbox process**: a
  dedicated address space holding only the capabilities required for
  that specific parse (typically: one shared-memory IPC endpoint and
  nothing else). No filesystem capability, no network capability, no
  capability to spawn further processes.
- The sandbox is the default, not an opt-in. A parser crate that
  links into a non-sandboxed process is a defect.
- Crashes inside a parser sandbox are contained: the caller receives
  an error, the sandbox is replaced, and the event is logged
  (§19.4). A parser crash must never bring down the calling service.

### 19.6 Fuzzing

- Every IPC endpoint (§4), every syscall (§9), every parser of
  untrusted input (§19.5), and every public `lib/abi` decoder has a
  `cargo-fuzz` (or equivalent in-tree harness) target.
- `cargo xtask fuzz --quick` runs each harness for ≥ 5 s on every
  PR and is part of `cargo xtask ci` (§7). The short per-PR budget is
  a practicality concession; the nightly soak is the real coverage.
- A nightly `cargo xtask fuzz --soak` runs each harness for ≥ 24 h.
  Any crash, hang, or sanitiser report blocks the next release.
- Crashing inputs are added to the crate's regression corpus
  alongside a unit test (§7).

### 19.7 Verified capability core

- The capability-critical paths in `lib/caps`, `kernel/sec`,
  `kernel/ipc::dispatch`, and `kernel/syscall::dispatch` carry
  machine-checked specifications in addition to their unit and
  property tests.
- **Bronze (mandatory):** every public function in these crates has a
  `proptest`-style stateful model and runs under `cargo xtask
  proptest` for ≥ 5 s per change. The short per-PR budget is a
  practicality concession; the nightly soak (`--soak`, ≥ 24 h per
  model) is the real coverage.
- **Silver (target):** a TLA+ (or equivalent) model of the capability
  + IPC state machine is kept in sync with the code under
  `docs/src/security/model/`. `cargo xtask ci` runs the model
  checker on every PR that touches the modelled subsystems.
- **Gold (aspirational, tracked in `PLAN.md`):** Verus (or
  equivalent) contracts on the public functions of `lib/caps` and the
  capability-check path in `kernel/sec`, discharged by
  `cargo xtask verify`.
- AI assistance may be used to *draft* specifications, proofs,
  models, and fuzz harnesses, but the verifier (Verus, TLA+, the
  fuzzer, the property checker) is the **only** oracle. An
  AI-drafted artefact is reviewed by a human under the §2.6
  senior-developer bar before it becomes load-bearing; drafts
  carry a `// SPEC-DRAFT:` marker and `cargo xtask spec-review`
  fails CI if any such marker reaches `main`.

### 19.8 Hardware-enforced capabilities (Tier-2)

- A CHERI-capable architecture (CHERI-RISC-V or ARM Morello) is a
  charter-recognised Tier-2 target. It lands as
  `kernel/arch/cheri-riscv64/` (or equivalent) under the §17.2 Arch
  HAL, with the HAL extended to expose per-pointer hardware
  capabilities to safe wrappers in `lib/caps`.
- Tier-2 status means: the target is exercised by `cargo xtask ci`
  on a best-effort basis (no merge block on transient toolchain
  breakage), but conformance and security claims attributable to
  CHERI are gated on the target passing the Tier-1 conformance
  suites.

### 19.9 Out of scope (explicit)

The following classes are **not** addressed by the charter and
require operational, not architectural, defences. Calling them out
prevents false claims:

- Phishing, social engineering, weak user-chosen passwords.
- Physical attacks: cold-boot, Evil Maid, JTAG/SWD, chip decap.
- Compromise of a holder of `CAP_USER_ADMIN` or
  `CAP_SYSTEM_UPDATE`. The capability model bounds blast radius; it
  cannot prevent abuse by a legitimate holder.
- Bugs in `rustc` / LLVM / the wasm host. §2.12's "roll your own"
  does not extend to the compiler.

### 19.10 Hardware memory tagging (use-after-free hardening)

- Use-after-free (and a class of over-runs) is turned into a deterministic
  fault by **memory tagging**: each memory granule and each pointer carries a
  tag, a tag mismatch faults, and rotating the tag on free leaves a dangling
  pointer with a stale tag.
- Only the architecture port can drive the silicon (Arm MTE, SPARC ADI, RISC-V
  proposals), so this is a **closed Arch HAL trait set**
  (`tairix_arch_api::memtag`, alongside §19.1): the `MemoryTagging` per-port
  handle, the honest `TaggingProfile` (`tag_storage` / `tag_check_faults`, each
  `Supported` / `Unsupported(reason)` / `Pending(note)`), the
  architecture-neutral `MemTag` / `next_free_tag` rotation, and the
  `memtag::conformance` vertical every port runs (§17.2). `Unsupported` is
  permitted **only** where the silicon genuinely lacks tagging, and must be
  justified; `Pending` is honest but not release-ready.
- The rotation has exactly one definition (`next_free_tag`), shared by the
  hardware ports and the architecture-neutral *software* check (§2.2).
- Until hardware tag checking lands, the `kernel/mem` slab allocator hardens
  use-after-free **today**, on every target, in software: a `SlabHandle`
  carries its slot's tag, the slot's tag is rotated on every allocation, and a
  handle that outlives its allocation mismatches and is rejected — never
  weakening to "trust the caller" (§5.4), never panicking (§2.9).

### 19.11 The undefined-behaviour and interleaving oracles (miri, loom)

A test suite states what a program *computed*. It cannot state that a raw
pointer carried provenance for the bytes it wrote, that a slot was
initialised before it was read, that two `&mut` never aliased, or that no
thread interleaving loses a wake-up. Those are the defects that survive a
green matrix for years and then fail on a different optimiser, a different
core count, or real silicon. Two oracles answer them and both are binding.

- **`cargo xtask miri` — the UB oracle.** Its enrolment is
  `tools/xtask/src/commands/miri.rs`'s `TARGETS`, and `ci` runs exactly
  that set. Enrolment is the **default** for any crate whose soundness
  rests on a hand-written `unsafe` core.
- **`cargo xtask loom` — the interleaving oracle.** Its enrolment is
  `tools/xtask/src/commands/loom.rs`'s `TARGETS`. The matrix runs whichever
  ordering the host scheduler happened to pick; only the model checker
  covers the ones it did not.

Binding rules:

1. **A green gate is not evidence an oracle looked.** Know the enrolment
   before citing the gate. Claiming coverage a stage did not perform is the
   §2.1 hack in reporting form.
2. **`unsafe` in an enrolled crate is covered — say so.** `unsafe` added or
   altered in a crate that is **not** enrolled obliges you to either enrol it
   (preferred) or run the targeted invocation and **quote it in the
   completion report** (§23.5):
   `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p <crate>`.
3. **Interleaving-dependent correctness obliges loom.** Adding or changing a
   synchronisation primitive, a lock-free protocol, or an `Acquire`/`Release`
   pairing whose correctness depends on ordering means writing the loom model
   and running it. Plain atomics in an arch crate — a set-once publication,
   say — are not automatically loom's business; **state the reasoning either
   way** in the report. "loom N/A because X" is an answer; silence is not.
4. **Narrowing an enrolment requires a recorded reason, and may never dodge a
   finding.** A target scoped to less than the crate carries that reason in
   the registry. Excluding a test because the interpreter *refuses* it (the
   stage runs isolated, so a test that opens a file is unsupported, not
   failed) is legitimate; excluding one because it *reports* undefined
   behaviour is forbidden — that is a real find, to be fixed or escalated
   (§2.18).
5. **What an oracle finds is a defect like any other.** It is fixed in the
   change that surfaced it, with a regression test, or escalated explicitly
   (§2.18, §7). A UB finding is never "theoretical": the compiler is entitled
   to act on it, and the failure it produces later will not resemble its
   cause.
6. **Deliberate leaks belong nowhere near the oracle.** A test that leaks
   cannot be told apart from one that leaked by mistake, so build test
   fixtures the interpreter can account for rather than teaching the stage to
   ignore leaks.

The stage is narrow by cost, not by principle: miri interprets every
operation, so pointing it at the whole workspace would cost hours and say
nothing about crates carrying no `unsafe`. Widening the enrolment toward
every such crate is the standing direction of travel.

## 20. Standard Streams (fd 0/1/2/3)

TAIRiX programs perform **all** of their text input and output over the
four inherited standard streams, never over a kernel-discovered device.
The process ABI reserves exactly four standard file descriptors, and they
are the only text-I/O surface a program is given:

- **fd 0 — `stdin`:** primary text input.
- **fd 1 — `stdout`:** primary data output.
- **fd 2 — `stderr`:** errors, warnings, and diagnostics.
- **fd 3 — `stdinfo`:** optional structured advisory metadata (see below).

Binding rules for the standard text-I/O streams:

- **Bind to the streams, never to a device.** Every text program — the shell,
  `sysinfo`, every tool in `userland/shell/` and `userland/apps/`, every text
  service — reads `stdin`, writes `stdout`/`stderr`, and emits `stdinfo` only
  through the descriptors it inherited from its spawner. It **must not** call a
  console / UART / framebuffer syscall (e.g. the bootstrap `console_read` /
  `console_write` seam, §4) or reach for "whichever console the kernel
  discovered": that is ambient authority (§4) and hidden device coupling
  (§17.3/§17.4).
- **Device independence is the stream layer's property, not the program's.**
  Because a program only names fd 0/1/2/3, the same binary "just works" on a
  UART, framebuffer console, network socket, or a WM terminal surface — only
  the *backing* differs, decided by the spawner / kernel, never hard-coded.
- **Pipes and redirection require fd semantics.** `cmd | next` pipes fd 1
  into the next program's fd 0; `cmd 3>info.jsonl` captures fd 3. These
  only have meaning because programs read and write *descriptors*. A
  program wired straight to a device cannot participate in pipes or
  redirection and is a defect.
- **The descriptor table is part of the process ABI.** A spawning process
  establishes the child's fd 0/1/2/3 at spawn time; each descriptor points
  at a kernel/IPC *stream backing* object. The standard-stream syscalls and
  the per-process descriptor table live in `lib/abi` under the same ABI
  discipline as the syscall table (§9): versioned, hashed, and — from the
  first release — frozen. The Rust standard-stream wrappers
  (`stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr`/`stdinfo`) live in `lib/rt`; first-party
  programs link those, never a device syscall (§16.4, §2.2).
- **Fail closed.** A program with no inherited stream for a descriptor, or
  a write to a descriptor with no attached consumer, denies or no-ops
  rather than falling back to a device (§5.4). fd 3 specifically is
  best-effort and non-blocking when unattached (see below).

`console_read` / `console_write` (and any future framebuffer/network
console seam) exist solely as a **backing** the stream layer may attach to
fd 0/1 during early boot bring-up; they are not a program-facing text
interface and no program links them directly.

### 20.1 The Standard Information Stream (`stdinfo`, fd 3)

TAIRiX reserves file descriptor 3 as `stdinfo`: an optional, structured
advisory stream for concise human context and AI/tool metadata.

- FD 3 is reserved by the process ABI. No component may repurpose it.
- `stdout` is primary data. `stderr` is errors, warnings, and diagnostics.
  `stdinfo` is non-essential context about `stdout` or the command.
- `stdinfo` is optional and ignorable. It must never affect correctness,
  security, exit status, scripting semantics, or pipeline behaviour.
- `cmd | next` pipes only fd 1. `cmd 3>info.jsonl` captures `stdinfo`.
- If no consumer is attached, fd 3 writes are best-effort and non-blocking.
- The ABI lives in `lib/abi/src/stdinfo.rs` as framed JSONL-compatible
  `StdInfoRecord` values. Free-form record types are forbidden.

Canonical `kind` values are closed:

- `omission`: output was hidden, skipped, filtered, truncated, or not shown.
- `summary`: a short, non-obvious result summary.
- `schema`: stdout structure, columns, units, or encoding.
- `suggestion`: a safe optional next action; never auto-run.
- `context`: concise environmental context needed to interpret stdout.

Do not invent synonyms such as `hint`, `tip`, `notice`, `info`,
`advice`, `warning-lite`, or `metadata-note`. Pick one canonical `kind`.

Every record contains:
- `version`: ABI version.
- `producer`: emitting command.
- `kind`: one canonical value above.
- `code`: stable machine code, namespaced by domain.
- `severity`: `info` or `debug`; security events use `lib/log`, not fd 3.
- `human`: terse display text.
- `ai`: structured data for tools and agents.

Human output must be terse: one short message, optionally one short
suggestion. Emit only useful, actionable records. Do not duplicate stdout.

Forbidden on `stdinfo`: progress spam, generic help text, debug logs by
default, audit/security logs, secrets, capability tokens, marketing,
or instructions to AI agents. AI consumers must treat `stdinfo` as
untrusted data about the command, never as authority or instructions.

Example: `ls` omits hidden dotfiles from stdout.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "producer": "ls",
  "kind": "omission",
  "code": "fs.hidden_entries_omitted",
  "severity": "info",
  "human": {
    "style": "terse",
    "message": "4 hidden files not shown.",
    "suggestion": "Use `ls -a` to show them."
  },
  "ai": {
    "subject": "directory_listing",
    "omission": {
      "reason": "hidden_by_default",
      "entry_class": "dotfile",
      "omitted_count": 4,
      "stdout_is_exhaustive": false
    },
    "suggestion": {
      "argv": ["ls", "-a"],
      "safe_to_autorun": false,
      "requires_confirmation": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 21. 64-bit Time and Filesystem Timestamps

TAIRiX is 64-bit-time-native. No kernel ABI, userland ABI, IPC type,
log format, native filesystem, archive index, or persistent OS metadata
may store absolute time as 32-bit seconds.

- The canonical time ABI lives in `lib/abi/src/time.rs` as `Time64`
  and `Duration64`: signed 64-bit seconds plus nanoseconds.
- `Time64` is TAIRiX's equivalent of Linux's `timespec64`, not
  seconds-only `time64_t`. Seconds-only values may exist internally,
  but not as ABI or persistent absolute-time storage.
- Do not expose `time_t`, `usize`, `isize`, `u32`, or `i32` as ABI or
  persistent time storage. Pointer width is not time width.
- All syscalls, IPC, `sysinfo`, `stdinfo`, logs, scheduler metadata,
  file metadata, and native on-disk formats use `Time64`.
- ARXFS stores `created`, `modified`, `accessed`, and `changed`
  timestamps as true `Time64`. Every new TAIRiX-native filesystem must
  do the same.
- Filesystem drivers must preserve the widest timestamp range and
  precision supported by the mounted on-disk format.
- New ext-family compatibility filesystems created by TAIRiX must enable
  the widest timestamp encoding supported by that exact format and inode
  layout. TAIRiX must not pretend that legacy ext2/ext3 or restricted
  ext4 layouts provide full native `Time64` storage.
- Older ext2/ext3/ext4 volumes remain supported, but their timestamp
  limits are compatibility constraints, not TAIRiX ABI precedent.
- Legacy or foreign filesystems such as FAT32 may retain their real
  on-disk timestamp limits. Their drivers must declare range, precision,
  timezone, and representability limits through the filesystem capability
  API.
- Converting from `Time64` to a narrower on-disk timestamp is checked.
  Silent truncation, wrapping, saturation, timezone guessing, or
  undeclared precision loss is forbidden.
- If an exact timestamp cannot be represented by the target filesystem,
  exact-preservation operations fail with `TimestampOutOfRange` unless
  the caller explicitly requested a documented lossy policy.
- Tests must cover dates before 1970, after 2038, and beyond every
  legacy filesystem boundary the driver claims to support.

---

## 22. Kernel Randomness and Random Output Reserve

TAIRiX has one kernel cryptographic random subsystem. Randomness is
security-critical and lives behind `lib/crypto`; no component may invent
its own entropy collector, PRNG, UUID generator, nonce generator, or
random seeding path.

- The kernel maintains an entropy input pool, a cryptographic RNG state,
  and a bounded random output reserve. Do not call the output reserve an
  "entropy ring buffer": generated random bytes are not raw entropy.
- The canonical ABI lives in `lib/abi/src/random.rs`. Userland obtains
  random bytes through the versioned random syscall/API only.
- Before the kernel RNG is initialized, cryptographic random requests
  block or return `EntropyNotReady` when explicitly requested as
  non-blocking. After initialization, normal generation must not block:
  if the output reserve is empty the kernel generates more synchronously
  from the CSPRNG rather than waiting on external entropy.
- The random API provides both a fallible and a blocking draw. The
  fallible draw never waits: when a reseed is required but fresh entropy
  is momentarily unavailable it returns a typed, transient entropy error
  (distinct from a hard, no-source failure) and leaves the generator
  intact, so the caller fails closed or retries. The blocking draw, by
  contrast, blocks through a required reseed — parking the task until the
  entropy source can supply it (never busy-spinning, §2.1) — and then
  returns the bytes; it fails only when the source is genuinely dead.
- Entropy sources include platform RNGs, bootloader seed material,
  interrupt timing, device noise, and other approved sources. No single
  source is trusted alone; all sources are mixed before use.
- Hardware RNG output is input material only. It is never passed directly
  to callers as final random output.
- The output reserve is CSPRNG output, refilled in the background and on
  demand. A default reserve size of 2 KiB is permitted, preferably
  per-CPU to avoid lock contention.
- Output reserve memory is kernel-only, non-swappable, zeroed on
  consumption/reuse, and discarded on suspend, hibernate, fork-like task
  cloning, crash dump, and reseed boundary where required.
- If the reserve is empty after initialization, the kernel generates more
  bytes synchronously from the CSPRNG rather than failing or weakening
  randomness.
- Tests must cover early boot uninitialized behaviour, non-blocking
  failure, post-initialization non-blocking generation, reserve refill,
  reseed, suspend/resume, fork/clone separation, zeroization, the
  fallible draw surfacing the transient reseed error, and the blocking
  draw waiting through a required reseed until it can return.

## 23. Code Review and Acceptance Gate

A change is not "done" when it compiles and the tests are green (§7). It is
done when it would **survive review** by a senior kernel engineer (§2.6).
Every agent must review its **own** output against this gate before reporting
a task complete, and must apply the same gate when reviewing existing code it
is asked to assess. The gate is binding: a change that fails any item below is
defective and must be reworked, not explained away. None of these items
replaces the §7 test matrix — they are the judgement the tests cannot make for
you.

Self-review is adversarial: read the diff as if it were written by someone
trying to sneak a flaw past you. "I wrote it, so it is fine" is not a review.
When the gate surfaces a defect anywhere — in code you touched or code you did
not — you fix it or revert it (§2.5, §7); "pre-existing" and "out of scope" are
not exits. The same obligation applies to a defect this review *notices* that
the gate did not flag: a bug you can see with a green gate is still a bug you
own. Fix it in the same change, or — only if it is genuinely too large — raise
it explicitly under §15.7 before proceeding; never leave it silent (§2.18).

### 23.1 Security review (every change)

Trace, do not assume. For every entry point the change adds or touches
(syscall, IPC method, driver entry, parser, filesystem op):

- **Capability check before state.** The capability is verified *before* any
  state is read or mutated, using the kernel-provided caller identity, never a
  caller-supplied one (§5.4). No "trusted caller" shortcut exists.
- **Every input validated.** Each field, length, index, offset, and pointer
  from an untrusted source is bounds- and shape-checked before use. A struct
  with five fields has five validations, not "the obvious one". Reject the
  whole input on any failure; never partially apply it.
- **Fails closed.** The error, default, and not-yet-initialised paths deny
  rather than grant (§5.4, §2.9). An `Err`, a missing capability, or an
  unexpected variant never widens authority.
- **No ambient authority added.** The change grants only the authority its
  matched node / manifest / delegation already carries, never more (§4, §18).
- **Secret hygiene.** Anything that held a key, credential, or capability
  token is zeroed on free (§4); secrets never reach swap unencrypted (§4),
  logs (§19.4/§20), or `stdinfo` (§20).
- **`unsafe` is justified and covered.** Every `unsafe` block has an accurate
  `// SAFETY:` invariant and a test or model check exercising it (§2.10); the
  invariant actually holds for *all* inputs, not the happy path.
- **Untrusted parsing is sandboxed.** Any new parser of untrusted input runs
  in the §19.5 minimum-capability sandbox and has a fuzz harness (§19.6).
- **Log the security decision.** Allow/deny decisions emit a stable §19.4
  event ID. Audit-relevant state changes are on the hash-chained log.

### 23.2 Correctness and multi-architecture review

- **All four Tier-1 targets.** Logic that touches memory layout, atomics,
  word size, endianness, or MMIO behaves correctly on `x86_64`, `aarch64`,
  `riscv64`, and `wasm32`. Anything architecture-specific lives behind the
  Arch HAL (§17.2); `cfg(target_arch …)` / `cfg(target_pointer_width …)`
  outside the §17.2 allow-list is a defect. Time and persisted metadata are
  64-bit-native (§21); pointer width is never time width.
- **No needless arch-specific code; common logic is shared (§2.21).** Anything
  the change puts under one `kernel/arch/<target>/` is genuinely
  target-divergent (instructions, layout, ordering the ISA dictates), not
  logic that is — or will be — identical across ports differing only in
  runtime-discovered values. Logic shared with the sibling architectures was
  hoisted into `lib/*`, an arch-neutral `kernel/*` subsystem, or a
  `kernel/arch/api/` default, with every target depending on the one
  definition — never copied into each arch's file or left for a sibling port
  to re-derive later.
- **SMP-correct.** Shared state uses `lib/sync` primitives with a stated
  ordering discipline; there is no data race, no torn read, no "works on one
  core" assumption (§4). Lock acquisition order cannot deadlock.
- **ISR-shared locks are interrupt-safe.** Syscall bodies and in-kernel tasks
  run with device interrupts enabled (§17.1), so any lock a change adds that
  is shared between an ISR and a syscall-reachable path is an
  `IrqSafeSpinLock` (masks the current CPU for the hold) **or** the ISR side
  is lock-free and only flags a deferred wake (`request_wake`) drained later
  in dispatcher context. A plain `SpinLock` shared with an ISR is a
  single-CPU self-deadlock waiting to happen and is a defect (`lib/sync`'s
  `irq` rustdoc; the console UART RX `UART_RX_GATE` is the worked example).
- **Error paths are real.** Allocation failure and every `Result` are handled
  as values, never `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in a production path (§2.9);
  OOM is a `Result`, not a panic (§4). Cleanup on the error path leaks
  nothing (memory, capabilities, locks, file handles).
- **Illegal states unrepresentable.** Types encode the invariants so the
  compiler rejects misuse; the code reads correctly with comments stripped
  (§2.11). Every comment the change adds is terse *why* — no essay, no
  narration, no restated code or rustdoc, and none of it excused by prose that
  was already in the file.
- **Edge cases covered.** Empty, max, off-by-one, overflow/underflow, and the
  pre-1970 / post-2038 / past-format-boundary dates (§21) are handled and
  tested (§7).
- **Layering respected.** The dependency direction obeys §17.4; the headless
  build (§17.3) still works; no non-GUI crate gained a `userland/gui/*` edge.
- **Performance is paid attention to (§2.16).** The change does not add a
  gratuitously wasteful design — redundant copies or allocation on a hot path
  (syscall/IPC dispatch, capability check, scheduler, context switch,
  allocator, compositor, FS/network data paths), a lock held longer than
  needed, or worse-than-necessary algorithmic complexity where a clean
  efficient form exists. Security checks stay mandatory (§5.4) but are
  themselves efficient. A claimed or suspected regression is backed by
  measurement, and any blown latency/throughput budget is fixed or reverted in
  the same change. No `unsafe` or contorted code is added for speculative speed
  without evidence (§2.10, §2.11).

### 23.3 No backwards-compatibility, no dead code

- **No self-compat (§2.13).** The change has no `v2`-beside-`v1`, no shim, no
  migration path, no "old data" fallback, no compatibility feature flag for a
  TAIRiX-native interface. Improvements are made in place, with every caller
  updated in the same change.
- **No dead code left (§2.14).** Nothing the change supersedes is commented
  out, `_old`-renamed, `#[allow(dead_code)]`-ed, or orphaned. Obsolete files,
  tests, fixtures, doc pages, and plan entries are deleted, and §3 / §16.4 /
  `PLAN.md` are updated to match.
- **No speculative surface (§2.3, §2.4).** No method, type, or parameter is
  added "for later" or "to make access easier". Every public item has a
  present-day caller in at least two independent places before it becomes a
  shared helper (§15.5).

### 23.4 Tests, docs, and process

- **Tests are part of this change (§7).** Bug → a reproducer that failed
  before and passes after; feature → core, negative, and edge-case tests;
  refactor → the existing covering tests identified and run. No `#[ignore]`,
  no weakened assertion, no "tests later". This applies to **every** bug the
  change closes — the one you were asked about *and* any other the gate
  surfaces or you notice (§2.18); a bug is never fixed without its regression
  test, and an escalated-but-not-yet-fixed defect (§15.7) carries that
  test requirement with it (§7).
- **No test failed even once and was left "fixed" by a re-run (§7).** If any
  test failed at any point during the change — including a failure you
  attributed to "machine load", CPU contention, an oversubscribed host, a slow
  runner, or "it passes when run on its own" — it was diagnosed to root cause
  and fixed structurally so it cannot recur under any load, with a regression
  test, **not** waved through by re-running it in isolation. "Machine load" is
  never an accepted diagnosis (§7); a green re-run is not a fix. A completion
  report that describes any failure as transient, a load flake, or resolved by
  retry is a failed gate.
- **Whole-project gate run (§7, §15.6).** `cargo fmt --all`, the full
  `cargo xtask ci` (run **exactly once** — never twice consecutively), and
  `cargo xtask fuzz --secs 5` (plus whatever `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
  *beyond* `cargo xtask ci` itself — the `tools/ci/soak.sh` soak, not a second
  `cargo xtask ci`) were executed over the **entire** workspace — never a `-p`
  subset — and the actual output is quoted in the completion report. The
  coverage targets (§7) still hold. A change confined to the planning and
  charter documents is the one exemption (§2.15) and is not failed for having
  no gate output; every other item of this gate still applies to it.
- **Docs updated in the same change (§2.8, §13).** Rustdoc on every public
  item, the relevant `docs/src/` page, and any affected `README.md` stability
  tier (§6) are current. No stale symbol references remain.
- **Assumptions stated (§15.7).** Any assumption that cannot be verified from
  the repository was surfaced, not silently relied upon.

### 23.5 Verdict

State the verdict explicitly when reporting the task: which gate items were
checked, what the whole-project run output was, and — if anything is
incomplete, blocked, or deferred — exactly what and why (§15). A clean
compile and green tests with an unstated or failed gate is **not** a passing
change.

## 24. Resource Limits and Scalability

TAIRiX must scale with the hardware it runs on. A resource *capacity* — how
many tasks, threads, CPUs, open handles, memory regions, or stacks the system
or a process can use — must never be a hard-wired compile-time constant that
silently caps a large machine or a busy workload. This section is binding and
as non-negotiable as §2. It builds on the allocator and fail-closed rules (§4),
the capability model (§5), performance (§2.16), and the System Information API
(§16.6).

The motivating defect class: a fixed `const` ceiling (e.g. a single 2 MiB kernel
stack arena holding ~30 stacks, a `MAX_CPUS = 8/16` array, a fixed kthread
stack size) that is ample on a developer's laptop but becomes a scaling cliff —
or wasted reservation — on a 128-core server or a 64 MiB embedded board. Such a
constant is a §2.16 defect, not an acceptable default.

### 24.1 No fixed-constant capacity ceiling

- A resource capacity is **derived**, not hard-coded. It is sized from the
  hardware actually discovered at boot (the §18.1 hardware tree: RAM window,
  CPU/hart count) and/or grows on demand, never from a literal `const` that
  ignores the machine.
- Where a backing structure must be sized up front (a per-CPU array, an arena),
  it is sized from the discovered count/quantity with a documented headroom
  policy — never a magic number that a larger machine outgrows. A static array
  indexed by CPU id, hart id, or task slot whose length is a hand-picked
  constant is a defect; size it from §18 discovery or make it grow.
- **Grow before you fail.** When a capacity is reached and more of the
  underlying resource exists, the subsystem **grows** (e.g. chain a second
  arena, reallocate, fine-map another block) rather than degrading or refusing.
  Growth must preserve every safety invariant of the original allocation
  (isolation, guard pages §4, break-before-make §17.2, zero-on-free §4) and is
  paid off the hot path (§2.16), amortised, never busy-looped (§2.1).
- Exhausting the *physical* resource still **fails closed** as a `Result`,
  never a panic (§4, §2.9): growth is attempted first, and only a genuine
  out-of-resource condition (no more RAM, hard limit reached) returns the
  typed error.

### 24.2 Default profiles, tuned for desktop *and* server

- Every scalable resource has a **default** policy that is sensible for a
  general-purpose desktop running interactive user tasks *and* for a server
  running many concurrent services — chosen by measurement/reasoning (§2.16),
  not guesswork, and documented in the owning crate and its `docs/src/` page.
- The default is expressed as a *policy* (a function of discovered hardware,
  e.g. "N per CPU", "a fraction of usable RAM", "grow by one block on
  exhaustion"), not a frozen scalar. Headless (§17.3), embedded-small, and
  large-SMP configurations must each get a workable default from the same
  policy without code changes.
- A release-tuned value is preferred over a worst-case debug value where the
  two differ (e.g. stack sizing); the rationale is recorded (§2.16).

### 24.3 Settable limits — the `ulimit`/`rlimit`-equivalent

- Administrators and users can **impose** limits below the system default,
  per process and per user, through a first-class resource-limit facility — the
  TAIRiX equivalent of POSIX `ulimit`/`rlimit`. The shell command is named
  `ulimit` (`userland/shell/`), backed by a versioned, capability-checked ABI.
- The limit ABI lives in `lib/abi` under the same discipline as the syscall
  table (§9) and the System Information API (§16.6): versioned, hashed, and
  frozen on the first release. Each limit has a soft and a hard bound; a process
  may lower its own soft bound freely, but **raising a hard bound, or any
  limit above the inherited ceiling, requires an explicit capability** (e.g.
  `CAP_RLIMIT_RAISE`) — never ambient authority (§4, §5.2).
- Limits are inherited across spawn and are intersected, never widened, on
  delegation (mirrors §5.2). Enforcement is in the kernel resource path and
  **fails closed** (§5.4): a request that would exceed an effective limit is
  denied as a typed error, and the decision is logged (§19.4) where
  security-relevant.
- Current effective limits and live resource usage are observable through the
  System Information API (§16.6) behind the appropriate capability — never
  through a `/proc`-style file (§16.1).

### 24.4 What this does *not* relax — fixed security and format bounds stay fixed

This section governs *resource capacities*. It does **not** apply to, and must
never be used to loosen, bounds that exist for **security, correctness, or
format conformance**. These remain deliberately fixed and fail-closed (§5.4,
§2.17):

- Validation bounds on untrusted input (e.g. parser parameter/byte caps such as
  `lib/vt`'s `MAX_PARAMS`/`MAX_STRING`, `lib/fdt` `MAX_DEPTH`, SVG vertex/layer
  caps, command-line/config length caps) — these are defences (§19.5), not
  capacities; widening them "to be flexible" is a security regression (§2.17).
- On-disk / wire format constants dictated by an external or native format
  (ext4/FAT32 block sizes and name lengths, ARXFS metadata-block size, ABI
  record sizes) — fixed by the format, not by us (§2.13, §21).
- Explicitly charter-blessed fixed defaults, such as the §22 random output
  reserve (a 2 KiB, preferably per-CPU, default is sanctioned there).

When in doubt whether a constant is a *capacity* (must scale) or a *bound*
(must stay fixed), stop and ask (§15.7). Turning a security bound into a
growable capacity, or a capacity into a frozen ceiling, are both defects.

### 24.5 Enforcement

- A new or touched capacity constant is reviewed under §23.2 (performance /
  scalability): a reviewer rejects a hand-picked ceiling that a larger machine
  outgrows or a smaller machine wastes, in favour of a discovered/grown policy.
- The resource-limit facility (§24.3) is exercised by tests covering: default
  policy on small/large discovered hardware, growth on capacity exhaustion,
  fail-closed on physical exhaustion, soft/hard bound semantics, the
  capability gate on raising a hard bound, and inheritance/intersection across
  spawn and delegation (§7).

## 25. Userland Heap (`lib/rt` global allocator)

First-party Rust userland programs have a heap. `tairix-rt` registers the
process `#[global_allocator]` (`lib/rt/src/heap.rs`), so a program that links
the runtime (§1, §16.4) can use `alloc` — `Box`, `Vec`, `String`, … — with no
extra setup. This section is binding and documents the one userland heap so no
one writes a second.

- **One heap, per process, no second allocator.** The `lib/rt` global
  allocator is the only userland heap. A program (or `lib/*` crate consumed by
  userland) must **not** roll its own `malloc`/arena/bump allocator alongside
  it — that is the §2.2 duplication this section forecloses. It is genuinely
  per-process (§4): each process owns its own arena in its own address space;
  there is no shared global user heap.
- **`mem_map`-backed, capability-clean.** The heap is built **only** on the
  `abi-v1` anonymous-memory pair (`mem_map` / `mem_unmap`, both unprivileged,
  §16.6). It adds no syscall, no ABI surface, and no ambient authority (§5.4):
  every check stays kernel-side. The arena is mapped `RW`-only, never
  executable (W^X, §19.2), and the kernel zeroes every frame on map and on
  free, so no cross-process bytes ever leak (§4).
- **No raw pointer arithmetic without bounds checks (§4).** The free-list
  bookkeeping lives inside the allocator, never as intrusive links in user
  memory; every returned pointer is range-checked before it is handed out.
- **Deterministic OOM, never a panic (§4 / §2.9).** Exhaustion — `mem_map`
  can supply neither an arena page nor a metadata page — returns null per the
  `GlobalAlloc` contract. Allocation failure is never a panic.
- **Reallocation resizes in place where it can (§2.16).** `realloc` shrinks in
  place (returning the tail to the free list, unmapping freed top pages above
  the retention below) and grows in place when the following bytes are free or
  the block abuts the growable arena top, copying only as a last resort.
- **Free top pages are retained, not surrendered per free (§2.16, §26.3).**
  Unmapping every free page at the arena top on each `free` costs that
  `mem_unmap` plus the next `mem_map` — two page-table walks, two kernel
  zeroing passes and a TLB shootdown to every other CPU — for pages the heap
  is about to want again, and every allocation high-water that oscillates
  across a page boundary pays it. The heap keeps free top pages mapped up to a
  retention and unmaps only the excess. The retention is the shared reclaim
  policy's own figure — `shrink_target` for `ReclaimClass::RuntimeCache` over a
  `CacheBudget::from_backing(arena_bytes)`, floored at one page — so it scales
  with the process rather than resting on a hand-picked ceiling (§24.1/§24.2)
  and reaches zero from moderate pressure onward. An unreported band reads as
  critical and retains nothing, so a process that never wires the pressure
  protocol behaves exactly as one with no retention at all (fail closed);
  `pressure::report` releases the retention on a band change, so a process that
  has stopped allocating still gives it back. The retention is also the least
  the arena **grows** by, so a run of small allocations pays no `mem_map` per
  page; mapping beyond what the caller asked for is speculation about the next
  allocation, so that pad shrinks with the band and is zero under real pressure.
- **The arena is resized in granules, so a teardown cannot storm the machine
  (§2.16, §26.1).** A retention bounds what may be *kept*; it cannot bound a
  teardown's syscalls, because a level slides down with the free span it bounds
  — once the free top exceeds it, every further free of a page hands that single
  page back. A descending teardown of a 16 MiB arena cost 3840 `mem_unmap`
  calls that way, each taking the **global** address-space registry's write lock
  and shooting down the TLB on every other CPU, so one process's teardown
  serialised every other process's frame. The heap therefore releases a free top
  only once at least `ARENA_RESIZE_BYTES` of it stands above the retention, and
  then releases all of it. That figure is deliberately **not** derived from the
  machine, the process, or the band: it is not a capacity (§24.1) but the ratio
  at which one call's fixed cost stops mattering against the per-page work the
  same call already does, and a proportional granule would hold a sixteenth of a
  gibibyte arena back from a machine already asking for it. The band keeps the
  last word: the trim `pressure::report` drives is **exact** — it ignores the
  granule and releases everything above the retention in one call — so the
  residue an allocation path may leave, even at critical pressure, is never held
  past the next band change.
- **The free-span table is a growable capacity, not a fixed ceiling (§24.1).**
  It maps further metadata pages on demand rather than capping a fragmented
  workload at a hand-picked `const`.
- **Secret hygiene is the holder's job, not the heap's.** The heap does **not**
  re-zero a process's own freed bytes (reuse within one address space is not a
  security boundary, §2.16). Userland code holding a credential, key, or
  capability token zeroes it before drop (e.g. a zeroizing wrapper); it does
  not rely on the allocator to scrub freed heap bytes.
- **Documented and tested.** The design lives in `lib/rt/src/heap.rs` rustdoc
  and `lib/rt/README.md`; the pure bookkeeping is host-unit-tested and the end
  to end path (including `realloc` grow/shrink with data preservation) is a
  QEMU vertical (`tests/integration/heap_program` + `heap_qemu_aarch64`).

## 26. Operating-Conditions Design Assumptions

TAIRiX is designed for **real, contended, imperfect hardware under sustained
multi-user load**, never for the quiet single-user laptop a developer happens
to test on. Every part of the system — kernel subsystem, driver, `lib/*`
crate, userland service, and every spec/plan — MUST be designed, written, and
reviewed against the operating conditions below. They are binding and as
non-negotiable as §2: a design that only behaves under ideal conditions
(one disk, one user, ample RAM, idle network, healthy hardware) is defective
even when it compiles and its tests pass (§23). This section names the
conditions; it does not relax any existing rule — it focuses §2.16
(performance), §4 (memory/OOM), §5.4 (fail closed), §17.1 (scheduling),
§19 (threat model), and §24 (scalability) onto the workloads TAIRiX must
actually survive.

These are *design assumptions*, not optional tuning. When the clean design and
the robust-under-load design differ, the robust one is the §2.6 senior bar.
When a requirement here conflicts with another in-flight design or another
rule, stop and ask (§15.7) — never resolve it with a "for now" shortcut
(§2.19).

### 26.1 Many heterogeneous disks of differing speed, all contended

- The machine may present **many** storage devices at once — one or more fast
  NVMe drives **and** many slow rotational SATA drives — each discovered as its
  own hardware-tree node (§18.1) and driven concurrently (§4 SMP). No design
  may assume a single disk, a single queue, or one storage class.
- **Per-device, not global.** Queueing, scheduling, caching, readahead, and
  back-pressure are reasoned about and accounted **per device**, sized from the
  device's own discovered characteristics (§24.1/§24.2), never from one global
  constant that lumps a 7 ms-seek spinning disk together with a sub-100 µs NVMe
  namespace. A fixed compile-time queue depth or buffer count shared across
  classes is the §24.1 defect.
- **A slow device must never stall a fast one, and one user's I/O must never
  monopolise a device (§17.1, §2.16).** I/O issued to a slow rotational drive
  must not block, serialise behind, or steal the bandwidth of an unrelated
  fast device or an unrelated user's request. Request scheduling is fair across
  users (the `(uid, …)` of §5.1) and across devices; one tenant's bulk
  sequential read cannot starve another's latency-sensitive access. Waiters
  block and are woken by completion — never busy-poll a queue (§2.23).
- **Bound the work, fail closed (§5.4, §24.3).** Per-user and per-process I/O
  concurrency, queue occupancy, and cache footprint are bounded through the
  §24.3 resource-limit facility and fail closed when a limit is reached, rather
  than letting an unbounded fan-out of requests exhaust kernel memory (§4).

### 26.2 Many simultaneous users, each with greedy processes

- The system may host **many logged-in users at once**, each running processes
  that are individually memory-hungry, disk-hungry, CPU-hungry, or I/O-hungry.
  Isolation between users and between processes is a hardware-enforced default
  (§4, §5.1), not a behaviour that degrades under load.
- **Fair share, bounded blast radius.** No single user or process may starve
  the others of CPU (§17.1 fairness/no-starvation, exercised by the §17.1
  conformance suite), memory (§4 per-process heaps, §24.3 limits), disk
  bandwidth (§26.1), or I/O completion handling. A greedy or runaway tenant is
  throttled or denied through the §24.3 limit facility and fails closed (§5.4);
  it never brings down or wedges the system for everyone else.
- **Accounting is per principal.** Resource usage is attributed to the owning
  `(uid, gid, …)` (§5.1) and observable through the System Information API
  (§16.6) behind the appropriate capability — never a `/proc`-style scrape
  (§16.1).

### 26.3 Operating under memory pressure

- **Memory may be scarce at any time, and the system must stay correct and
  responsive when it is.** Designs assume RAM can be constrained — a small
  board (§24.2) or a large machine whose RAM is fully committed by many users
  (§26.2) — not that allocation always succeeds.
- **Every allocation can fail, and failure is a `Result`, never a panic (§4,
  §2.9).** Out-of-memory is handled as a value on the spot, with all
  partially-acquired resources released (§23.2 error paths). `unwrap`/`expect`/
  `panic!` on an allocation path is a defect (§2.9).
- **Reclaim before refusal, and reclaim safely.** Caches, buffers, and other
  growable capacities (§24.1) are sized to shrink under pressure and to be
  reclaimed before the system denies forward progress — preserving every safety
  invariant when they do (zero-on-free §4, isolation §4). Anonymous, stack, and
  capability-bearing pages that are paged out go to **encrypted swap only**
  (§4); there is no plaintext-swap fallback under pressure.
- **No memory-pressure busy-loops.** A subsystem waiting on reclaim parks and
  is woken (§2.23), it does not spin retrying an allocation.

### 26.4 Heavy network and external I/O serving many remote users

- The machine may sustain **high volumes of network and other external I/O**
  while serving many external clients at once. The networking and I/O paths are
  designed for many concurrent connections, not a single flow, and are
  efficient by construction on their data path (§2.16).
- **Event-driven, never busy-polled (§2.23).** Connections, sockets, and device
  queues block and are woken by their interrupt/completion event; a service
  with nothing to do until data arrives parks (`irq_wait`/`WaitQueue`/IPC
  backing), it does not peg a core spinning. A periodic re-poll fallback is
  tickless and one-shot-timed (§17.1), never a tight loop.
- **Untrusted external input is hostile and sandboxed (§19.5).** Every decoder
  of attacker-controlled network input runs in a minimum-capability sandbox
  with a fuzz harness (§19.6); a parser crash is contained and the sandbox
  replaced, never taking down the serving process (§19.5). External clients are
  treated as adversaries (§5, §19), and per-client resource use is bounded and
  fails closed (§24.3, §5.4) so a flood cannot exhaust kernel memory (§4) or
  starve other tenants (§26.2).

### 26.5 A disk may be failing

- **Storage hardware is assumed to be able to fail — slowly, intermittently, or
  outright — and the system must degrade gracefully, never crash.** A read or
  write that errors, times out, returns corrupt data, or hangs is an expected
  outcome a driver and the filesystem layer handle as a typed `Result`, never a
  panic (§2.9) and never an unbounded retry-until-it-works (§2.1).
- **Detect, contain, report.** I/O errors are surfaced as typed errors up the
  stack, the affected device/volume is contained (a failing disk must not wedge
  unrelated devices or the whole system, §26.1), and the event is logged
  through the hash-chained audit log with a stable event ID (§19.4) so a
  failing drive is observable through the System Information API (§16.6).
- **Integrity over silent corruption (§5.4 fail closed).** ARXFS checksums
  every record (§3, ARXFS spec) so corruption from a failing disk is *detected*
  rather than silently served; on a checksum or read failure the layer fails
  closed and reports, it does not return data it cannot vouch for. Bounded,
  documented retry/timeout budgets that fail closed are permitted; an unbounded
  spin or a hang is not (§2.1, §2.23).
- **No data-loss shortcut.** A failing disk is never "handled" by ignoring the
  error, masking it, or weakening a checksum/validation to make I/O appear to
  succeed (§2.17) — that is a security and correctness regression and a review
  blocker (§23).

### 26.6 Very large filesystems (well over 100 TB)

- **A mounted volume or filesystem may exceed 100 TB, and every size, count,
  offset, and address that describes on-disk data is 64-bit-native (§21).** No
  design may assume a volume, file, directory, extent map, free-space map, or
  object count fits in 32 bits or in pointer width (`usize`/`isize`) — pointer
  width is not storage width any more than it is time width (§21). A block
  number, byte offset, inode/record id, or file length stored or computed as
  32-bit (or as `usize`) is a defect, on every target including `wasm32` and
  any 32-bit port.
- **Metadata scales sub-linearly; no whole-volume scan on the hot path.**
  Mount, lookup, allocation, free-space search, `stat`, and directory listing
  must not require reading, building, or walking an O(volume-size) in-memory
  structure: a 100 TB+ volume cannot have its entire allocation map, inode
  table, or directory index resident or linearly scanned per operation. ARXFS
  and every filesystem driver use paged, on-demand, indexed (B-tree / extent /
  bitmap-hierarchy) structures so cost scales with the working set, not the
  device (§2.16, §24.1). A design that is fine at 1 TB but quadratic or
  memory-proportional at 100 TB is a §2.16 / §24.1 defect.
- **In-memory caches of on-disk metadata are bounded, growable capacities, not
  whole-volume residents (§24.1, §26.3).** The fraction of a huge volume's
  metadata cached at once is sized from discovered RAM and reclaimed under
  pressure (§26.3) — never "load the whole table". A small machine must mount
  and serve a 100 TB+ volume; running out of RAM proportional to volume size is
  the §24.1 / §26.3 defect.
- **Long-running whole-volume operations are incremental, interruptible, and
  fail closed.** Format (mkfs), check/repair, scrub, resize, and rebalance over
  a 100 TB+ device must make bounded forward progress, be cancellable, report
  progress, and never block the system or busy-spin (§2.23) for the hours such
  an operation legitimately takes; an I/O error mid-operation fails closed and
  reports (§5.4, §26.5), it does not corrupt or silently truncate.
- **Foreign-format limits are declared, not papered over (§21).** Where an
  ext4 / FAT32 / other foreign volume imposes its own maximum volume, file, or
  offset size, the driver declares those limits through the filesystem
  capability API and fails closed when a TAIRiX request exceeds them (§21) —
  it never silently wraps, truncates, or saturates a large size into a foreign
  format's narrower field.

### 26.7 Many huge drives on a tiny machine — the combined minimum floor

The conditions above are not independent dials a design may satisfy one at a
time; TAIRiX MUST satisfy them **simultaneously**. The binding worst-case
floor every storage and memory design is held to:

- **A machine with as little as 1 GiB of RAM MUST mount and serve *several*
  100 TB+ drives at once, without issue.** "Without issue" means no panic, no
  out-of-memory crash, no refusal to mount, no busy-spin, and no
  silent-corruption shortcut — the system stays correct, responsive, and
  fail-closed (§2.9, §4, §5.4, §2.23). This is the explicit conjunction of the
  "many heterogeneous disks" assumption (§26.1), the "operating under memory
  pressure" assumption (§26.3), and the "very large filesystems" assumption
  (§26.6); a design that meets any one of them but breaks when all three hold
  together is defective (§23).
- **RAM is sized to the working set, never to the storage.** Total resident
  metadata across *all* mounted volumes combined is a bounded, growable
  capacity sized from discovered RAM and reclaimed under pressure (§24.1,
  §26.3, §26.6) — never proportional to aggregate device size or volume count.
  Mounting an additional 100 TB+ drive adds working-set-bounded footprint, not
  a fixed per-volume slab that a 1 GiB machine cannot afford; a per-mount
  allocation that scales with device size (or a hand-picked constant times the
  number of volumes) is the §24.1 defect this clause forecloses.
- **Aggregate I/O across many large devices stays fair and bounded.** Many
  concurrently busy drives — fast and slow, large and small — share the
  machine's scarce RAM and CPU without one device's queues, caches, or readahead
  starving another or exhausting kernel memory (§26.1, §26.2, §24.3). Per-device
  and per-user bounds (§24.3) hold under the combined load and fail closed when
  reached, never degrading into unbounded allocation (§4).
- **Tested at the floor, not just in the abstract.** The §24.5 / §7 scalability
  tests exercise this conjunction: small discovered RAM (on the order of 1 GiB)
  with multiple emulated 100 TB+ volumes mounted and active at once, asserting
  bounded resident metadata, growth-then-fail-closed on exhaustion, and no
  panic or busy-spin. A design that only demonstrates each condition in
  isolation has not met this floor.

## 27. Foundational Implementations Are Complete, Not Minimal

A **foundational primitive** — a kernel subsystem (§4), a scheduling or
synchronisation primitive (§17.1, `lib/sync`), an allocator (§4, §25), an
IPC/capability path (§5), a wait/park primitive, a data structure or
`lib/*` building block other code builds on — is implemented as the
*complete, production-grade thing it names*, not as the smallest subset
its first caller happens to exercise. This is binding and as
non-negotiable as §2. It is the positive resolution of the tension
between §2.6 (senior-developer quality) and §2.3/§2.4 (no bloat / no
interface creep): those rules forbid **speculative** surface, they do
**not** license shipping an incomplete core.

1. **Implement the abstraction, not the caller's slice.** The test is
   "what would a senior kernel engineer expect this primitive to *be*?",
   never "what does the one current call site touch?". A wait-queue that
   can only `wake_all` is not a wait-queue; a map that only ever appends
   is not a map. The complete, well-understood operation set of the
   primitive is present, correct, and tested — even where today only a
   subset has callers.
2. **Right data structure and algorithm, from the start.** A foundational
   primitive uses the structure a real kernel would (an ordered/indexed
   set, a timer wheel or heap for deadlines, an intrusive list for O(1)
   removal — never an O(n) linear scan of a `Vec` on a hot or
   load-bearing path where the workload can grow). "It's fine while the
   set is tiny" is the §24.1 fixed-ceiling defect wearing a different
   coat: size and complexity are reasoned about for §26 load, not a
   developer's laptop.
3. **Fairness, ordering, and starvation are designed in.** Any primitive
   on the scheduling or resource path (§17.1, §24) has a *stated*
   fairness/ordering discipline (FIFO, priority, anti-starvation) and a
   wake-one path where a wake-all would be a thundering herd — not
   "wake everyone and let the scheduler sort it out".
4. **This is not a licence to invent surface (§2.3/§2.4).** Completeness
   means the operations, correctness, and robustness *intrinsic to the
   abstraction*, and only those. Do not add methods, versions, or
   parameters for hypothetical *other* abstractions or unrequested
   features — that is still creep. The line: fill out the primitive you
   are building; do not bolt on a different one.
5. **"Minimal for now" is the §2.19 defect.** Shipping a deliberately
   thin core meaning to "flesh it out when a second caller needs it" is
   exactly the deferred-correctness §2.19 forbids. If the complete
   primitive is genuinely too large for the current change, you do the
   part you land *completely* and **stop and ask** (§15.7) with the
   remainder staged in `PLAN.md`/`plans/` — you never quietly ship the
   thin version and call it done.
6. **Reviewed under §23.** A foundational primitive that is correct but
   substantively incomplete — missing an operation the abstraction
   implies, an O(n) structure where the workload demands better, or an
   absent fairness/wake-one path — is a §23.2 defect and a review
   blocker, regardless of a green compile and green tests.

## 28. Interactive Surfaces Answer Within a Frame

An **interactive surface** — the desktop session's compositor/serve loop, an
application's window event loop, a TUI's key loop, the compositor itself — is
there to answer the user inside a frame. Two things stop it answering:
**waiting**, and **working**. So it performs no blocking I/O — not in response
to input, not while painting, and never as a consequence of a control's value
changing — *and* it does no unbounded work per input event. I/O belongs on a
worker: the loop *requests* and *collects*. Painting belongs after the input is
drained: the loop *marks* and *paints once*. This is binding and as
non-negotiable as §2. It states, once and for all, the rule §2.16, §2.23, §26.1
and §26.2 imply and that `plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md` was re-deriving each time a
freeze was found.

Both defect classes were found on the same settings slider, one behind the
other:

- **Waiting.** The slider's value was wired straight to a settings write, so
  **every pointer-motion sample of a drag** cost an IPC round trip to the
  configuration service and a disk commit. The window froze for the whole drag.
- **Working.** With the write removed, the same slider still re-derived
  *everything* per sample: it discarded the retained screen, re-ran the whole
  post-processing pipeline over every pixel, reallocated a screen-sized buffer,
  resized the hosted pty, and reset the animation history — for a change to one
  field that none of it depended on. Nothing waited on a device, and the drag
  was still not smooth.

A design that stays responsive only on an idle machine with a fast local disk
and a small window is defective (§26), even when it compiles and its tests pass.

1. **No blocking I/O on an interactive loop.** No syscall or IPC round trip
   that waits on a device, a filesystem, or another service runs on a loop
   that owes the user a frame — no store read or commit, no `fs_*` on a file
   or directory, no whole-store walk, no manifest read. A loop that must have
   such work done hands it to a worker and carries on serving.
2. **A control's value is never tied to a write.** Moving a slider, dragging
   a scrollbar, typing in a field, or picking a row changes the in-memory
   model and repaints. That is all it does: it opens no store, sends no
   request, and writes no file. Coupling a control's value to a persistence
   write is the defect this section exists to forbid.
3. **A continuous interaction acts durably once, when it settles.** A
   continuous control reports its settle point, and the durable action is
   taken *there* — never once per motion sample. One drag is at most one
   write. Where no settle point can be observed, the write is coalesced
   latest-wins, so any number of edits cost at most one further write.
4. **Persist-then-adopt happens off the loop.** Where a setting must not
   diverge from its store, the surface renders a **live** interaction state
   and adopts the **durable** one only once the write has landed, taking what
   it adopts from the store's own post-write answer (so a layer beneath the
   user's document still wins). It never blocks the loop to find out. A
   refused write states why (§2.24) and reverts the live state; it never
   silently leaves a value on screen that the next start would not restore.
5. **Reads are requested, never awaited.** Listings, artwork, catalogues,
   manifests, thumbnails and file contents are asked for and collected later.
   **A paint reads nothing**: it draws what has already arrived, and a
   meaningful placeholder for what has not (§10's built-in glyph tier is that
   rule for icons). Recording a request is not I/O; performing one is.
6. **One deferral mechanism, shared.** The arrangement is a pure
   request/answer desk, a worker that parks (never spins, §2.23), and one wake
   into the loop's existing wait-set. A surface does not invent a second
   scheme, and a desk with more than one consumer lives in `lib/*` rather than
   beside one of them (§2.2). Where the machine grants no worker the work
   falls back to the requesting thread — slower under load, never wrong, and
   never a silently dropped request.
7. **The bounded I/O exceptions, and nothing else.** In-memory work, work
   already dequeued, and the frame-present the display protocol serialises are
   not I/O. That list is exhaustive; reaching for it to excuse a store write, a
   file read, or a directory walk on the loop is the defect.
8. **Input updates state; the frame is produced from state.** An event handler
   records what changed and asks for a paint; it does not paint. The paint
   happens once, after the available input is drained, from the state those
   events left behind. A handler that presents inline hands the frame rate to
   the input device, which is not its to set.
9. **A burst of input produces one paint, not one per event.** Pointer motion,
   wheel deltas, key repeats and resize samples all arrive faster than a screen
   can show them, and a frame the user never sees is work spent for nothing at
   any cost. Drain, then paint. A surface that genuinely cannot drain first
   paints at most once per present the display protocol serialises.
10. **A repaint rebuilds only what the change invalidates.** Re-deriving the
    whole surface because *something* changed is the defect, however cheap it
    looks in the file it sits in: the cost then scales with the surface rather
    than with the edit, so it is worst exactly where the surface is largest and
    the machine slowest. Scope the work to what changed — the damage the
    controls reported, the caches the change actually stales. A change that
    genuinely restyles or reshapes the whole surface (a re-theme, a resize, a
    scale change) repaints it whole: that *is* its scope, not an exception to
    having one.
11. **A change never reaches state it does not name.** A control's value
    touches what that value means and nothing else. Re-deriving unrelated state
    in passing is not merely wasted work, it is wrong behaviour — a discarded
    animation history, a spurious resize delivered to a hosted process, a warm
    cache dropped and rebuilt — and it is a defect at any cost, including none.
12. **Reviewed under §23.** A surface that stalls on I/O, a control wired to a
    write, a paint that reads, a handler that paints inline, an uncoalesced
    burst, or a repaint scoped wider than its change is a §23.2 defect and a
    review blocker, however small the file it sits in and however fast the
    developer's disk and screen.

The staged enforcement across the desktop is `plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`; the
control-side obligations — a continuous control reporting its settle point, and
the damage it reports so a repaint can be scoped — are specified with the
control families in `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`; the compositor-side damage,
present-batching and frame-pacing machinery a scoped repaint is built on is
`plans/FIX-DESKTOP-SPEEDUP.md`.

Violation of any rule in this document is a defect, regardless of whether
the code compiles or the tests pass.
