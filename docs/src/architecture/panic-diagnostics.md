# Kernel panic diagnostics (registers + backtrace)

A TAIRiX kernel panic is fatal, non-recoverable, and halts the offending
CPU (fail closed, never a silent reset). Because it is a post-mortem, its
dump carries everything an investigator needs: the source location, a
snapshot of the CPU register file, and a bounded stack backtrace. This
page describes what a panic record contains, which images produce which
parts, the deliberate address-leak policy, and how to resolve raw
addresses offline.

Two things end a kernel this way: a Rust `panic!`, and a **CPU exception
taken in kernel mode** that the port's vector has no fix-up for. Both go
through the one report path (`kernel_core::panic_dump` /
`kernel_core::fault_dump`), so both carry the same register block and
backtrace; only the cause fields and the audit event id differ.

## What a panic record contains

The panic handler emits exactly one `AuditEvent::Panic` record through the
audit sink, then halts. Its fields:

| Field           | Meaning                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu`           | Decimal id of the CPU that panicked.                           |
| `file`          | Source file of the panic (`<unknown>` if absent).             |
| `line` `column` | Decimal source position.                                       |
| `pc` `sp` `fp`  | `0x`-prefixed 64-bit hex of the captured program counter, stack pointer, and frame pointer. |
| `<reg>`         | One field per captured named general-purpose register (`rax`, `x0`, `ra`, …), each 64-bit hex. |
| `frame_0`       | The captured program counter — the top of the call chain.      |
| `frame_1..`     | The return addresses recovered by walking the frame-pointer chain, in caller order. |
| `peers_asked`   | Online CPUs other than this one that the stop-the-world asked to halt. |
| `peers_stopped` | How many of them acknowledged.                                 |
| `peer_unresponsive` | Present only when one did not — see "Stopping the world" below. |
| `root`          | The active translation root (`TTBR0_EL1` / `CR3` / `satp`), when the port can read it. |

Every fatal report path in the image — this post-mortem, a port's own
report, the pre-init window — first takes an entry from one shared latch
(`tairix_arch_api::fatal::enter`). The boot's first entry writes the full
report. The next writes one bare record under its own cause's id — a panic
or fault raised while a report is being written, or a second CPU failing
while the first reports — and never re-enters the machinery that may have
failed: the display reclaim, the register capture, the walk. Only once the
record is written does it drain the console, since that drain may be what
failed. Every later entry writes nothing and halts, so a report whose own
bare record or drain faults cannot recurse until the stack overruns. On
aarch64 with stage-1 translation off, where every access is Device memory
and an exclusive may never complete, the port takes the latch with plain
accesses instead.

## What a kernel-fault record contains

The production boot installs the fatal-fault handler on the boot CPU as
soon as its exception vector is live, so a kernel-mode exception reaches
the same report rather than parking the CPU in silence. Its record is
`AuditEvent::KernelFault` (`4011`):

| Field        | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu`        | Decimal id of the CPU that faulted.                         |
| `syndrome`   | 64-bit hex of the port's exception syndrome — `ESR_EL1`, the packed x86_64 vector and error code, `scause`. |
| `fault_addr` | 64-bit hex of the address the access could not reach — `FAR_EL1`, `CR2`, `stval`. |
| `fault_pc`   | 64-bit hex of the faulting instruction — `ELR_EL1`, `RIP`, `sepc`. |
| `fault_sp`   | 64-bit hex of the kernel stack pointer the faulting code ran on. |

A word the CPU did not give is `null`, never a zero or a stale register
that reads as a value:

- `syndrome` for an aarch64 FIQ, or an IRQ from AArch32, for which
  `ESR_EL1` is not written.
- `fault_addr` outside the classes that write one: aarch64 instruction and
  data aborts, PC alignment faults and watchpoints with `FnV` clear;
  x86_64 page faults; riscv64 misaligned accesses, access faults, page
  faults and breakpoints (an illegal instruction's `stval` holds its bits).
- `fault_sp` for a fault taken from user mode, which ran on no kernel
  stack, and for an x86_64 `#DF`, whose saved state Intel documents as
  undefined.

plus, when there is a `fault_addr` and the port has a non-faulting
translation probe:

| Field        | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fault_maps` | `yes` / `no` / `unsupported` — whether `fault_addr` translates under the active root *at report time*. |
| `fault_par`  | The probe's raw result: the physical address when it maps, the port's fault status when it does not. |
| `fault_hole` | Present only when it does not map: `page`, `block`, or `gigapage` — the coarsest granule around the address that is *also* absent. |
| `maps_after_tlbi` | Present only when it does not map: whether it translates once this CPU's cached translations are discarded. `yes` means the tables were right and the TLB was not. |
| `par_after_tlbi` | The post-flush probe's raw result, read like `fault_par`. |
| `desc_0..`   | Present only when it does not map: the raw translation descriptors the active regime holds for it, root-downward. |

followed by the same register and `frame_N` blocks as a panic. `fault_pc`
and `fault_sp` are the *interrupted* code's; the register block's `pc` and
`sp` are where the handler shim itself was captured, so they are
deliberately distinct keys. A fault carries no `file`/`line`/`column`, and
a panic carries no syndrome — neither is fabricated for the other, which is
why the two are distinct event ids rather than one record with optional
halves.

Every kernel-mode exception is reported, on every port. aarch64 and riscv64
fan every unhandled synchronous exception (plus FIQ / `SError` / AArch32
entries on aarch64) into one tail, and x86_64 gives every exception vector
its own stub into its tail, the resumable page-fault entry reaching the same
handler.

## Before a fault handler is installed

Every port arms its exception vectors in its boot entry, before
`kernel_main` runs — aarch64's `VBAR_EL1`, riscv64's `stvec`, and on x86_64
a set of boot descriptor tables that route every vector to the fatal tail
and give `#DF` a stack of its own — so no binary can take an exception with
nowhere to go. The x86_64 boot tables live in memory `linker.ld` reserves
beside the boot stack, sized by the port's own type, which the trampoline
hands to the entry. The kernel later arms each CPU for itself, and on x86_64
replaces the boot tables with per-CPU ones built by the same routine, so a
fault after `percpu::init` is reported exactly as one before it.

A fatal exception with no handler installed — a minimal QEMU test kernel,
or a fault before the production boot installs its own — gets the port's
own report instead (`tairix_arch_api::fatal`): a prose banner naming the
port's own registers, then the same `4011` record carrying the processor,
`syndrome`, `fault_addr`, `fault_pc`, `fault_sp` and the boot-stack guard's
verdict. A port's own panic report (`handle_panic_via_serial`) ends with the
`4010` record the same way, as does a port's refusal of a broken boot
invariant — a boot entered by an unknown loader, a syscall taken before the
kernel installed its dispatcher — which states the reason and parks rather
than halting silently or leaving through QEMU's debug-exit port. The
production kernel's own handlers, before boot has published its arch
handle, fall back to these same reports. The register snapshot and
backtrace are the kernel's post-mortem to add. Every fatal report therefore
ends on one of the two records, and the QEMU harness ends a run the moment
either lands rather than waiting out its inactivity budget.

`cpu` always means the kernel's dense CPU id. A port's own report names the
processor that way only where it holds the id — aarch64 seeds the boot
CPU's at entry — and otherwise by its hardware identity under that
identity's own key: `hart=` on riscv64, whose dense map lives in the
kernel's arch handle, and `apic_id=` on x86_64 before the kernel maps LAPIC
ids to dense ones.

### Why the report names the active root and re-probes

Whether an address translates is a property of the **active root**, not of the
machine: the same physical page can be mapped in one address space and absent
in another, and kernel code runs on whatever root was last activated (a
kernel thread does not switch roots). A fault report that named only the
address would therefore leave the essential question — *which* address space
refused it — unanswered.

`desc_0..` answers the question behind the absence: whether the *hierarchy*
is intact. A well-formed table descriptor pointing at a plausible table, with
one invalid leaf, is a mapping never made or since removed; a descriptor that
is arbitrary data means the table page itself has been clobbered or reused —
a page-table use-after-free, and a far worse defect. Each table is proved
translatable with the non-faulting probe before it is read, so a clobbered or
unmapped table ends the walk rather than faulting inside the fault handler,
and the walk stops at an invalid entry or a leaf.

A third reading is possible, and the descriptors alone cannot separate it from
a clobbered table: a *valid* descriptor for an address the probe refused. That
means the tables are right and the **TLB** is not — a translation changed
without the invalidation it owed, or a granule changed without
break-before-make. `maps_after_tlbi` is what distinguishes it. The probe is
permitted to answer from the TLB, so discarding this CPU's cached translations
and re-probing forces the answer to come from the tables themselves: `yes`
convicts TLB maintenance, `no` sends you back to the tables. Discarding them is
safe here precisely because the report has already read the tables it is about
to re-walk, and the port that flushes is the same one that probes — a port
without a probe reports no verdict rather than one it cannot support.

`fault_hole` separates two unrelated defects a syndrome cannot tell apart: a
leaf that something unmapped (`page`) versus a region that was never mapped at
all (`block` or `gigapage`). It is derived in the neutral layer by probing the
address's containing 2 MiB and 1 GiB bases, so it needs no extra port surface.

Re-probing the same address buys a second distinction the syndrome cannot
make. If the probe says `no`, the address is persistently unmapped under that
root. If it says `yes`, the mapping *changed* between the faulting access and
the report — a racing map/unmap, or a break-before-make that was not — which
is a wholly different defect. The probe uses only a non-faulting
address-translation instruction (aarch64's `AT`), never a hand walk of the
page tables: a report must not dereference the very memory it cannot vouch
for. x86_64 and riscv64 have no such instruction, so they report the root and
an honest `unsupported` for the probe rather than risk faulting inside the
fault handler.

Reporting a fault does **not** make it survivable. The report ends in
`KernelArch::halt`, exactly as a panic does.

## Stopping the world

A kernel-mode panic or fault means a kernel invariant is already broken and
the reporting CPU cannot resume. Leaving the other CPUs running is therefore
not a smaller failure, it is a worse one: they either deadlock on a guard the
dying core abandoned — one core's fault becoming a system-wide wedge with no
diagnosis — or they proceed over half-updated shared state, which is silent
corruption. So the report stops the world.

It reuses the one cross-CPU stop protocol the kernel already has
(`tairix_arch_api::quiesce`), not a second one: the same latched request, the
same per-port IPI poke (`SchedulerArch::send_ipi`), and the same per-port
receive path that acknowledges and parks the core masked. Only the *patience*
differs, which is why there are two initiators:

| Initiator | Caller | On an unresponsive peer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quiesce_others` | The pre-boot Supervisor's whole-RAM takeover | Fails closed after a long budget; the machine is left running and recoverable. |
| `stop_others_best_effort` | A panic or fatal-fault report | Gives up promptly and *names the peer in the record*; the report proceeds. |

A fatal report cannot fail closed — the kernel is already dying — and must not
stall the one diagnosis the machine will ever produce behind a core that
cannot answer. A healthy peer only has to take an already-pending IPI, so it
acknowledges far inside the budget; a peer that does not is wedged with
interrupts masked, and `peer_unresponsive` naming it is itself the finding.

**Order: stop, then read, then write.** The world is stopped before anything
about the machine is read. Stopping before the write is what leaves the
console queue — an `IrqSafeSpinLock`-held ring — uncontended for the report,
and stops a peer from advancing shared state while the report is assembled. It
costs at most the stop budget before the first byte appears, which is why that
budget is small.

Stopping before the *readings* is what makes them describe one machine. The
`fault_maps` / `fault_par` probe and the `desc_0..` walk interrogate memory a
running peer can still be editing, and taken either side of a concurrent
page-table update they disagree — which reads as a defect in the tables rather
than in the reading. A Pi 4 capture whose probe reported the faulting address
absent and whose walk then produced a valid descriptor for that same address
cost a diagnosis exactly this way. Because the stop is best effort, a reader
compares `peers_stopped` against `peers_asked` before trusting the readings:
a partial stop means a peer may still have moved underneath them.

**The report then drains its own bytes.** Stopping the world removes the
buffered console's drainer — `pump_console_tx` runs from the dispatch loop,
and there is none left — so the report calls
`KernelArch::flush_console_blocking` itself: once the peers are stopped, so
the queued lead-up reaches the wire ahead of the record and leaves it the
whole ring, with no producer left to keep the drain from finishing; and again
after the record, before the halt. Without it a report on a port with a
queued console truncates mid-record and the machine reads as having died
silently. Every drain runs behind the fatal latch, so one that faults — its
console corrupted by the same failure — is a nested entry, never a re-entry
that drains again. Ports whose console transmit is synchronous (riscv64 SBI,
x86_64 COM1) inherit the no-op default because their bytes are already on the
wire.

For the same reason nothing that can itself fault sits between capturing the
core's state and writing the record: the display-surface reclaim happens once,
as the first entry's first act, and is deliberately not repeated after the
stop or by a nested entry — a repaint can fault on a scan-out the active root
does not map, and losing the screen copy of a report is a far smaller failure
than losing the report.

`MachineTakeover` is deliberately *not* reused for this. That slice is the
Supervisor's irreversible tear-down: it reprograms the translation regime and
overwrites all of usable RAM, which would pull the ground out from under the
very dump being written. The stop half was already
factored out of it, which is what makes it reusable here.

Per port: aarch64, riscv64, and x86_64 all latch, poke, and park through the
paths above. wasm32 has no `KernelArch` implementation and so no in-guest
fatal-report path at all — a trapping instance is terminated by the host
harness, which tears down every worker — so there is nothing for it to
initiate or receive, and it wires neither.

## Which images produce which parts

The rule is: verbose panic is on **everywhere** when it costs no steady-state
CPU time, and the parts that cost image *size* are debug-only.

- **Register snapshot + raw (hex-address) backtrace — every image.** Frame
  pointers are already forced on all three bare-metal targets
  (`.cargo/config.toml`'s `-C force-frame-pointers=yes`), so the frame chain
  is maintained at runtime regardless. Walking it is a handful of loads, only
  at panic time when the CPU is halting anyway; reading the registers is a
  read-only snapshot. Neither adds a cycle to any hot path, so both ship in
  every image.
- **On-target symbolication (turning `0xffff…1234` into `fn_name+0x40`) —
  debug images only, and not yet implemented.** Its cost is image *size* (a
  symbol table shipped in the kernel), not CPU. The zero-image-cost default
  everywhere is to print **raw addresses** and resolve them offline against
  the unstripped kernel ELF, exactly as Linux's `decode_stacktrace.sh` does.
  An on-target `(addr, name)` table looked up by binary search on the panic
  path, gated on `cfg!(debug_assertions)`, is a staged future addition
  (`PLAN.md`); the offline workflow below is the complete story today.

Per architecture:

| Arch      | Register capture | Frame-pointer unwind |
| --------- | :--------------: | :------------------: |
| x86_64    | ✓ (`rip`/`rsp`/`rbp` + GP regs) | ✓ (saved `rbp` at `[rbp]`, return at `[rbp+8]`) |
| aarch64   | ✓ (`pc`/`sp`/`x29` + `x0..x7`/`x30`) | ✓ (saved `x29` at `[x29]`, `lr` at `[x29+8]`) |
| riscv64   | ✓ (`pc`/`sp`/`s0` + `ra`/`a0..a7`) | ✓ (saved `s0` at `[s0-16]`, `ra` at `[s0-8]`) |
| wasm32    | — (host-managed) | — (traps to the JS harness) |

Active root: aarch64 `TTBR0_EL1`, x86_64 `CR3`, riscv64 `satp`. Non-faulting
translation probe and descriptor walk: aarch64 only (`AT S1E1R`/`AT S1E1W` +
`PAR_EL1`, the one probe the watchdog's stack-link check also uses). A port
without a probe it can run without faulting reports neither rather than
risking a fault inside the fault handler.

wasm32 declares both capabilities an honest `Unsupported`: WebAssembly
exposes no readable register file and no in-memory frame chain, and a panic
traps to the JavaScript harness, which surfaces the host's own stack trace.

## Safety of the unwinder

A stack unwinder that faults on a corrupt chain is a triple fault. The
walker (`tairix_arch_api::backtrace::walk`, one arch-neutral definition
shared by every port) therefore:

- allocates nothing (the panic may itself be a heap failure);
- validates every candidate frame pointer before dereferencing it —
  non-null, 8-byte aligned, strictly greater than the previous one
  (monotonic, which kills cycles), and with both read words wholly inside
  the vouched-for region of the stack the CPU is running on;
- reads memory only through a bounds-checked reader, so the single unsafe
  dereference site lives in one audited place, never one per architecture;
- is hard-capped at 64 frames, so even a corrupt-but-plausible chain
  terminates.

### Which stack is walked, and what it is read through

A walked address is never rebuilt into a pointer. The stack is named by a
`KernelStackRegion`, which carries the *root* whoever established the stack
minted, and every word the unwinder reads is derived from that root at the
validated offset — so the read carries provenance for the bytes it touches
instead of aliasing nothing, and the unwinder can be checked by the
undefined-behaviour oracle rather than merely reasoned about.

Two sources supply the region, in this order:

1. **The running task's stack**, published per-CPU by the dispatcher as it
   switches in (`kthread::running_stack`). This is the case that matters:
   almost every fatal fault after boot lands on a kthread stack, which no
   port can identify, so without it the report would carry registers and no
   frame chain exactly when a chain is most needed.
2. **The port's boot stack** (`CpuStateCapture::boot_stack`), for the
   dispatcher itself and the pre-scheduler boot path.

Neither is believed blind: each answers only when the captured stack
pointer is inside the region it names. That test is also the liveness
proof — a stack pointer inside a region means the CPU is executing on it,
hence that its pages are mapped and that a publication a retired task left
behind cannot be mistaken for the current one. With neither source
vouching, the dump degrades to the registers plus the captured program
counter (`frame_0`) rather than reading memory it cannot guarantee is
mapped. The walker is fuzzed
(`kernel/arch/api/tests/fuzz_backtrace.rs`): it must always terminate and
never read outside the bounds it was given, for any adversarial input.

## The boot stack's guard

The boot stack is in use before the MMU is on, so no page below it can be
unmapped and an overrun cannot be turned into a fault. The linker reserves
a guard immediately beneath it instead, the boot stub fills that guard with
`tairix_memguard`'s sentinel — the same byte the slab and kthread-stack
guards use — and the report reads it back through
`CpuStateCapture::boot_stack_guard`, emitting a `boot_stack_guard` field.
The stub does the fill because it must happen after the `.bss` clear that
spans the guard and before any Rust frame exists on the stack above it; the
sentinel reaches the assembly as a `global_asm!` const operand, so the
poison written and the poison checked for are one definition.

The verdict tests the stack pointer before it reads a byte, for two
reasons. A frame larger than the guard steps over it without disturbing it,
so only the stack pointer catches that case; and a stack pointer that has
descended into the guard means those bytes are live frames, which the check
must not read as though they were poison. So a stack pointer below the
stack's lowest byte reports `sp_below_stack` with the overrun's extent, and
only a stack pointer above it is judged on the canary — `intact`, or
`disturbed` when something wrote through.

Which stack pointer matters: for a panic, the captured one; for a fault, the
one the faulting code ran on (`fault_sp`), never the handler's own — a
vector delivered on an x86_64 IST stack runs on a stack of its own, which
says nothing about the interrupted code's. A fault with no `fault_sp` is
judged on the canary alone. A stack pointer on the stack published for the
task running on that CPU is on that stack, however the stacks are laid out,
so the kernel's post-mortem judges it on the canary too. A stack no registry
names — a secondary CPU's, an interrupt stack, any stack in a test kernel
reported by the port alone — is the verdict's stated limit, and a port's
prose report says so beside an overrun it cannot rule out.

Without this a fault whose real cause was an overrun reads as an
unexplained corruption of whatever happened to sit below the stack, which
is exactly how the defect that motivated the guard presented: the boot hart
ran off its stack into `.bss`, clobbered the console's frame header, and
the machine went silent instead of naming a cause.

## Address-leak policy

Panic dumps print **kernel** addresses deliberately: the event is fatal,
non-recoverable, and halting, so leaking kernel layout to the halted
console is not an exploit vector — the machine is stopping. This is a
different situation from `AuditEvent::TaskFaultKilled`, a *survivable*,
per-task event, which continues to omit the raw *user* faulting address so
a running process cannot probe kernel/user layout through repeated faults.
Panic dumps carry kernel addresses; user-fault kills still do not.

A kernel-fault record's `fault_addr` / `fault_pc` follow the same rule for
the same reason: they are on the halting path, so there is no repeatable
oracle to probe. They are whatever the CPU reported. One edge is worth
naming: a *lower*-EL (user) exception that cannot be attributed to any
running task — no current task, or no published user kthread — is a
kernel-level failure by construction, and falls through to this fatal tail
carrying the user address the CPU latched. A running user task always has
a current task and so always takes the survivable `TaskFaultKilled` path
instead, which still omits its address.

## Resolving addresses offline

The raw `frame_N` / `pc` addresses are resolved against the **unstripped**
kernel ELF (the debug build, or the linker's map for a release build):

```console
# One address:
$ llvm-addr2line -e target/<triple>/debug/tairix-kernel -f -C -i 0xffffffff80001234

# Several at once (paste the frame_N values):
$ llvm-symbolizer --obj=target/<triple>/debug/tairix-kernel \
    0xffffffff80001234 0xffffffff80001300
```

`addr2line` (GNU binutils) works identically. This mirrors Linux's
`scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh` — the kernel prints addresses, the developer
resolves them against the image they built.
