# Kernel entry, init order, and panic policy

This page documents the architecture-neutral kernel core (`kernel/core`),
delivered by Stage 2.6 of [`PLAN.md`](../../../PLAN.md). The crate ships
**three** things and nothing else:

1. The hand-off type `BootInfo` and the `KernelArch` trait an
   architecture port (Stage 3) implements.
2. The single public entry point `kernel_main` that orchestrates
   subsystem init in a fixed, documented order.
3. The panic helper `handle_panic` that an arch port's
   `#[panic_handler]` delegates to.

Everything else (page tables, IPI plumbing, syscall registration, …)
lives elsewhere. `kernel/core` is the contract those layers meet at.

## Entry contract

The arch port's boot stub (Stage 3) is responsible for:

* zeroing BSS,
* setting up an initial stack,
* parsing the platform's boot protocol (multiboot2 / PVH / UEFI / DTB /
  `wasm-bindgen`) into a typed `BootMemoryMap` and `IdentityTableBuilder`,
* constructing a static `log_sink` and `audit_sink`,
* building an `Arc<A: KernelArch>`,
* calling `tairix_kernel_core::kernel_main(boot)`.

`kernel_main` consumes the `BootInfo`, drives the init phases, and
either parks the boot CPU via `KernelArch::halt` on success (Stage 2.7
will replace the trailing halt with the scheduler dispatch loop) or
parks it via `KernelArch::halt` on failure. **The kernel never silently
resets** — that bottom-typed return is the contract (`AGENTS.md` §2).

## Init order

`kernel_main` runs the following phases in this exact order. The order
is the audit contract with external log consumers — re-ordering would
break the boot-timeline they key off (`AGENTS.md` §5.4, §2.4).

| # | Phase   | Subsystem constructed                                                                 |
|---|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | —       | `BootStarted` event emitted; `BootInfo::validate` runs.                               |
| 1 | `log`   | `tairix_log::set_max_level(boot.log_level)`.                                          |
| 2 | `mem`   | The early-boot RAM self-test (`tairix_kernel_core::memtest`, drawing the `TAIRiX <version> <RAM>MiB` line on the boot console) proves every usable region before it is trusted, halting on a fault; then `tairix_kernel_mem::FrameAllocator::new(&boot.memory_map)`. See [the memory page](./memory.md#1a-early-boot-ram-self-test-ramtest). |
| 3 | `sec`   | `boot.identity.verify(boot.audit_sink)` → `IdentityTable`.                            |
| 4 | `sched` | `crate::sched::Scheduler::new(boot.scheduler_config, Arc::clone(&boot.arch))` — the build-time-selected policy (§17.1). |
| 5 | `irq`   | `arch.irq_routing()` returns the architecture-installed `IrqRouting`; the kernel core builds `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::new(routing.max_line)` and stores `routing.controller` in `KernelState`. Immediately after the leak, `arch.install_irq_dispatch(&state.irq)` publishes the `'static` table reference into the arch port's external-IRQ dispatcher slot (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.2). |
| 6 | `syscall` | Production `DispatchHook` published into `boot.dispatcher_callback_slot` (see [Syscall registration phase](#syscall-registration-phase)). |
| 7 | `ipc`   | The named-port `PortRegistry` is composed into `KernelState` (`ipc: RwLock<PortRegistry>`) above and borrowed by the dispatch hook; it boots empty and the phase event fires for timeline uniformity. |
| ∞ | —       | `BootCompleted` event emitted; `arch.halt()` parks the CPU.                           |

Each phase emits exactly:

* one `KERNEL_PHASE_STARTED` record (`EventId(4001)`) with a
  `phase = <name>` field, then
* on success: one `KERNEL_PHASE_READY` record (`EventId(4002)`), or
* on failure: one `KERNEL_PHASE_FAILED` record (`EventId(4003)`)
  carrying both `phase` and `cause` fields, then `arch.halt()`.

The set of stable `cause` strings is enumerated in
`kernel/core/src/init.rs::InitError::cause`.

## Syscall registration phase

Stage 2.7 follow-up (f4) wires the production syscall dispatcher into
`kernel_main`. The phase is the kernel-side publication point for the
callback the arch-port installed before `syscall` was enabled
(`set_dispatch_callback`, `AGENTS.md` §5.4.5 — fail-closed ordering).

   ▼                                                   ▲

  syscall ready  →  ipc started
```

The `Phase::Syscall` step:

1. Builds a `KernelDispatchHook<A>` around `KernelState`'s scheduler,
   capability table, arch port, audit sink, IRQ table/controller,
   named-port registry (`ipc`), per-task address-space registry
   (`aspaces`), the kernel random output reserve (`rng`), and the
   system `console` device (`BootInfo::console`, the discovered
   framebuffer or first UART that backs a process's standard output
   stream, written through the `stream_write` syscall, `AGENTS.md` §20;
   defaults to the fail-closed `NULL_CONSOLE`). The
   `aspaces` registry lets a handler resolve `caller.task_id` to the
   user address space + `PhysMap` the user-memory copy path walks
   (`KernelSyscallHandlers::with_caller_aspace`, `AGENTS.md` §5.4)
   without the decoupled dispatcher gaining a `kernel/mem` dependency
   (§17.4); the `rng` reserve (`tairix_rng::OutputReserve` behind a
   `RandomReserve` trait object) backs `random_get` (`AGENTS.md` §22),
   booting unseeded so a draw fails closed with `EntropyNotReady` until
   the platform-RNG entropy seam (§17.2) re-seeds it.
2. Lifts both the `KernelState` and the hook to `'static` lifetimes
   via `Box::leak` (one-shot publish; the kernel never returns from
   `kernel_main`'s halt). The leak is immutable after publish — not
   a global mutable static; every interior field carries its own
   synchronisation primitive (`Scheduler::tasks`, `RwLock<CapTable>`,
   `RwLock<PortRegistry>`, `RwLock<AddressSpaceRegistry>`,
   `RwLock<Box<dyn RandomReserve>>`).
3. Calls `boot.dispatcher_callback_slot.install_dispatcher(&hook)`.
4. On `Err(AlreadyInstalledError)` (slot already published; programmer
   error), surfaces `InitError::DispatcherAlreadyInstalled`, which the
   standard `PhaseFailed` audit-record path reports under
   `phase = "syscall"`, `cause = "syscall_dispatcher_already_installed"`,
   and halts — no silent recovery.

The arch-level `set_dispatch_callback` is **still** invoked before
`syscall` is enabled on any CPU; this phase is the *kernel-side*
publication point for the hook the eventual production callback (f5)
will read from the slot, not the trampoline.

The slot itself is `pub static DISPATCH_SLOT: DispatchCallbackSlot`
in `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/x86_64/dispatch.rs`: a normal `static` (not
`static mut`) whose set-once publication is protected by an internal
[`OnceCell`](./sync.md). The QEMU integration test
`tairix-test-kernel-arch-boot` reuses the same slot through
`tairix_kernel::boot`.

## Panic policy

The arch port owns the `#[panic_handler]` attribute (host-test builds
cannot define one because `std` already does). It is a one-liner that
delegates to `handle_panic`:

```rust,ignore
#[panic_handler]
fn tairix_panic(info: &core::panic::PanicInfo<'_>) -> ! {
    tairix_kernel_core::handle_panic(info, &PANIC_CTX)
}
```

`PANIC_CTX: PanicContext` is stored in the per-CPU bootstrap area the
arch port owns. Building it once at boot and never mutating it is the
only global-mutable-state exception called out by `AGENTS.md` §2; the
arch port documents it there.

`handle_panic` emits exactly one `KERNEL_PANIC` record (`EventId(4010)`,
`Level::Error`) with the fields below, then calls `KernelArch::halt`.

| Key      | Value                                                |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `cpu`    | Decimal `KernelArch::current_cpu()`.                 |
| `file`   | `info.location().file()` or `"<unknown>"`.           |
| `line`   | Decimal `info.location().line()` or `"0"`.           |
| `column` | Decimal `info.location().column()` or `"0"`.         |

A fatal CPU exception taken in **kernel** mode enters the same body through
`fault_dump`, carrying the arch-neutral `KernelFault { syndrome, address, pc,
sp }` in place of the source position and recorded as `KERNEL_FAULT`
(`EventId(4011)`) with `syndrome` / `fault_addr` / `fault_pc` / `fault_sp`,
each `null` where the CPU gave none. The port's trap path reaches it through
the handler `tairix_kernel::fatal_bridge` installs at boot in the one slot
every port shares (`tairix_arch_api::fault`); with the slot empty the port
writes its own report instead. Both causes share the register snapshot, the
bounded backtrace, and the fatal latch every report path enters first — see
`docs/src/architecture/panic-diagnostics.md`.

Both causes additionally **stop the world** before the record is written:
a kernel invariant is already broken and this CPU cannot resume, so peers
left running would either deadlock on a guard it abandoned or advance over
half-updated state. The report reuses the one cross-CPU stop protocol
(`tairix_arch_api::quiesce`) through its best-effort initiator, and records
`peers_asked` / `peers_stopped` / `peer_unresponsive` — a peer that cannot
answer a pending IPI is wedged with interrupts masked, so naming it is part
of the diagnosis.

Neither handler allocates: every formatting buffer is stack-resident, so
both paths survive a wedged heap.

## `BootInfo` schema

`BootInfo<'a, A: KernelArch>` is `pub`-fielded and consumed by value:

| Field              | Type                              | SAFETY-INVARIANT                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `boot_cpu`         | `CpuId` (`u32`)                   | `== arch.current_cpu()` at entry.             |
| `cpu_count`        | `u32`                             | `>= 1`, `boot_cpu < cpu_count`.               |
| `command_line`     | `&'a str`                         | `len() <= MAX_COMMAND_LINE_BYTES`.            |
| `memory_map`       | `BootMemoryMap`                   | Usable regions are firmware-released RAM.     |
| `identity`         | `IdentityTableBuilder`            | Verified during the `sec` phase.              |
| `scheduler_config` | `SchedulerConfig`                 | `.cpus == cpu_count`.                         |
| `arch`             | `Arc<A>`                          | Pinned for the lifetime of the running kernel.|
| `log_sink`         | `&'static (dyn Sink + Sync)`      | Lives until power-off.                        |
| `audit_sink`       | `&'static (dyn Sink + Sync)`      | Lives until power-off.                        |
| `log_level`        | `tairix_log::Level`               | Installed before the first `PhaseStarted`.    |
| `dispatcher_callback_slot` | `&'static DispatchCallbackSlot`   | Bin-crate-owned slot; receives the production `DispatchHook` during the `syscall` phase. See below. |
| `heap`             | `&'static FreeListAllocator`      | The binary's `#[global_allocator]`. Required rather than installable: only the final binary can declare a global allocator, and the boot path both wires the growable-heap source into it (`mem` phase) and reads its live capacity for `KernelMemoryStats::kernel_heap_bytes`. Handing it over as a parameter is what stops a bin booting with an ungrowable heap (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D69). |
| `consoles`         | `&'static [ConsoleDevice]`        | The installed system console list backing the standard streams (the `stream_write` / `stream_read` syscalls, `AGENTS.md` §20): index 0 the primary console, each further entry an independent console with its own session context (`plans/PI.md` P11). Defaults to the empty fail-closed `NO_CONSOLES` until the arch port installs its discovered list via `with_consoles`. |

`BootInfo::validate()` runs at the top of `kernel_main` and reports any
violation as a `BootInfoError`; the kernel then logs a `PhaseFailed`
record under the `log` phase and halts.

## Audit event catalogue

`kernel/core` owns the `4_000..5_000` event-id range. A `diag` sink means the
record goes to the diagnostic (log/UART) stream rather than the tamper-evident
audit trail, and is compiled in only under the `watchdog-diagnostics` feature:

`PROCESS_SIGNAL_CROSS_PRINCIPAL` is the `signal` syscall's cross-principal
authority decision (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T11). `signal` first tries the
caller's own live children at no capability cost; only once that lookup
comes back "not a child" does the handler consult this rule for a target
owned by another principal — allowed when the target shares the caller's
kernel-attested uid, else only with `CAP_PROC_CONTROL`, else refused. Every
outcome of that consultation emits exactly one record: `Info` when allowed
(`rule` names `same_uid` or `capability`), `Warn` when denied. Each record
carries the caller's task id (`caller`), the target's pid and task id
(`pid`/`target`), the requested `signal`, and the deciding `rule` — never a
capability token or other secret.

`VOLUME_DEGRADED` / `VOLUME_RECOVERING` / `VOLUME_RECOVERED` are the
storage-health audit trail (`plans/FIX-IO.md` IO5). One per-device fold
(`tairix_kernel_core::fs::blkmeter`) keeps a live availability overlay and
every counter the three per-volume `sysinfo` queries report, and both paths a
kernel-side consumer reaches a disk through drive that same fold: the block
client (`BlkClient`) as it posts and reaps each attempt over a serving
endpoint, and `MeteredBlock` around a device the kernel drives itself. The
bootstrap-floor disk is the second case — it has no serving endpoint, so
without that wrapper nothing folded its counters and all three queries
reported nothing at all about the disk the machine is running from
(`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D106). `MeteredBlock` sits directly over the device
and *under* the whole-disk block cache, because a cache hit never reaches the
medium and counting one as device work would report a busy disk that is in
fact idle. The fold emits exactly one record on a genuine *edge* of the
overlay — classified through the one
shared `MountAvailability::health_transition` rule, so a run of identical
completions logs once, not per request. A device reporting itself unwell while
still serving is `VOLUME_DEGRADED` (`Warn`); a device that stalled or reset and
entered its bounded recovery grace window is `VOLUME_RECOVERING` (`Warn`); and a
degraded/recovering volume returning to healthy service — the disk came back —
is `VOLUME_RECOVERED` (`Info`), logged as a recovery rather than a fault. Each
carries `dev` — the device's identity, its block-service endpoint id or its
reserved kernel-driven identity — and never a secret or capability token. Transitions into or out of the surprise-removal vanish states
(`plans/DEVICES.md` D4) carry no health edge here: that path owns its own
records, so a removal is never double-counted and a re-insert never fabricates a
recovery. A user-space block driver that later owns the finer device-level
health machine (retry/reset/grace entry-expiry) emits those in its own
event-id range against the same shared transition vocabulary.

`HW_NODE_REMOVED` / `HW_NODE_REMOVE_REFUSED` are the hardware-tree
retirement pair emitted by `hw_remove_node` (`plans/FIX-IO.md` `IO6f`). A
completed removal is `HW_NODE_REMOVED` (`Info`), carrying the retired `node`
and the `mode` the caller asked for — `surprise` for a device that physically
vanished, `orderly` for a stop-if-idle retirement such as stopping a RAID
array. An orderly removal refused because a volume is still attached on a
block-service endpoint the node declares is `HW_NODE_REMOVE_REFUSED`
(`Warn`, `Errno::Busy`), carrying the `node` left in place: nothing was
removed, so a live mounted volume can never be turned into a
surprise-removal event by an administrator's stop request. The busy check and
the removal happen under a single acquisition of the mount registry's lock, so
an attach cannot land between them. A surprise removal is never refused — a
device that is already gone cannot be kept alive by its volumes — and neither
record carries a capability token or any other secret.

`FS_NODE_MUTATED` / `FS_MUTATION_DENIED` are the filesystem-mutation audit
pair. Every state-changing filesystem syscall — `fs_mkdir`, `fs_unlink`
(recorded as `rmdir` when the directory flag is set, else `unlink`),
`fs_rename`, `fs_symlink`, `fs_set_mode` (`chmod`), and `fs_set_owner`
(`chown`) — emits
exactly one record after the secured VFS decides it under the caller's
kernel-attested identity: `FS_NODE_MUTATED` (`Info`) when the change was
applied, `FS_MUTATION_DENIED` (`Warn`, carrying the refusal's `errno`) when
the VFS refused it and nothing changed (fail closed). Both carry the
operation (`op`), the caller's uid (`uid`), and the target `path`, plus the
operation-specific content that makes the trail actionable: `to` (a rename's
destination), `target` (the path a new symbolic link stores, recorded because
it is what changes how later resolutions behave), `mode` (a chmod's new
permission word, octal), and `owner`/`group` (a chown's new ids). Read-only operations are **not** audited
(only mutations are security-relevant decisions). Paths are bounded to the
log field limit on a character boundary so an over-long path can never make
the record fail to encode and drop — a mutation can never escape the trail.
No capability token or secret is ever placed in a field.

`IRQ_LINE_QUARANTINED` is the runaway-interrupt safety net
(`tairix_kernel_irq`). Under mask-before-wake a bound line can only re-fire
after its user-space driver drains the completion and the kernel re-arms it,
so every legitimate interrupt costs a full user-space round-trip; a line
that instead fires past a generous rate budget (over 100 000 fires in a
one-second window) is re-asserting with no work being done — a wedged or
never-quiesced controller, or a hostile device — and would otherwise peg a
CPU through the mask/wake/re-arm cycle. `IrqTable::fire` counts each line's
fires (using the boot-installed monotonic clock) and, on exceeding the
budget, **quarantines** it: the line is kept masked, no further wake is
delivered, and its `irq_wait` / `waitset_wait` waiter fails closed with
`Errno::DeviceFault`. The record is emitted **once** at that syscall
boundary (task context, so the interrupt-context `fire` path stays
lock-free), naming the `line` and owning `task`; a fresh `irq_bind` clears
the quarantine so a driver can recover the line. This is the kernel's
analogue of Linux's `note_interrupt` spurious-IRQ disable, adapted to the
user-space IRQ model, and is what turns the "mouse driver / xhci pegged at 100%
CPU" storm into a bounded, logged, fail-closed event.

`DMA_QUARANTINED` and `DMA_QUARANTINE_RELEASED` record a dead driver's DMA
memory entering and leaving the quarantine (`kernel/core::dmaquarantine`). The
first is recorded when a driver ends still holding DMA memory its device may
be mastering, naming the `node`, the driver's admission `generation`, and the
`bytes` it leaves — its own carves still live, plus the DMA shared regions it
carved and still maps. The second is recorded with `cause=reset` at every
`dma_quiesced` a later driver of the node makes, even one that freed nothing,
and with `cause=removed` for each surprise-removed node that freed something;
its `bytes` are those returned to the allocator, never a block that stayed
allocated. The two do not pair one for one: memory surrendered after its node
was already released or retired is freed on arrival with no record of its
own, and memory an orderly removal leaves is released only by a reset by a
driver of that node, which in practice never comes. The mechanism and
its ordering rule are in [the memory reference](memory.md) and
[the syscall reference](syscalls.md).

These five records are the first-class CPU-lockup watchdog
(`tairix_kernel_core::watchdog`; design `plans/WATCHDOG.md`), which catches
two distinct failures and carries enough context in each record to explain
*why*.

`CPU_STALL_DETECTED` is a **soft lockup**: a CPU that keeps taking
interrupts but stops returning to the scheduler (a runaway in-kernel loop, a
task that never yields, a lock held across a wedged access). It is emitted
the first time the CPU's own armed preemption tick
(`watchdog::check_stall`), or another CPU's cross-CPU scan, observes a
dispatch-loop heartbeat (`watchdog::note_progress`) older than
`watchdog::DEFAULT_SOFT_LOCKUP_THRESHOLD_NS` (10 s). `CPU_STALL_CLEARED` (a
`Warn`) closes the record when that CPU dispatches again.

`CPU_HARD_LOCKUP_DETECTED` is a **hard lockup**: a CPU that has stopped
taking even interrupts (spinning with IRQs masked, wedged, an interrupt
storm). Its own tick never fires, so only *another* CPU can observe it — via
the non-maskable ~1 Hz cadence sample each CPU runs
(`watchdog::on_watchdog_tick`), which stamps a liveness heartbeat and scans
the other CPUs; a buddy whose liveness is stale past
`DEFAULT_HARD_LOCKUP_THRESHOLD_NS` (10 s) while Active is reported.
`CPU_HARD_LOCKUP_CLEARED` (a `Warn`) closes the record when that CPU takes
its sample again.

For that to mean "wedged" rather than merely "busy", the cadence must be
deliverable everywhere a healthy CPU can be — including while it runs a
user task. Where a port delivers the cadence as a genuinely non-maskable
interrupt (aarch64's Group-0/FIQ debug sampler), user mode therefore runs
with that interrupt *unmasked* (`userentry::el0_spsr`): a core executing a
CPU-bound user task takes its sample in EL0 and keeps its liveness
heartbeat fresh. Leaving it masked in user mode made the heartbeat rot
while the task ran and reported a hard lockup against a demonstrably
healthy core, with every stale field (`k_site`, `k_bt`, `k_lock`) pointing
at the unrelated kernel entry it was last sampled in.

A detection carries the full diagnosis, never secrets: `cpu` (the locked
CPU), `observer` (the CPU that caught a cross-CPU lockup), `stalled_ms` (how
long it has been silent), and — from the last-known context each cadence
sample records — `pc` (interrupted program counter), `pstate` (interrupted
processor state), and `context` (`kernel` or `user`, the most decisive clue
for the "why"). A hard lockup's recorded sample is, by definition, the one
taken *before* the CPU went silent, so it names the innocent code the CPU
last returned to rather than the wedge: the record marks it
`sampled=pre_silence`, and the observer reads the interrupt controller's
globally-shared state live to name the device line actually stuck —
`stuck_irq=<id>`, the lowest shared line stuck active over merely pending —
through the Arch-HAL query `WatchdogArch::stuck_interrupt` (aarch64: the
lowest *deliverable* GICv2 SPI). Only a line that could still reach a CPU is
ever reported: a masked line cannot be delivered, so it can never be the
wedge, and the observer skips it rather than blaming an innocent line — an
active line is reported unconditionally (being active proves it was
delivered), while a pending line is reported only when it is still enabled.
The `stuck_state=<active|pending>` flag then distinguishes a live storm
(`active`, a handler in flight) from an enabled line asserted but not yet
taken (`pending`) — both genuine, deliverable suspects. The raw id still
does not say *whose* device the line is, so the
record attributes it two ways. First against the live kernel IRQ table
(`IrqTable::owner_of_line`): `stuck_owner=<task>` names the driver that bound
the line. A line with no driver binding is then offered to the port's
kernel-internal line-name resolver (`KernelArch::watchdog_line_names`), so a
line the kernel services *itself* through a chained or bespoke handler —
which by construction has no `irq_wait` binding — is **named** rather than
dismissed: aarch64 reports `stuck_owner=pcie-msi` for the BCM2711 PCIe
root-complex MSI multiplexer's shared SPI (the USB/PCIe MSI line a wedged CPU
could not service) and `stuck_owner=console-uart` for the console UART
receive line, both matched against interrupt numbers discovered from the
device tree, never board constants. Only a line neither a driver nor the
kernel owns is `stuck_owner=unbound` — a genuinely spurious or contained
line, so the wedge is elsewhere (this is what tells a raw `stuck_irq=111`
apart from the USB path). `stuck_owner` is omitted when the owner cannot be
resolved (no resolver installed), so a record never claims an attribution it
could not make. `stuck_irq` /
`stuck_state` / `stuck_owner` are omitted when no line is stuck (a pure
IRQ-masked in-kernel spin), and a soft lockup — whose sample is live —
carries none of them. Every episode is reported **once**, never once per
tick, and self-closes on recovery.

One class of hard wedge is *invisible* to `stuck_irq` by construction: a
software-generated interrupt (an SGI — the cross-CPU reschedule IPI) that is
never completed leaves the CPU-interface running priority raised, blocking
every further interrupt on that core, yet SGI/PPI state is banked per CPU
and so cannot be read by the observing CPU (`stuck_irq` scans only the
globally-visible SPI range). This was a real defect: `gic::acknowledge`
returned only the `GICC_IAR` INTID field, dropping the SGI source-CPU bits
`[12:10]`, so `handle_irq` wrote a `GICC_EOIR` value the GICv2 spec does not
accept as the completion of an SGI raised by a non-zero source CPU — that
IPI never deactivated and the receiving core wedged under IPI-heavy load.
The acknowledge/end-of-interrupt handshake now carries the **full** IAR
value end to end (dispatch masks it to the INTID only for the handler
decision), so an SGI from any CPU is completed correctly.

Because no observer can ever read a banked line's state, the *victim*
publishes it instead: each CPU records the interrupt it acknowledged into its
own per-CPU slot on entry and clears it at the end-of-interrupt (two relaxed
stores, off any lock, no change to delivery or completion ordering). A
hard-lockup detail then renders `in_flight` beside `stuck_irq`, so a core
wedged inside an SGI or PPI names that interrupt instead of being reported
against whatever device line happened to be pending. The field distinguishes
"nothing in flight" from "in flight, intid N" and from "no reading taken", so
it never implies an observation it did not make.

The breadcrumb, backtrace, and sampled `pc`/`pstate` described next are a
**debug-only** facility, compiled in only under the `watchdog-diagnostics`
Cargo feature that `tools/xtask` enables for the non-shippable `debug` image
and leaves fully out of the shippable `installer` image — so a released
kernel pays nothing for them on the hot paths and discloses no kernel
address. The lockup **summary** (`CpuHardLockupDetected` /
`CpuStallDetected`) is always-on and goes to the persistent audit log, but
carries only non-disclosing state — `cpu`, `observer`, `stalled_ms`, the
`task` id, `context` (`kernel`/`user`), `sampled`, and `stuck_*` — never a
kernel address. The address-bearing **detail** below is a separate
`CpuLockupDiagnostic` record emitted to the diagnostic (log/UART) stream,
never the tamper-evident audit trail, and every kernel address in it is
rendered **image-base-relative** (`pc=+0x…`, `k_bt=+0x…`), never the
absolute runtime address — the `%pK`/`kptr_restrict` discipline, so a
capture resolves against the debug kernel ELF without revealing the
KASLR-relocatable load base.

How much of such a record to believe depends on whether the port's
non-maskable self-sample is actually live on this boot, which the port decides
at run time from a delivery probe. That verdict is reported once, on the boot
CPU, as `CpuWatchdogSelfSample` (`self_sample=live`, or `unsupported`/`pending`
with the reason the honesty verdict carries), so a reader of a later
`sampled=pre_silence` record can tell an image whose sampler was working from
one where it never ran. It carries no address and no secret — it is a
capability statement.

A `context=kernel`/`user` reading is only as fresh as the sample that recorded
it, so a report marks it `sampled=pre_silence` whenever the last sample is
older than the cadence interval. That binds the CPU's *own* timer-tick stall
report too: the maskable tick keeps firing on a core whose non-maskable cadence
has stopped, and without the marker such a report printed a confident
`context=kernel` from a field ten seconds out of date.

Because a hard lockup's sampled `pc` is `pre_silence` — and on a board with
no non-maskable channel (the Raspberry Pi 4's GICv2 in the non-secure
world) a CPU wedged with interrupts masked can be reached by neither its own
watchdog sample nor a buddy's IPI — the debug detail also carries a **kernel
breadcrumb** the target CPU publishes *itself* as it runs, through
`watchdog::note_kernel_breadcrumb`. It is stamped on the way *into* each
in-kernel region so it stays fresh through a wedge and names the region the
CPU is actually stuck in, where the stale sampled `pc` cannot. The
`dispatch` macro-region is partitioned finely, because a scheduler-time
wedge otherwise reports only the coarse `dispatch`: the scheduler's own
pick/steal machinery keeps `dispatch`; the task-body shim hand-off (a user
kthread's `pre_resume` address-space reactivation, resume/live publication)
is `task_body`; the arch context switch into a **user** task and its
execution up to its first trap is `user_switch`, while the switch into a
**kernel** kthread and that kthread's whole body run — which never leaves EL1,
so no trap ever re-stamps the crumb — is `kernel_body`; the dispatcher-side
teardown *after* the switch returns — retiring the resume handle and, for a
user kthread, parking this CPU's translation off the task's user root (a
translation-register write) and checking the guard, all with device interrupts
still masked — is `switch_return`; and the post-run accounting tail (also
masked, inherited from the suspending task's exception entry) is
`dispatch_tail`. Splitting `switch_return` from `user_switch` tells a wedge
coming *back* from a task (notably the user-root translation park) apart from
one going *into* it — both otherwise-invisible IRQ-masked sections on a GICv2
board. Splitting `kernel_body` from `user_switch` matters for a different
reason: a stall reported against a kernel-context sample means a long
in-kernel service body under `kernel_body` but a task executing *user* code
under `user_switch`, and one tag covering both sent a reader hunting a
misbehaving user program while the CPU was in fact inside a kernel service.
The full `k_site` set is `dispatch` / `task_body` / `user_switch` /
`kernel_body` / `switch_return` / `dispatch_tail` / `syscall` (before any
handler work) / `fault_entry` / `fault_reclaim` / `fault_stack` /
`fault_ramzip` / `fault_anon` / `fault_file` / `fault_fatal`; `k_detail` is
the syscall number, the faulting virtual address for a fault phase, or the
dispatched task id for `task_body` / `dispatch_tail` (`0` for `user_switch`,
`kernel_body` and `switch_return`, whose task id is carried by the preceding
`task_body` crumb); and `k_seq` is
a per-CPU sequence, so two successive reports tell a frozen breadcrumb —
stuck in exactly this region — from an advancing one. The breadcrumb is
three relaxed stores plus one release bump, the same order of cost as the
progress/liveness heartbeats already on those paths, and carries no secret;
`k_*` is omitted when the CPU has recorded no region (a lone user task).

The record also carries the **pre-silence backtrace** `k_bt` — the
frame-pointer-unwound return-address chain (`k_bt=<pc0>,<pc1>,…`, innermost
first, starting at the interrupted PC) of the context the CPU's *last*
watchdog sample interrupted. Where the lone stale `pc` names only one
ambiguous address, `k_bt` names the whole call nest the CPU was in ~1 s
before it went silent. Each port captures it on every cadence sample by
unwinding the interrupted register frame; the aarch64 port
(`watchdog::capture_sample_backtrace`) walks the AAPCS64 `x29` chain of the
CPU's stack, **bounded and fail-closed** (it stops at a null or misaligned
frame pointer, a frame pointer not strictly above the exception frame (the
stack floor) or not strictly increasing, a zero return address, **a return
address outside the kernel's executable text**, a full buffer, or a hard
step cap). The text-range check (`in_kernel_text`, over the
`__text_start`/`__text_end` linker bounds) is what makes the chain
*trustworthy* — it rejects a stack **data** word misread as a caller, so the
walk no longer emits plausible-looking but bogus frames. The pure
`walk_frames` core is host-tested with an injected fake stack; the arch
wrapper supplies the real map-probe, frame read, and text-range predicate.
It also proves each frame-pointer link is mapped with an `AT S1E1R`
read-translation check *before* dereferencing it, so it never faults on
**any** stack — not even one whose interrupted context left a stale or
garbage `x29`, e.g. early-boot assembly or a task entry trampoline — and
never loops. It is captured only for a sample that
interrupted **kernel** code
(a hard lockup is always an in-kernel wedge; confining the walk to the
kernel stack keeps it off an untrusted user stack), stored per-CPU through
`watchdog::note_watchdog_backtrace` (length published last, release), and
rendered by the buddy observer with each frame image-base-relative (`+0x…`,
via `image_relative`). `k_bt` is omitted when the port captured no frames,
and any frame that does not resolve against the registered image base is
skipped rather than disclosed raw (fail closed — never a fabricated stack,
never an absolute address).

The record also names the **stuck spinlock** `k_lock`. On a GICv2 board with
no non-maskable channel a hard lockup is, by construction, a core spinning on
or holding an `IrqSafeSpinLock` with interrupts masked — the one thing the
maskable liveness sample cannot observe from *inside*. So in a diagnostics
build the spinning lock family
(`SpinLock::{lock,try_lock}`, which `IrqSafeSpinLock` wraps) is
`#[track_caller]` and reports its acquire/hold/release lifecycle — with the
acquiring call's **source `file:line`** — through the `lib/sync` `lockwatch`
seam to an observer `kernel/core` installs, which records each core's current
lock into a per-CPU bounded stack (`CpuState::lock_sites`). The buddy's report
renders the innermost entry as `k_lock=<file>` + `k_lock_line` + `k_lock_state`
(`acquiring` = still spinning/contended; `held` = wedged inside the section).
The recorded value is a source string, so no runtime (KASLR-relocatable)
address is disclosed even though it is a pointer internally; `k_lock` is
omitted when the core holds no recorded lock. A shippable build compiles the
whole facility out (the `lock-diagnostics` feature, off), so a production lock
is a bare compare-and-swap. `RwLock` reports the same lifecycle: it is
writer-preference, so a reader that blocks behind a registered writer can wedge
indefinitely, and without a site the report names only whatever spinlock the
core happened to be holding — a stale crumb that points at the wrong code.
`McsLock` is not instrumented: it does not mask interrupts and hands the lock
on in queue order, so a wedge there is a soft lockup the live `pc`/`k_bt`
already localise.

Read `k_lock` for what it is: the innermost lock the core had *recorded*, not
a verdict. Where the port's non-maskable FIQ self-sample is live
(`plans/WATCHDOG.md`) an `IrqSafeSpinLock` hold leaves `DAIF.F` clear and so
stays sampleable, which means a lock wedge there is *not* silent — a
`k_lock_state=held` beside a `pre_silence` sample then names the section the
core was inside when it went silent, and the wedge itself lies elsewhere (a
never-retired interrupt, or a return-state corruption that turns into a
recursive `DAIF`-masked fault). `k_lock_state=acquiring` is the contended-lock
verdict; `held` is context.

The record also carries a **fresh cross-core PC** `live_pc` when the port can
read one. A hard lockup's own `pc`/`k_bt` are stale (`pre_silence`), and on a
GIC whose non-maskable interrupt belongs to the secure world (the Raspberry Pi
4 GIC-400) no interrupt can even reach the wedged core. Where the silicon
exposes the ARMv8 external-debug PC Sample Register (`EDPCSR`), the buddy
observer reads the victim's PC over that memory-mapped debug interface —
without halting it and over a channel `DAIF` cannot mask — through
`WatchdogArch::remote_pc_sample`, and renders it image-relative as
`live_pc=+0x…` (plus `live_ctx`, the sampled context register) *alongside* the
stale `pc`, so a reader sees the instruction the core is actually wedged on.
The aarch64 port implements it in `coresight` (host-tested unlock/validity/
capture logic over a `DebugMmio` seam; per-cpu debug bases discovered from the
device tree's `arm,coresight-cpu-debug` binding and installed only for an
already-Device-mapped window, so the read never faults). A port with no such
channel — or a tree that describes no debug components — answers
`RemotePcSample::Unsupported` and the report keeps the stale sample (fail
closed, never a fabricated PC). `live_pc` is a debug-only field; a user-EL
sample (not a kernel-image address) is omitted rather than disclosed raw.

`CPU_LOCKUP_RECOVERY` (a `Warn`) records the best-effort recovery the
watchdog asked the architecture port for after a detection
(`WatchdogArch::request_recovery`): fields `cpu`, `kind` (`soft`/`hard`),
and `outcome` (`rescheduled` / `attention` / `unrecoverable` /
`unsupported`), so the attempt and its honest result are on the trail — a
port with no recovery channel records `unsupported` rather than silently
doing nothing.

Detection, reporting, and recovery are lock-free and allocation-free, so
they run safely from the non-maskable sample path — the one place a hard
lockup is observable — even while a target CPU holds arbitrary locks.
Before the report/recovery/clock hooks are installed, or on a CPU whose
heartbeats have never been stamped, the watchdog stays silent (fail
closed): it never fabricates a lockup and never panics.

`INPUT_DELIVERED` is the one-shot input-path witness (`AGENTS.md` §18.3 /
§20, `plans/PI.md` P11). The `key_inject`, `pointer_inject` and
`touch_inject` syscall handlers emit it the first time a record of their kind
is successfully delivered to the seat registry (`tairix_kernel_core::seat`),
with a `kind` field (`key` / `pointer` / `touch`), each gated by its own
one-shot latch (`SeatRegistry::note_first_delivery`) so it fires at most once
per kind over the kernel's lifetime — proof that an (autoloaded) driver of
that class has come up and is routing input. It carries **no** content, count, or timing: a
per-keystroke record would leak typed secrets and their cadence and is
forbidden (`AGENTS.md` §20 — no input-content/timing noise on the log;
§23.1 — secret hygiene).

The `SEAT_*` pair records the `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` seat administration
(`plans/DISPLAY.md` D3): `SEAT_SWITCHED` is emitted by the `seat_switch`
handler after a validated foreground retarget (fields: `seat`, `console`),
and `SEAT_LEASE_REVOKED` by the `seat_revoke` handler after a forced
eviction (fields: `seat`, `evicted` — the evicted owner's task id, so
every eviction is attributable). Refused calls emit no seat event; the
dispatcher's own denial records cover them.

The `USERS_DB_*` pair reports the boot-time users-database load
(`tairix_kernel_core::users::load_users_db`, `plans/PI.md` P11): given the
mounted root volume's `FilesystemRead` + `FilesystemSecurity` driver, the
kernel resolves `/System/Security/Users` through the VFS's §5.3-checked
per-inode delegation (`Vfs::read_via_secured`, with the root mount backed
by the volume's driver), bounds the file against the format's 64 KiB
maximum *before* reading it, and parses it through the fail-closed
`tairix-users` parser. The read runs under the kernel's bootstrap identity
— `uid 0`, no capabilities, no bypass (`AGENTS.md` §5.1) — and any refusal
leaves the system with **no** database, so every login refuses
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4.5). The `users_db_qemu_aarch64` vertical proves the path
end to end on the QEMU `virt` board against a real (emulated) virtio-blk
users-root volume.

A boot path that mounts the root volume installs the loaded database into
the production dispatch hook through one kernel-neutral seam (the §17.4
boundary between the architecture-neutral install policy and the
board-specific storage bring-up that *produces* the mounted driver).
`tairix_kernel_core::users::load_users_db_source` shares that exact read,
parse, and `USERS_DB_*` audit path with `load_users_db` (`AGENTS.md` §2.2)
but retains the validated `users-v1` *text* in a `HeldUsersDbSource` — the
canonical bytes the `users_db_read` syscall serves verbatim, never a
re-serialisation. The boot path `Box::leak`s that holder and hands it to
`BootInfo::with_users_db`; `kernel_main` threads it into the
`KernelDispatchHook` so `users_db_read` serves it to a `CAP_USERS_READ`
caller. The held bytes are salted credential records: the holder zeroes
them on drop (`AGENTS.md` §4) and its `Debug` is redacted (length only).
Until a boot path calls `with_users_db`, the handover keeps the
fail-closed `NULL_USERS_DB` default and `users_db_read` returns
`NotImplemented`, so login refuses every attempt rather than inventing
accounts (`AGENTS.md` §5.4.5).

The composition that *produces* the mounted driver `load_users_db_source`
reads from is `tairix_kernel::root_mount::unlock_root_and_load_users`
(`plans/PI.md` P11, Chunk A) — the one layer permitted to name both the
`arxfs` driver and `kernel/core` (`tairix-kernel`, `Layer::Tooling`,
`AGENTS.md` §17.4). Given the plaintext `root.unlock` key-derivation
descriptor read off the FAT boot partition, the passphrase the operator
typed at the console, and the encrypted root block device, it: decodes the
descriptor fail-closed (`UnlockDescriptor::decode`, §5.4.3); derives the
volume key from the passphrase (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256), holding it in a
`Zeroizing` wrapper so it is wiped on drop (`AGENTS.md` §4 — the audited
`zeroize` crate, no hand-rolled primitive); mounts the encrypted root
(`ARXFS::open`), a wrong passphrase refused with `PermissionDenied` and no
plaintext fallback (§4 / §5.4); then runs `load_users_db_source`. Every
refusal is audited (the bin-crate ids in the shared `4_000` range; no
passphrase, key, or volume byte is ever logged, §19.4) and yields **no**
database, so a root that cannot be unlocked serves none (§5.4.5). A
**structural** refusal — an unreadable/invalid descriptor, a
missing/malformed partition table or partition, a non-arxfs volume, or a
device fault — is the ERROR-level `4134` `ROOT_MOUNT_REJECTED`. A **wrong
passphrase** is not a system error: it is recorded as the below-`Info`
`4142` `ROOT_UNLOCK_KEY_REJECTED` (`Debug`), so the silent blank-passphrase
probe of a non-blank image — which fails on *every* normal boot (§11) — and
routine interactive retries cannot flood the boot log, while the record
stays available for brute-force forensics when the level is lowered
(`AGENTS.md` §2.1 / §19.4).

The first of those three inputs — the plaintext `root.unlock`
key-derivation descriptor — is recovered off the FAT boot partition by
`tairix_kernel::root_mount::read_root_unlock_descriptor`, which mounts the
partition through the **same** real FAT32 driver `tools/mkimage` authored
it with (one on-disk definition for writer and reader, `AGENTS.md` §2.2;
the file name is the shared `tairix_drv_fs_arxfs::ROOT_UNLOCK_NAME`
constant). The descriptor is a fixed-length record, so the read is strictly
bounded and fail-closed (§5.4 / §24.4): the entry's size is checked to be
exactly `UNLOCK_DESCRIPTOR_LEN` *before* a byte is read — rejecting both a
truncated and an over-long file — and the bytes are still re-validated by
`UnlockDescriptor::decode` before they drive any key derivation (§5.4.3).

`tairix_kernel::root_mount::mount_root_and_load_users` is the single
boot-path entry that ties those two halves together: given the brought-up
FAT boot-partition and encrypted-root block devices and the typed
passphrase, it reads the descriptor (`read_root_unlock_descriptor`) and,
on success, threads it straight into `unlock_root_and_load_users`, so the
boot path neither re-threads the descriptor buffer nor reconciles two
error taxonomies itself (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). A descriptor that cannot be
read off the boot partition is audited (`4134` `ROOT_MOUNT_REJECTED`) and
returned as `RootMountError::DescriptorRead` — the encrypted root is never
touched and no database is served (§2.9 / §5.4.5).

`ROOT_STORAGE_AUTOLOAD` (the bin-crate id `4135`, in the shared `4_000`
range) reports the **root-storage bind gate**
(`tairix_kernel::root_storage`, `AGENTS.md` §18.3 / §18.6, `plans/PI.md`
P11 Chunk B-2) — the storage analogue of the keyboard bind gate. As the
aarch64 boot path enters the kernel core it walks the discovered hardware
tree and resolves which node carries the bootstrap root block device
against the in-kernel floor catalogue (`tairix_kernel::driver_catalog`),
through the **same** shared `lib/devmatch` policy the user-space `devmgr`
autoloader uses: the kernel binds a block driver because that driver's
signed bind table matched a discovered node, never because it *hunted* for
a disk (§18.5). A device behind a bus that must be *probed* — a virtio-blk
disk, whose bind key is the virtio device id read from the transport, not a
`compatible` string — appears only after a bus enumeration attaches the
probed child node (§18.2). On the QEMU `virt` board the boot path closes
that gap with a **bootstrap-floor virtio-MMIO enumeration**
(`tairix_kernel::hwdiscovery::observe_virtio_mmio_block_devices`): it reads
each `virtio,mmio` slot's `DeviceID` through the MMIO bus driver and folds a
probed virtio-block child node (keyed by the genuine probed device id, never
a fabricated key) into the same selection, so a discovered virtio-blk root
binds exactly as a directly-described EMMC2 node does. The Raspberry Pi 4
tree carries no `virtio,mmio` node, so the probe is a no-op there and the
metal boot is unaffected (§2.17). The record names the bound driver path,
the node id, and the bind priority; a tree with no block device leaves the
root unbound (informational, §18.4), and a tree with more than one distinct
block device fails closed as ambiguous (`Error`) rather than guessing which
volume is the root (§2.9). The gate is **resolution only** — it mounts
nothing — so it changes no boot behaviour beyond the audit record and the
metal-confirmed boot is unaffected (§2.17).

The same `virtio,mmio` enumeration also discovers **user-space-autoloadable
input devices** (`tairix_kernel::hwdiscovery::observe_virtio_mmio_input_devices`,
§18.2 / §18.3). A virtio keyboard/pointer is driven entirely from user space
(§4 — drivers in user space), so unlike the in-kernel bootstrap-floor block
path (whose bring-up re-derives the slot window from the device tree by
base) an input node **must** carry both its register window *and* a DMA
constraint as `HwResource`s — a user-space virtio driver maps its registers
and drives its split virtqueues out of driver-allocated DMA memory, so a node
that requested no DMA would be discovered yet fail its queue bring-up closed.
The slot whose `DeviceID` is virtio-input (`18`) is emitted as a discovered
`HwDeviceClass::Input` node keyed by the probed `HwMatchKey::virtio(18)` and
carrying `HwResource::mmio(base, len)` over the slot's discovered base and the
extent the device tree's `reg` pair declares (`VirtioMmioBus::slot_window`,
§18.1 — a discovered value, never a literal) **plus** a coherent
`HwResource::dma` (the QEMU `virt` virtio interconnect is cache-coherent with
no IOMMU, so the device addresses all of RAM — no address limit, never a board
constant, §18.5). The privileged driver-spawn path mints exactly one
device-resource grant per resource the matched node requested, so the
user-space driver the `devmgr` autoload binds to that node is handed a window
grant of precisely the slot it owns and a DMA grant for its virtqueues — and
nothing more (§18.3 / §4 — no ambient authority). The discovered node is also
parented to the tree root id (`HW_NODE_ROOT_ID`), never the `HW_NODE_ROOT`
parent sentinel, so the autoload walk treats it as a device rather than
skipping it as a root (`HwNode::is_root`). A slot whose window extent cannot
be resolved (a malformed `reg`) is skipped rather than emitted on a partial
identity (fail closed, §2.9). The Pi 4 tree carries no `virtio,mmio` node, so
this too is a no-op there (§2.17).

`tairix_kernel::root_mount::unlock_root_disk_interactively` is the
device-independent **interactive unlock policy** the in-kernel unlock
kthread runs once the board has brought up the root block device and the
console keyboard is live (`plans/PI.md` P11 Chunk B-2). It is generic over
the `Block` disk and takes the console write/read halves as the object-safe
`tairix_kernel_core::{ConsoleWrite, ConsoleRead}` seams, so it names no
architecture or device type (§17.4) and is host-tested with a mock console
over the same MBR + encrypted-`ARXFS` disk fixture `tools/mkimage` writes
(§2.2). It tries the **blank** passphrase silently *first*, before drawing
any prompt: the installer image is provisioned with a blank root passphrase
(`tairix_mkimage::INSTALLER_PASSPHRASE`, §11), so a fresh install unlocks and
boots straight into the §11 installer with no `ARXFS passphrase:`
prompt at all. Only when the blank passphrase does not unlock the root (a debug image —
passphrase `root` — or a production image with an operator-chosen passphrase)
is the operator prompted interactively; a non-blank passphrase failing the
silent attempt is no oracle (the master key simply never unwraps, exactly as
for any wrong passphrase, §5.4). Each interactive attempt prompts
`ARXFS passphrase:`, reads one line into a zeroized, fixed-length
on-stack buffer (`MAX_PASSPHRASE_LEN`; the secret never reaches the heap, a log, or
memory beyond the attempt, §4 / §19.4), and runs
`mount_root_disk_and_load_users`. On success (silent or prompted) the loaded
database is published into the set-once `LateUsersDb` cell through the shared
`finish_install` helper (`4136` `ROOT_UNLOCK_INSTALLED`) so login can
authenticate. A wrong passphrase
(`Mount(PermissionDenied)`) is audited (`4137` `ROOT_UNLOCK_RETRY`, no
oracle), rate-limited by a minimum three-second timed park
(`tairix_kernel::unlock_service::park_for_ns`, never a busy-wait) so a
scripted brute-force gains no faster signal than the operator, then reported
(`Incorrect passphrase`) and prompted **again — indefinitely**: the
encrypted root holds the only copy of the user data and login is refused
until it mounts, so there is nothing to advance to without the correct
passphrase and no bounded "give up" that would help. Only a *structural*
error the disk itself cannot satisfy (no table, no boot/root partition, an
unreadable/invalid descriptor, a corrupt database) or a console read fault
gives up; every give-up path (`4138` `ROOT_UNLOCK_GAVE_UP`, with a
secret-free `cause`) leaves the cell empty, so every login is refused until
the next boot (§2.9 / §5.4.5). On a *successful* unlock the prompt line is
collapsed in place to just the filesystem label `ARXFS` (a carriage return,
the label, and an erase-to-end-of-line clear the typed secret and its
completed-input marker off the tail) followed by a blank line, so the login
`Username:` that follows is cleanly separated.

The `&'static LateUsersDb` dispatch-hook half is wired: the boot path hands
the syscall dispatch hook `&tairix_kernel::root_mount::LATE_USERS_DB`
through `BootInfo::with_users_db`, so `users_db_read` reads that one
set-once cell on every call. The cell is a **three-state** machine, because
design B spawns `login` *before* the unlock kthread mounts the root and
prompts for the passphrase on the **same** console: while the unlock is
still running the read returns `WouldBlock`, so `login` waits without
printing `Username:` and the unlock owns the console (the two prompts never
collide); the trusted unlock step publishes the mounted database into the
*same* cell via `LateUsersDb::install` (`4136` `ROOT_UNLOCK_INSTALLED`) so
the next read serves it; and every fail-closed / no-disk path calls
`LateUsersDb::resolve`, flipping the read to `NotImplemented` (exactly the
`NULL_USERS_DB` default) so `login` stops waiting and runs its deny-all
prompt (§5.4.5). `resolve` is paired with opening the console-0 gate
through one `release_console0_to_login` helper so they can never diverge
(§2.2), and the metal-confirmed boot is unaffected (§2.17).

The board-specific bring-up that *supplies* the block device and drives this
policy is wired into the boot path (`plans/PI.md` P11 Chunk B-2): the init
seam admits the in-kernel root-unlock kthread
(`tairix_kernel::unlock_service::spawn_if_present`), which brings the bound
block driver up through an in-kernel block DriverHost behind the signed §8
load gate over the production device-IRQ path, prompts on the primary
console, runs `unlock_root_disk_interactively`, and (through the one
`release_console0_to_login` helper) opens the console-0 ownership gate and
resolves the `LateUsersDb` cell so a `login` parked on the pending
(`WouldBlock`) read takes over. To deliver those device interrupts the
production aarch64 boot runs **interrupt-driven**: the `irq` phase brings the
GICv2 up (`gic::init`, via `gic_irq::install_device_irq_dispatch`), the
kthread binds the device SPI on the core-published `IrqTable`, and its waiter
parks on a race-free `wfi` (`exceptions::{mask_irq, wait_for_interrupt,
enable_irq}`). The virtio-MMIO transport acknowledges its own device
interrupt (`InterruptStatus` → `InterruptACK`, virtio 1.1 §4.2.2) after each
completion so a stale edge cannot mis-pair back-to-back reads, and the
service's mount / install / give-up decisions route onto the audit channel
(`InitSpawnCtx::static_audit`, §19.4).

The kthread dispatches on which floor block driver bound: **virtio-blk**, or
the Raspberry Pi 4 **EMMC2** SD host. A virtio-MMIO disk is brought up by the
one sequence both device-tree ports share (`floor_mmio::bring_up_virtio_mmio`):
it claims the node for the kernel, carves its DMA through the kernel's own
domain where a unit translates it, refuses a slot that does not snoop before
its line is bound, then binds and arms the slot's interrupt. A port supplies
only what its silicon decides (`MmioFloorPort`): its bookkeeping page tables,
the maps registers and frames are reached through, and where its devices take
their interrupts. The x86_64 virtio-PCI disk is brought up by `x86_64::floor`
instead. Every floor device's interrupt, EMMC2's included, is bound through
`floor_irq::LineHost`, which configures a wired line's trigger while it is
still masked and unbinds a line it cannot arm. Every virtio disk is then
admitted at the signed load gate and opened by `finish_virtio_unlock`; it and
EMMC2 share the mount, the pre-unlock `/System` autoload, and the interactive
unlock (`finish_unlock`).
EMMC2
is interrupt-driven and uses ADMA2 DMA: it
maps the matched node's sole SDHCI register window under `CAP_MMIO_MAP`
through a minimal in-kernel MMIO-only DriverHost, carves a staging slab
from a `CAP_MEM_DMA`-gated `Emmc2DmaHost`, and brings the card up over
the host-proven `tairix-drv-storage-emmc2` engine.

`virtio-blk` proves it end to end on `-M virt`: the `root_unlock_login`
vertical drives the unlock *policy* directly, and the `root_unlock_admission`
vertical boots the *production* pipeline (`boot_aarch64::boot`) with a planted
virtio-blk disk so the bootstrap-floor enumeration binds the root, the kthread
is admitted, and it mounts the root + installs the database — the install is
the vertical's PASS witness on the audit channel. Driving the per-console
`login` to authenticate `root`/`root` end to end additionally needs the
userland heap to parse the served database (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5b); the
database *content* authenticating `root`/`root` is proven by
`root_unlock_login`. The EMMC2 arm is wired into this same path; `raspi4b`
cannot model EMMC2 (`plans/PI.md` §0.4 / P8 / B4), so it is host-tested at
the driver level and its live bring-up is metal-gated.

`DRIVER_STORE_SCANNED` reports the boot-time enumeration of the
`/System/Drivers/` signed-driver store
(`tairix_kernel_core::driver_store::enumerate_driver_store`, `AGENTS.md`
§18.3 / §18.6, `plans/PI.md` P10 Stage 4.HW item 5 / design B). Mirroring
the users-database read, it walks a mounted volume's `FilesystemRead` +
`FilesystemSecurity` driver under the uid-0 bootstrap identity (no §5.1
bypass), starting at a `store_root` taken relative to that volume's own root
(`DRIVER_STORE_PATH` on a whole-root volume; `SYSTEM_VOLUME_STORE_PATH`,
`/Drivers`, on the design-B read-only `/System` volume scanned before
unlock), collecting the image path of every regular file beneath it — the
candidate paths the user-space scan
(`tairix_drvhost::store::scan_store`) reads, bind-decodes, and hands to the
`devmgr` autoloader. It only finds paths; it never reads, parses, or trusts
a bundle — the load gate (`tairix_drvhost::Host::load`) verifies a bundle
only when it wins a node (§18.6). The walk is bounded
(`MAX_STORE_DEPTH` / `MAX_STORE_DRIVERS`, §24.4) and fail-closed: a missing
store, an unreadable sub-directory, or a malformed entry simply contributes
fewer paths and never aborts the boot (§18.4 / §2.9). The single record
carries the `drivers` count found and the `skipped` count refused.

The **Sink** column names the `BootInfo`-supplied channel each record
is emitted on. Audit-class boot lifecycle events
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4.4 — security-relevant decisions) route through
`audit_sink`; phase-timeline events route through the diagnostic
`log_sink`. Production kernels typically wire both sinks to the same
COM1 backend; the QEMU integration test bin
(`tests/integration/kernel_arch_boot`) intercepts the audit channel
only, observing `KERNEL_BOOT_COMPLETED` to flip the QEMU
`isa-debug-exit` device.

New events take the next free identifier and require an update to this
table and the event catalogue in `kernel/core/src/audit.rs`.

## Retained boot audit ring

The audit events above are emitted to the `audit_sink`, which a production
kernel wires to the serial console. That sink is *write-through*: once a line
is on the wire it is gone. Before `/System/Logs` is writable there is no
durable place to read boot history back from, yet the pre-boot **Supervisor**
console (`plans/NEW-SUPERVISOR.md`) needs to `log`-tail exactly those early
records when a boot goes wrong. `tairix_log::BootRing` retains records too but
is a *drain-once* FIFO — importing it empties it — so it cannot serve a viewer
that reads repeatedly.

`kernel/core::boot_audit_ring::BootAuditRing<N, I>` is the retained,
tail-able store that fills the gap. It is a `tairix_log::Sink` composed
*alongside* the serial audit sink (never instead of it), so every record the
kernel already emits is teed into a bounded ring of the most recent `N`
entries and can be read back **non-destructively** any number of times. It
re-derives nothing: it copies only what an audit line already carries — the
`Level`, the stable `EventId`, the message, and the monotonic time it reads
from an injected `MonotonicClock` (a `Sink` receives no timestamp).

* **SMP-/ISR-safe.** The ring guards its state with the shared
  `IrqSafeSpinLock` (generic over the architecture's `InterruptControl`,
  supplied by the bin crate's `static`), which masks interrupts on the
  current CPU for the short, allocation- and I/O-free duration of a record
  copy. The lock is never held across rendering: a viewer fetches one record
  per lock acquisition, so a slow console write cannot keep interrupts masked.
* **Consistent under a live writer.** Each record takes a strictly-increasing
  global sequence; a viewer discovers the retained range with `seq_range` and
  fetches each with `record(seq)`. A sequence names the same record for as
  long as it is retained, so a concurrent eviction can only make a later fetch
  return `None` (the record aged out), never a different record. `total`
  counts every record ever written, so a viewer can show "the last `k` of `N`".
* **Bounded, never allocating, never panicking.** A fixed-capacity inline
  array; a full ring overwrites the oldest (a tail keeps *recent* history). A
  message longer than `TAIL_MESSAGE_MAX` is truncated on a UTF-8 boundary, so
  a stored message is always valid UTF-8 and no input can make a read panic.

It lives in `kernel/core` rather than `lib/log` because that is where both its
producer (the audit-sink composition) and its consumer (the Supervisor host)
live, and because `lib/log` stays the pure record vocabulary rather than
gaining a retained store only the kernel uses.

## Testing

The crate is fully host-testable. `kernel/core/tests/kernel_main.rs`
drives the entry point with a `TestArch + TestSink` and asserts:

* the happy-path init order matches this document exactly,
* a failing `mem` phase logs `PhaseFailed { phase = "mem",
  cause = "mem_out_of_memory" }` and halts,
* a malformed `BootInfo` is reported under the `log` phase with the
  documented `cause` string,
* `handle_panic` emits exactly one `KERNEL_PANIC` record and halts.

The mock `TestArch::halt` panics with a sentinel message so
`std::panic::catch_unwind` can observe the halt without blocking the
test runner; this scaffold is gated behind the `test-arch` Cargo
feature and never links into a production build.

## Stage 2 integration tests

`AGENTS.md` §7 routes cross-crate / end-to-end tests to the top-level
`tests/` tree. Stage 2 enrols two:

- `tests/integration/memory_isolation/src/main.rs` — a freestanding
  x86_64 kernel binary that builds two distinct page tables, switches
  CR3 between them, and asserts that the attacker context faults
  (`#PF`, error code 0, CR2 == target VA) while the victim's frame
  remains intact. Executes under QEMU through
  `cargo xtask test --qemu`. See
  [`platform/x86_64.md`](../platform/x86_64.md).
- `tests/integration/scheduler_stress/tests/stress.rs` — a 20 000-task
  / 4-simulated-core deadlock-free, bounded-latency stress over the
  `tairix-kernel-sched-mlfq` public surface. Runs as part of the host-side
  `cargo xtask test` pass today. Promoting it to QEMU is on the
  Stage 3a sub-checklist in `PLAN.md` (depends on SMP + APIC timer +
  IPI).

`tools/qemu` is the audited gateway between the host build and any
QEMU integration test (PVH direct boot via `-kernel`,
`isa-debug-exit` device, strict per-test timeouts, no retries —
`AGENTS.md` §7). Each run's serial transcript is persisted beside its guest
binary as `<kernel>.serial.log` whatever the verdict, so a pass can be checked
against the witnesses it claims rather than taken on the exit status alone.

## Stage 3a (c7) — first production `KernelArch` impl

`kernel/arch/x86_64::kernel_arch::X86_64Arch` (Stage 3a (c7-arch),
PLAN.md) is the first production implementation of the Arch HAL trait
`tairix_arch_api::SchedulerArch` (`AGENTS.md` §17.2) in tree;
`kernel/sched/api` re-exports that trait, so the impl also satisfies
every `tairix_kernel_sched_api::SchedulerArch` bound. The trait impl is
feature-gated behind `tairix-arch-x86_64`'s opt-in `sched-arch`
feature — see
[`platform/x86_64.md`](../platform/x86_64.md#stage-3a-c7-arch--schedulerarch-impl-for-x86_64)
for the bare-metal / host semantics and the dependency rationale.

The matching `tairix_kernel_core::KernelArch::halt` impl now ships in
the Stage 3a (c7-bin) `tairix-kernel` binary at
`kernel/tairix-kernel/` — see
[`platform/x86_64.md`](../platform/x86_64.md#stage-3a-c7-bin--tairix-kernel-binary)
for the boot pipeline. The bin crate's `BinArch(X86_64Arch)` newtype
satisfies Rust's orphan rules; `BinArch::halt` forwards to the free
function `kernel_arch::halt()` and is compile-time-pinned to the
`-> !` signature by `_BIN_ARCH_HALT_RETURNS_NEVER`. The bin's
`kernel_main(boot_info)` body composes everything: boot info →
ACPI/MADT → `BootMemoryMap`; `X86_64Arch::new`; per-CPU init; the
fail-closed syscall-dispatch callback installed *before* `syscall` is
enabled on any CPU; finally `BootInfo::new` + forward to
`tairix_kernel_core::kernel_main`.

The companion QEMU integration test
`tests/integration/kernel_arch_boot` boots the binary end-to-end
under QEMU on `-smp 1` and exits successfully on observing
`AuditEvent::BootCompleted` (`EventId(4004)`).

### Stage 2.7 follow-up

The (c7-bin) dispatch callback is **fail-closed**: it parks the CPU
forever if any `syscall` ever reaches it (none does at this stage —
there is no user space yet). When Stage 2.7 lands a
`SyscallHandlers` impl and per-CPU `CallerContext` plumbing, the
callback body is replaced with a forwarder to
`tairix_kernel_syscall::Dispatcher::dispatch`. The ABI is pinned at
compile time by `_DISPATCH_SIGNATURE_PINNED`, so the swap is a
body-only change with no public-surface impact.
