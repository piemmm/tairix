# ext4 driver

`drivers/filesystem/ext4` (`tairix-drv-fs-ext4`) is a **read/write**
driver for ext2/ext3/ext4 volumes behind any
[`Block`](../abi/driver_traits.md) device. It implements the versioned
`FilesystemRead`, `FilesystemWrite`, and `FilesystemSecurity` traits; the
frozen `Filesystem` trait remains mount/unmount only, so each surface is
a separate trait rather than a widening of the shipped one
(`AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9), exactly as for the [FAT32](./fat32.md) and
[arxfs](./arxfs.md) drivers.

ext4 is the dominant Linux on-disk format, so reading existing volumes
(installation media, foreign disks) was the first need; mutation arrived
later behind the separate `FilesystemWrite` trait, and now maintains the
on-disk checksums (`metadata_csum`/`gdt_csum`) and wide 64-bit
descriptors a real `mkfs.ext4` image carries.

## On-disk support

| Feature                                  | Support                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Block sizes 1024 / 2048 / 4096           | yes                           |
| 128- or 256-byte inodes                  | yes                           |
| 32- or 64-byte group descriptors (64bit) | yes                           |
| Extent-mapped inodes (default ext4)      | yes, incl. multi-level trees  |
| Classic block map (ext2/ext3)            | yes (direct + 1/2/3 indirect) |
| Linear directory blocks                  | yes                           |
| Hash-indexed (`htree`) directories       | yes: lookup, listing, add and remove through a root and one interior level |

`Ext4::open` validates the superblock magic (`0xEF53` at byte `0x38` of
the superblock, which itself starts at the fixed byte offset 1024) and
re-derives the geometry — block size, inodes/blocks per group, inode
size, descriptor size, and the group-descriptor table offset — rejecting
a bad magic or an inconsistent geometry with `DriverError::BadMagic` and
an out-of-range block size with `DriverError::Unsupported`. The device
logical-block size and the filesystem block size are independent: all
I/O is staged one device block at a time.

## Nodes and mapping

A `NodeId` is the on-disk inode number, so there is no in-memory inode
table; each operation reads the inode on demand. Logical-to-physical
block mapping covers both on-disk layouts:

- **Extent-mapped** inodes walk the extent tree from the inline root in
  `i_block`, descending interior index nodes up to a bounded depth. An
  uninitialised extent and a missing extent both read as zeros.
- **Block-mapped** inodes resolve the 12 direct pointers and the single,
  double, and triple indirect blocks. A zero pointer is a sparse hole
  and reads as zeros.

## Symbolic links

A link's target is read with `read_link`, in both spellings ext4 uses. The
**fast** form keeps the target in the raw 60-byte `i_block` array and allocates
nothing; the **slow** form stores it as ordinary file data. `i_size` is the
target's length either way, and the discriminator is the one Linux's
`ext4_inode_is_fast_symlink` uses: a fast link allocates no data, so `i_blocks`
accounts for nothing beyond an external extended-attribute block (one
allocation cluster, which is the block size unless the volume carries
`bigalloc`). A target longer than the `i_block` array could not be inline
whatever the accounting says, so that is checked first and the accounting is
consulted only for one that would fit.

Two honest limits rather than guesses: an **inline-data** link keeps its target
in the inode's own extended-attribute area, which this driver decodes nowhere,
so it answers `Unsupported`; and this driver **reads** foreign links but does
not **author** them, so `create_link` answers `Unsupported` too — the VFS
surfaces both as `NotSupported`, the permanent limit a caller can tell from a
structural refusal. A link is never byte-readable (`read_at` refuses one) and
`create` refuses the link kind, so no path here can produce a regular file
whose contents merely look like a path.

## Directories

A child's kind comes from the directory entry's `file_type` byte when the
`filetype` feature is set, otherwise from the child inode's mode; unused
slots and the `.`/`..` self-links are skipped (the VFS resolves those
itself, §16). A directory is read one of two ways.

**Linear.** Every block is a leaf, scanned in order by record length. A
listing cursor is a record's byte offset: parsing resumes at the cursor's
block's first record and takes the first record at or past it, so a cursor
that is not a record boundary can only skip, never misparse. A record here
never moves while in use — removal folds it into its predecessor, insertion
splits a record's slack or appends a block — so an entry present throughout
a listing is listed exactly once.

**Hash-indexed** (`htree`, on a volume with `dir_index`). Block 0 is a root
mapping ranges of a name hash to leaf blocks, directly or through one level
of interior nodes. A lookup hashes the name and reads its leaf, and the
leaves after it while a run of that hash continues. A listing runs in
`(hash, name)` order and resumes just past the name it last returned —
leaves are packed and split here, so records do move, and no move disturbs
that position. Its cursor is a keyed digest of the name, never `0`.

- **Hashes.** The legacy, half-MD4 and TEA hashes, over bytes read as signed
  or unsigned as the superblock records, seeded by `s_hash_seed`. They are
  implemented from the format and the published algorithms they build on
  (MD4, RFC 1320; TEA, Wheeler and Needham, 1994) and checked against
  e2fsprogs' `debugfs dx_hash` as a black box.
- **New names** go into the leaf their hash selects. A full leaf whose free
  space is only scattered is packed first; otherwise it is split at a cut
  that keeps a hash's entries together when it can and balances the halves'
  bytes. A full root moves its entries down to a new interior level, and a
  full interior node splits; with both levels full a name is refused with
  `NoSpace`, as is one whose hash already spans 16 leaves.
- **Write order.** The new block, then the inode mapping it, then the index
  naming it, then the block it came from: stopped part-way, an entry is left
  in two leaves rather than none, and readers pass over an entry outside its
  leaf's hash range.
- **Checksums.** Under `metadata_csum` every index block's tail and every
  leaf's tail is checked before it is used and resealed when written; a
  mismatch fails closed with `DeviceFault`. A linear directory's leaves are
  checked the same way.
- **An index this driver cannot use** — a root of the wrong shape, SipHash
  (casefolded encrypted directories), a superblock recording no byte
  signedness, or a third level (`largedir`) — is read linearly, its names
  still found, listed and removed, and adding one is refused before anything
  changes (`DeviceFault` for damage, `Unsupported` otherwise).
- Without `dir_index` the index flag means nothing: the directory is linear,
  and adding a name clears the stale flag.

## Security

ext4 stores a per-inode owner, mode, and ACL, but the driver makes **no**
permission decision: the VFS metadata layer that mounts it is the policy
point (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

The driver implements the versioned `FilesystemSecurity` trait (as
[arxfs](./arxfs.md) does), so the VFS can drive authorization from the
stored per-inode §5.3 record instead of the uniform mount-point
template. `security(node)` reports a `NodeSecurity` carrying the inode's
POSIX mode (the low 12 bits, with the type bits stripped) and its owner
uid/gid; each id recombines its low half (`i_uid`/`i_gid`) with the osd2
high half (`l_i_uid_high`/`l_i_gid_high`). ext4 has no inline capability
gate, so the record carries no `required_cap`.

### POSIX ACLs

Named-user and named-group POSIX ACL grants are decoded from the inode's
`system.posix_acl_access` extended attribute into the record's inline
ACL entries. ext4 keeps that attribute in two places, both of which the
driver reads:

- an **inline** region in the tail of an enlarged (`inode_size > 128`)
  inode record, immediately after `i_extra_isize`, whose entry value
  offsets are measured from the first entry; and
- an **external block** named by `i_file_acl`, whose entry value offsets
  are measured from the start of the block.

Both share the `ext4_xattr_entry` encoding (magic `0xEA020000`,
`e_name_index = 2` for the access ACL). The `ACL_USER` / `ACL_GROUP`
entries map to one grant-only `SecurityAcl` each (`SecuritySubject::User`
/ `Group` with the POSIX `rwx` triad); the owner/owning-group/other/mask
entries are already expressed by the mode bits, so they are skipped. A
volume may carry the attribute inline, in the external block, in both, or
in neither; an absent or malformed region simply contributes no grants
(the mode bits still apply — `AGENTS.md` §5.4, fail closed). The record's
inline ACL budget bounds the number of named grants surfaced.

## Writing

The `FilesystemWrite` surface (`create`, `write_at`, `truncate`,
`remove`, `flush`) mutates a mounted volume. Like the read surface it
makes **no** permission decision — the VFS authorises every write before
delegating (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). New files and directories are created with
the classic block map (12 direct pointers + the single indirect block);
file data is allocated from the block bitmap, inodes from the inode
bitmap, and the group-descriptor and superblock free counts are kept in
step. Directory entries are added and removed as [Directories](#directories)
describes; a removal drops the name before the inode it names, so a failed
write never leaves a name pointing at a freed inode, and a create that
cannot place its name gives its inode back. A renamed entry keeps the type
its inode has. The directory and allocation paths take their block-sized
scratch from the heap rather than the small kernel stack they nest on. `truncate` frees the tail
blocks of the classic map and the extent map (the inline depth-0 root or
a depth-1 tree) and zeroes the retained partial block so a later
extension reads as zeros.

A pre-existing extent-mapped file (those a foreign `mkfs` created) grows
in place: `write_at` extends the last extent when the new block is
contiguous and otherwise appends a fresh extent. When the four inline
`i_block` extent slots are exhausted, the inline root is converted into
a **depth-1 tree** — its extents move into a freshly allocated leaf
block and the root becomes an index node — after which further leaves
are attached through new (ascending-ordered) root index entries.
`truncate`/`remove` free a depth-1 tree's emptied leaf blocks and drop
their index entries, collapsing the root back to an empty depth-0 node
when no leaf survives. A tree that would need a second index level
(depth ≥ 2) is refused (see below); the driver never builds one, and the
read path still maps any depth on disk.

### Checksums and wide descriptors

The write path maintains every on-disk checksum a volume carries, so a
default `mkfs.ext4` image (`metadata_csum`, `extent`, `64bit`) is mutated
in place. The checksum primitives are **first-party** — a storage
checksum is not a cryptographic primitive, so `AGENTS.md` §2.12's "never
roll your own" does not apply:

- **`metadata_csum`** uses crc32c (reversed polynomial `0x82F6_3B78`,
  seeded with `crc32c(~0, s_uuid)`) — `lib/crc32c`'s, its dispatched
  hardware instruction continuing each seed as a raw register — for the
  superblock `s_checksum`, each group descriptor `bg_checksum`, the
  block/inode-bitmap checksums, every inode (`i_checksum_lo`/`hi`, seeded
  per inode by number and generation), each directory leaf's
  `ext4_dir_entry_tail`, each index block's `dx_tail`, and each allocated
  extent block's `ext4_extent_tail`.
- **`gdt_csum`/`uninit_bg`** uses crc16 (reversed polynomial `0xA001`)
  for the legacy group-descriptor checksum.
- **`64bit`** descriptors carry the high halves of the bitmap checksums
  and `bg_itable_unused`, which the allocator also maintains.

Mutation still **fails closed** (`DriverError::Unsupported`) on a feature
the write path cannot maintain — anything outside the supported
`incompat`/`ro_compat` allow-list, e.g. `bigalloc`, `meta_bg`,
`inline_data`, or an explicit `checksum_seed` (which would invalidate the
uuid-derived seed) — and on an uninitialised block group
(`BLOCK_UNINIT`/`INODE_UNINIT`). `remove`/`truncate` of a file whose
mapping is neither the classic map nor a depth-0/depth-1 extent tree,
and growing an extent tree beyond a single index level (depth ≥ 2), are
refused rather than orphaning blocks or half-building a tree. Such
volumes stay fully **readable**. This is a deliberate, documented
boundary (`AGENTS.md` §2.1 / §5.4), not a silent best-effort.

## Formatting (mkfs)

`Ext4::format(block, inode_count)` lays a fresh, empty volume onto a
blank `Block` device and returns it mounted — the write-side counterpart
of `open()`, with no `mkfs` shell-out (`AGENTS.md` §12/§2.12). After
`format()` the bytes are handed straight to `open()`, which remains the
single source of truth for the on-disk layout.

The formatter writes a deliberately conservative shape the read/write
path fully supports: `filetype` + `extent` only (no `metadata_csum`,
`gdt_csum`, or `64bit`, so no checksum maintenance is needed), 128-byte
inodes, 32-byte group descriptors, block size 4096 bytes for volumes
≥ 128 MiB and 1024 bytes otherwise, and `blocks_per_group = 8 *
block_size`. Only whole groups are laid down — so the reader's group
count is exact — and **every** group is fully materialised (no
lazy/`UNINIT` groups), so the volume can be filled to exhaustion. The
reserved inodes 1..=10 and an extent-mapped empty root directory
(inode 2) are written; `inode_count` is the minimum total inode budget,
rounded up to a whole number of inodes per group (≥ 16 per group).

Allocation past the free data blocks or the inode budget fails with
`DriverError::NoSpace` (POSIX `ENOSPC`), distinct from `DeviceFault`
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §2.9); a device too small for one group plus a data
region, or a zero `inode_count`, is refused with `OutOfRange`. Files
created on a formatted volume use the classic block map, so a single
file reaches at most 12 direct + one single-indirect block.

## Capabilities

Loading requires `CAP_DRV_LOAD`; the `FilesystemRead` methods are reached
only through the `DriverHandle` the host minted at load time. The driver
runs in user space and does not request `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`.

## Tests

`cargo test -p tairix-drv-fs-ext4` builds an in-memory ext4 image (block
size 1024, one block group, 128-byte inodes, `filetype` on, with block
and inode bitmaps and free space) holding an extent-mapped root, an
extent-mapped file, a subdirectory with a nested file, and a classic
block-mapped file that combines direct pointers, sparse holes, and a
single-indirect block. The 44 host-side tests cover superblock
validation, `node_info`, ordered listing with `.`/`..` suppression and
end-of-directory, `lookup` and subdirectory traversal, extent and
classic reads (including across holes and the direct/indirect boundary),
the `Unsupported`/`BufferTooSmall`/`NotFound` guards, the `register`
capability gate, the `FilesystemSecurity::security` record for a file
and a directory, and the write surface: create + multi-block write
round-trips (persisting across a remount), duplicate / invalid-name /
non-directory rejection, sparse extension, `truncate` shrink-then-grow,
directory creation with `.`/`..` and removal (empty vs.
`DirectoryNotEmpty`), inode
reuse after `remove`, the `write_at`/`truncate` directory and
not-found guards, free-inode exhaustion, the fail-closed refusal of
mutation on an unsupported (`checksum_seed`) feature set, the depth-0 →
depth-1 extent-tree growth (sparse writes that overflow the inline root,
with read-back and remount persistence, a sparse hole between extents,
and depth-1 `truncate`-to-zero and `remove` freeing and reusing the
tree's blocks), and the POSIX-ACL decode —
standalone `decode`/`find` units (both value-base conventions, bad
version, the inline budget cap, unrelated attributes) plus end-to-end
`security` reads of an external xattr block, a garbage block, and an
inline ACL in a 256-byte-inode volume.

A separate integration suite (`tests/checksummed.rs`) validates the
checksum maintenance against **real `mke2fs 1.47.0`** images committed
under `tests/fixtures/` — one `metadata_csum,extent,64bit` volume and one
legacy `gdt_csum` volume. It recomputes every on-disk checksum with an
*independent* crc implementation, both on the pristine fixture (proving
the reference crc matches `mke2fs`) and after a
`create`/`write`/`truncate`/`mkdir`/`remove` cycle (proving the driver
wrote correct checksums); the mutated images also pass `e2fsck -f`
cleanly. A `pjdfstest`-equivalent POSIX suite and an end-to-end QEMU
vertical remain future work.

## Extended-metadata representability

The ext4 driver does **not** implement the `FilesystemAttrs` ABI (its
attribute facet answers `None`, so the `fs_attr_*` syscalls refuse an ext4
mount with `NotSupported`), so it cannot
represent ARXFS extended attributes or foreign-filesystem preset metadata
(`arxfs-spec.md` §21). Under the cross-filesystem preservation contract an
exact-preservation copy of a file carrying such attributes onto ext4 reports
`MetadataNotRepresentable`; a best-effort copy drops them only under an
explicit, documented lossy policy. (ext4 xattr blocks are read today only to
recover POSIX ACLs, not as a general key/value store.)
