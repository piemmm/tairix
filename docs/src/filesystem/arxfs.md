# arxfs driver

`arxfs` (`drivers/filesystem/arxfs`, crate `tairix-drv-fs-arxfs`) is the
**native TAIRiX filesystem**: a block-backed, copy-on-write filesystem that
stores full POSIX metadata plus an inline access-control list and an
optional capability gate **per inode** (`AGENTS.md` §5.3). There is exactly
one on-disk version — `arxfs` is built up internally in the stages of
its [specification](./arxfs-spec.md), but the driver and its format are a
single shipping thing, not a `v1`/`v2` pair. It
sits behind any `tairix_abi::driver::block::Block` device and is exposed
through the versioned `FilesystemRead` and `FilesystemWrite` traits — never
by widening the frozen mount/unmount `Filesystem` trait (`AGENTS.md` §2.4 /
§9).

The driver **stores** each inode's owner, mode, ACL, and capability gate
but makes **no** permission decision itself: the VFS is the policy point
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4). The stored record is read back through the versioned
`FilesystemSecurity` trait (`security(node) -> NodeSecurity`) and written
through `ARXFS::set_security`. Because `arxfs` implements
`FilesystemSecurity`, the kernel host delegates to it through the VFS's
`*_via_secured` operations, which judge each node against its **own**
stored §5.3 record (`Metadata::from_node_security`) rather than a uniform
mount-point template — so an owner-only or capability-gated file is
enforced as stored. See [Driver delegation](./overview.md) and the
[driver-trait reference](../abi/driver_traits.md).

## On-disk layout

A volume is a sequence of fixed-size blocks (the device's logical block
size, between 512 and 4096 bytes, a power of two). The device opens at a
**superblock ring** of four logical slots, each a **mirrored pair** of
adjacent blocks (eight blocks in all); everything else is allocated
copy-on-write from the pool that follows. `ARXFS::open` re-derives and
validates the geometry from the selected superblock slot.

| Region          | Contents                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Superblock ring | Blocks 0–7: four slots, each a mirrored pair of blocks,   |
|                 | each pointing at a committed root.                        |
| Pool            | Everything else, allocated copy-on-write: the transaction |
|                 | root, the inode-tree nodes, the per-file extent-tree      |
|                 | nodes, the pending-delete set, directory blocks, and raw  |
|                 | file-data blocks.                                        |

The superblock also carries an **incompatible-feature word**: a plaintext
bitmap of on-disk structures a reader must implement to mount at all, covered
by the block's keyed authenticator. A volume declaring a bit this build does
not know is refused with `DriverError::Unsupported` — refused with its reason
rather than mounted and misread. Two bits are defined, `symlinks` and
`hardlinks`, and a volume gains each from its first use of the structure it
names rather than at format time, so a volume that has never held a link stays
readable by a build without the feature.

Every **metadata** block is self-identifying (`AGENTS.md` §8 block
identity): its first 128 bytes carry a magic, block type, format version,
the volume UUID, an owner object, a generation, its logical and physical
address, and a **keyed authenticator** — an HMAC-SHA256 tag computed
through `lib/crypto` (`AGENTS.md` §2.12) over identity + payload. Decoding
verifies all of that against the address the reader *expected*, so a stale,
misdirected, wrong-type, torn, bit-rotted, or wrong-key block is rejected at
decode time and the mount fails closed (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). Raw file-data
blocks carry no header; their tail holds a 28-byte per-block crypto trailer
(a 12-byte nonce and a 16-byte AEAD tag, see [Encryption](#encryption)), a
5-byte compression descriptor (see [Compression](#compression)), and a 36-byte
**data-integrity trailer** (a 32-byte logical content hash and a 4-byte
physical checksum, see [Data integrity](#data-integrity)), so a data block
holds `block_size - 69` bytes of file content — 443 on a 512-byte device, 4027
on a 4096-byte one.

Inodes are 256-byte records held in a **copy-on-write inode tree** keyed by
inode number (see the next section); inode 1 is the root directory. Each
inode names the root of its own **extent tree**, which maps a file's logical
block offset to a physical run `(start, length)` — so a file can span the
whole volume and a large contiguous write collapses to a single extent
record. Directories are block-addressed payloads of fixed-width **263-byte
slots** (an 8-byte header — a 4-byte `inode` number and 4-byte `name_len` —
plus a maximum-length 255-byte name) reached through the same extent map; the
entry names are encrypted at rest and the block reserves the same 28-byte
crypto trailer at its tail (see [Encryption](#encryption)). Names follow
ext4's rules — 1..=255 bytes, with `/` and NUL the only forbidden bytes —
and are compared byte-for-byte, so they are **case-sensitive**; a directory
grows by whole copy-on-write blocks as entries are added (one slot per
512-byte block, fourteen per 4096-byte block). `.` and `..` are stored on disk
and hidden from `read_dir`. The inode record also stores the four §21
timestamps and, for a file or link, its **content generation** — the version
of its data, drawn from one volume-wide sequence the transaction root carries
and never handed out twice, not even across a crash (`arxfs-spec.md` §13,
§14). A volume written by a different format version is refused rather than
misread.

The volume's committed block count is pinned in the superblock and may be
smaller than the backing device; `ARXFS::grow` extends a mounted volume to
fill an enlarged device online and in place, folding the new free tail blocks
into the pool and committing the larger size in one atomic transaction (online
shrink is not offered). See [`arxfs-spec.md` §13](./arxfs-spec.md).

## Metadata authentication and redundancy (`arxfs-spec.md` §5, §8)

Each metadata block is sealed with a **keyed authenticator** (HMAC-SHA256
through `lib/crypto`, `AGENTS.md` §2.12 — crypto is the standing "don't roll
your own" exception) covering the block's identity *and* its payload, so the
tag detects not only a flipped payload byte but a stale, misdirected,
wrong-type, torn, or wrong-key block. The metadata-authentication key is the
volume's, derived from the per-volume master key (see
[Encryption](#encryption)); a volume opened with the wrong key never recovers
it and the mount is refused, fail-closed.

Every metadata block is stored in **two physical copies** — a primary and a
companion mirror at the adjacent block (`companion = primary + 1`), so
metadata is allocated in adjacent pairs. One read path serves all metadata
— superblock-ring slots, transaction roots, B-tree nodes, and directory
blocks: it reads the primary, and when the primary fails to authenticate it
falls back to the companion and **repairs** the primary from the good copy
(`arxfs-spec.md` §8 — try redundant copies, repair bad from good). If both
copies fail to authenticate the read fails closed; it never trusts corrupt
bytes and never panics (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §2.9). A directory's content
blocks are themselves metadata, so they too are mirrored pairs; a regular
file's data blocks are single-copy and carry no header. Because every
metadata block obeys the one `primary + 1` rule, there is a single
redundancy mechanism rather than one per structure (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

## Encryption

ARXFS is **encrypted by default and has no plaintext mode**
(`arxfs-spec.md` §5, §7): there is no code path that lays out an unencrypted
volume. Every volume is created with a caller-supplied **volume key** (the
installer's, recovery flow's, or storage policy service's key material):
`ARXFS::format(block, inode_hint, &volume_key, &mut entropy)` provisions the
per-volume key hierarchy and `ARXFS::open(block, &volume_key)` recovers it.
The `entropy` argument is the `EntropySource` seam onto the platform RNG
(`lib/rng`'s `CsRng`, `AGENTS.md` §1/§4); `ARXFS` never reaches for a global
RNG itself, the concrete generator is injected at the composition root.

The key hierarchy is grown through `lib/crypto` only (`AGENTS.md` §2.12 —
crypto is the standing "don't roll your own" exception):

```text
volume key (caller-supplied)
  -> wrapping key  (KDF)  ── unwraps ──> master key (on disk, AEAD-wrapped)
                                            -> metadata-authentication key (HMAC-SHA256)
                                            -> filename key (AEAD)
                                            -> content  key (AEAD)
```

The master key is **never stored unwrapped**: only its AEAD-sealed form lives
on disk, in the plaintext discovery region of every superblock-ring slot (the
minimal unlock header the spec permits). `open` derives the wrapping key from
the supplied volume key, unseals the master key, and derives the working
keys. A **wrong key** never authenticates the wrapped blob, so the mount is
refused with `PermissionDenied`, fail-closed (`AGENTS.md` §5.4), never a panic
(§2.9).

- **File data** is encrypted per block under the content key with
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 (`lib/crypto/src/aead.rs`); the block's 28-byte trailer
  holds the nonce and tag, so a bit-flip in encrypted data is **detected** by
  the authenticator on read rather than silently mis-decrypted.
- **Directory-entry names** are encrypted under the filename key the same
  way; the directory block is then sealed with the metadata authenticator
  (encrypt-then-MAC), and the read path authenticates then decrypts.
- **Metadata** (superblock, transaction roots, B-tree nodes) stays
  authenticated-only — its confidentiality is not in this stage's scope,
  though a directory block's *names* are encrypted.

The KDF is HMAC-SHA256 used as a single-block HKDF-Expand
(`lib/crypto/src/kdf.rs`), and the AEAD nonce for a data or directory block
is derived from its `(physical address, generation)` and stored in the
trailer, so copy-on-write never reuses a `(key, nonce)` pair. The master key,
the wrapping salt, and the wrap nonce are drawn at format time from the
injected platform RNG, so the master key is **independent of the volume key**
(and re-wrappable on a future key change) rather than derived from it; only
the wrapping key stays a deterministic KDF of the volume key and the random
salt so `open` can recompute it. The per-volume UUID is likewise a random
draw. A failed entropy draw fails closed — no volume is laid out with
predictable key material (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

## Data integrity

Every file-data block carries a two-layer **data-integrity field**
(`arxfs-spec.md` §6, §8), stored in a 36-byte trailer that follows the crypto
trailer and the compression descriptor (`src/integrity.rs`). It complements — and is distinct from — the
Stage-4 AEAD tag: the AEAD proves *authenticity* of the ciphertext, while this
field gives a cheap media-corruption check plus a content-addressable name for
the plaintext.

- **Logical content hash** (32 bytes). The hash of the block's decrypted
  content slot, taken before encryption on write and recomputed after
  decryption on read: the plaintext for a raw record — identical content
  hashes identically, the seam Stage 7 deduplication keys on (`arxfs-spec.md`
  §9) — or the block's slice of the compressed frame for a cluster block,
  whose end-to-end plaintext integrity then rests on the AEAD plus the
  exact-size decompression of the authenticated frame.
- **Physical checksum** (8 bytes). A fast, non-cryptographic checksum over the
  block's at-rest bytes (ciphertext + crypto trailer + stored-form descriptor +
  logical hash). It is verified **first** on read, so media or transport bit
  rot is caught cheaply before the AEAD runs.

The write path is the spec's: take the logical hash of the content slot,
encrypt it (a whole-cluster write compresses first — see *Compression*
below), then checksum the at-rest block. The read path reverses it: verify
the physical checksum, decrypt-and-authenticate, verify the logical hash,
and decompress a compressed cluster's assembled frame.
Each layer fails closed to a `DriverError` (never a panic, `AGENTS.md` §5.4 /
§2.9) and is kept internally distinct (`integrity::DataFault` —
`Physical`/`Aead`/`Logical`) so a media fault is not confused with a tamper or
a plaintext mismatch, the seam Stage 8 scrub and Stage 11 health will record
against.

The logical hash is computed through `lib/crypto`'s audited SHA-256
(`AGENTS.md` §2.12 — never hand-rolled). The specification's fixed-v1 constant
names BLAKE3-256; `lib/crypto` exposes only the audited RustCrypto SHA-256, and
importing a `blake3` crate would widen the trusted computing base with a SIMD
backend that does not build cleanly on the bare-metal kernel targets (the same
freestanding-SIMD problem already pinned around for `chacha20` and
`curve25519-dalek`). SHA-256 is a 256-bit collision-resistant hash that fills
the integrity-and-dedupe role identically, so ARXFS v1 uses it; `AGENTS.md`
§2.12 (use the audited `lib/crypto` hash, do not hand-roll or import an unvetted
one) takes precedence over the spec's named primitive. The physical checksum is
a first-party FNV-1a — a checksum is not a cryptographic primitive, so §2.12
does not bar rolling it, and the block's keyed authenticity still rests on the
AEAD and the metadata MAC.

## Serving reads: one device request per contiguous run

An extent maps a **contiguous** physical run, so a read spanning one asks the
device **once for the whole run** rather than once per block
(`read_block_run`, `RunStage`). The run window is 64 KiB — the transfer a
storage controller moves on a single DMA descriptor — so a read parks the
calling task across round-trips proportional to the runs it spans, not to the
blocks inside them. Reading a 1 MiB file (261 content blocks) costs **35**
device requests, against **783** when the same bytes are fetched a block at a
time; a whole-file read also descends the extent tree once per run instead of
once per block.

The fetch is separate from the checks, never instead of them: every block in a
staged run still passes its own physical checksum, its own AEAD, and its own
content-slot hash keyed by its own physical address (`verify_data_block`), so a
misdirected, stale, or bit-rotted block *inside* a run fails the read closed
exactly as a single-block read would. The staging is one allocation per read,
bounded by the window, wiped on drop (it holds decrypted user content), and
falls back to a single block when memory is too tight to reserve it — a
machine under pressure reads slower rather than failing (`AGENTS.md` §4,
§26.3). A compressed cluster's stored blocks are contiguous too, so its frame
is fetched in one request as well.

## Compression

Compression is **mandatory and always on** (`arxfs-spec.md` §1, §10) and
operates at **cluster granularity** (`src/cluster.rs`, on-disk format
version 2): a write covering a whole aligned **cluster** — 16 logical blocks —
compresses its plaintext as one frame and, when that frees at least one
block, stores it in `ceil(frame / capacity) < 16` contiguous physical blocks
recorded as a single **compressed extent**. The freed blocks are genuinely
returned to the pool — `allocated` (the `st_blocks` analogue) reports the
stored size. The codec is **first-party** — the `lib/compress` crate, a
`no_std`, allocation-free LZ77 ("zstd-fast-style") codec — and ARXFS takes
**no external zstd/compression dependency** (`AGENTS.md` §2.12 / §16.4;
`arxfs-spec.md` §3). It is a low-CPU profile (a greedy hash-table match
finder, LZ4-style literal/match tokens, no entropy stage), not a
maximum-ratio one.

A **single-block record is always stored raw**: inside a fixed 1:1 block a
compressed frame frees nothing (its padding is encrypted, so not even a lower
storage layer could reclaim it), so compressing it would burn CPU on the hot
data path for zero benefit. Zero detection outranks compression — an all-zero
cluster becomes metadata-only holes; an incompressible, unaligned, or
sub-cluster write falls back to the per-block path (incompressible data is
never inflated, the §10 adaptive choice); and a fragmented volume with no
contiguous run degrades to raw storage, never to an error. Small files and
small streaming appends therefore store raw in v1; bulk writes (`cp`,
installs, large buffers) get the savings, and §10's optional background
recompression is the staged answer if profiling justifies more.

Compression never changes addressing: offsets still divide into logical
blocks, a compressed extent covers exactly one whole cluster, and reading any
byte decompresses at most one bounded cluster — seeks stay one extent-tree
descent regardless of file size. A partial overwrite or mid-cluster truncate
first **decomposes** the cluster back into ordinary per-block records
(bounded work, fully copy-on-write), then proceeds; a whole-cluster overwrite
replaces the stored run outright.

How a block stores its record is its per-block **stored-form descriptor**
(the §8 data-record *compression state* field, `src/integrity.rs`): one state
byte plus a `u32` — a raw single-block record, the **head** of a compressed
cluster (carrying the whole frame length), or a numbered **continuation** of
one, so a misdirected or reordered stored block fails closed on read. It sits
between the crypto trailer and the logical hash, so the fast physical
checksum covers it and a corrupted descriptor is caught before the AEAD runs.
`data_capacity()` reserves it alongside the crypto and integrity trailers.
Every stored block of a cluster is sealed exactly like a raw record (AEAD,
descriptor, slot hash, physical checksum), so `compress → encrypt` holds and
the crypto and integrity layers are identical for every data block.
Decompression is panic-free: a malformed or truncated frame, a wrong stored
form, or a wrong decompressed size returns an error (surfaced as the
fail-closed `DriverError::DeviceFault`), never a panic (`arxfs-spec.md`
§10, `AGENTS.md` §2.9).

On the §6 write path the order stays `dedupe → compress → encrypt` (see
*Deduplication* below): per-block dedupe runs on the per-block path, cluster
blocks never enter the dedupe index, and a missed cross-form duplicate is an
allowed missed opportunity (§9 — merging is never risked).

## Deduplication

Deduplication is **mandatory and exact** (`arxfs-spec.md` §1, §9). A physical
data record — a **chunk** — may be **shared** by more than one `(file, logical
block)`, and it keys on the Stage-5 **logical hash** (the SHA-256 of the
plaintext). Sharing is **exact and verified**: a candidate is taken only after
its stored bytes are confirmed **byte-identical** to the incoming record, so a
missed duplicate is acceptable but unequal data is never merged (§9 — merging
unequal data is corruption).

Two copy-on-write trees back it, both the **same** generic `src/btree.rs`
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2 — no second B-tree), and both named by the transaction root
alongside the inode-tree root:

- **Chunk/refcount tree.** Keyed by a chunk's physical block; the value is the
  referrer count, the encryption domain, the plaintext logical hash, and the
  logical length. It is authoritative for safe freeing.
- **Reverse-reference tree.** Keyed by the same physical block; the value is the
  capped list of `(inode, logical block)` referrers, needed by scrub / check /
  health and by safe discard.

To keep ordinary writes cheap, an **unshared** block carries an *implicit*
reference count of one and has **no** record in either tree. The first time a
block is shared it is promoted to an explicit chunk (refcount 2, both referrers
recorded); further shares bump the count and append a referrer; dropping a
reference decrements it, and dropping the last reference frees the physical
block. A chunk that falls back to a single referrer returns to the implicit
state (its records are removed) and keeps its block. Shared chunks are
**immutable**: overwriting one sharer copies-on-write a fresh record for the
writer and drops the old refcount, leaving every other sharer's data intact.

Discovery uses an in-memory **dedupe index** — `(domain, length, logical hash)
→ candidate` — that **warms from the writes that use it and is never
authoritative** (§9): it is deliberately not pre-seeded at mount, since
walking the chunk tree would cost a read per chunk with no bound on volume
size. Before sharing, a candidate is **liveness-checked** (its recorded
referrer's extent map must still point at it) and then **byte-verified**; a
candidate that fails either check is a stale index entry and is dropped,
never shared. This is what lets the fast in-memory index be approximate
without ever risking a wrong merge — a duplicate written in an earlier mount
session simply goes unfound until the cache warms again, which is a missed
opportunity, not a correctness risk.

A **reflink** (`ARXFS::reflink`) is a copy-on-write clone of a file that
shares every data block with its source until a side is written, when only the
written blocks diverge. A compressed cluster is shared **whole** — one
reference on its stored run, keyed by the extent's first physical block — and
a write inside a shared cluster decomposes a private copy for the writer,
leaving the other sharer's compressed extent intact. It is an inherent driver
operation, not a widening of a frozen `Filesystem*` ABI trait (`AGENTS.md`
§2.4).

Dedupe is **scoped to the encryption domain** (`arxfs-spec.md` §7): the domain
(derived from the volume's master key) is carried in every chunk record and in
the index key, so dedupe can never cross a domain. With a single volume key
today there is exactly one domain, but the keying already enforces the rule for
when multiple domains arrive.

## Sparse files (`arxfs-spec.md` §19)

Sparse-file support is **always on and not tunable**: a logical all-zero range
costs metadata only, never a physical data record, a zstd payload, a dedupe
chunk, or an encrypted data blob. A 10 MiB all-zero file reports a 10 MiB
logical size while allocating **zero** data blocks.

A **hole** is an unmapped logical range. ARXFS represents holes *implicitly*
as the gaps between a file's extent-tree mappings (the form `plans/SPARSE.md`
§2/§3 permit alongside an explicit ZERO extent), so a hole adds no on-disk
field and is simply the absence of an extent — there is nothing extra to
checksum, encrypt, compress, dedupe, scrub, or trim.

The write path detects zeros **first**: `store_block` runs a cheap bounded
all-zero scan (`is_all_zero`) on the full logical record before the logical
hash, dedupe lookup, compression, encryption, or physical allocation. An
all-zero record drops the block's mapping (making it a hole) and releases any
prior physical block through the normal COW/refcount/free path — a block still
held by a reflink, a deduped owner, or a retained recovery root stays live. A
zero range is never entered in the dedupe index and never compressed; repeated
*non-zero* data (e.g. `0xFF`) is not special-cased and follows the normal
storage path (a compressed cluster where a whole aligned cluster is written,
raw per-block otherwise). There is no RLE/FILL mode.

Reads of a hole synthesise zero bytes with no disk I/O. Extending a file (a
larger `truncate`, or a write past EOF) leaves the new range a hole; shrinking
frees the data extents beyond the new EOF and removed holes need no free. Scrub,
check, and rescue iterate only the mapped extent runs, so a hole is never read
and needs no data-block recovery. Because every volume is encrypted, a hole also
leaves no plaintext data payload for the zero range.

## Symbolic links (`arxfs-spec.md` §20)

A link is an inode of on-disk kind `3` (beside `1` for a directory and `2` for
a regular file) whose **stored target is its node data**: it goes through the
ordinary file write path, so the target is checksummed, authenticated,
encrypted, and dedupe-eligible exactly like file content, with no second
storage path to maintain. The driver's `kind` is an enum rather than a
directory/not-directory boolean, so every site that once treated "not a
directory" as "a regular file" has to say what it means for a link.

Three consequences worth stating rather than inheriting:

- **The compressor is never reached.** A target is at most `FS_SYMLINK_MAX`
  (4096) bytes, under one 16-block compression cluster at every supported block
  size, and a single-block record is always stored raw. Resolution reads a link
  per hop and that path stays codec-free by construction.
- **Dedupe applies.** Two links with the same target share a chunk, byte-
  verified before sharing and copied on write, as two identical files do.
  Excluding one object kind would be a `dedupe=off` knob, which the mandatory
  profile forbids — and many shortcuts to one bundle is what sharing is for.
- **A link's blocks are data.** Only a directory's content blocks are mirrored
  metadata pairs, so allocation accounting, freeing, scrub, and the free-space
  rebuild all treat a link's target blocks as the single-copy data records they
  are.

`read_at`, `write_at`, `truncate`, and `reflink` refuse a link fail-closed — a
reflink most sharply, since it clones data blocks into a fresh *regular file*
and would silently turn a link into a file holding the target's text. `create`
refuses the kind (it carries no target to store); `create_link` is the only way
to make one and `read_link` the only way to read one, returning the target
verbatim and refusing an undersized buffer rather than truncating a path.
`rescue` counts and skips links rather than emitting a target through a
byte-oriented sink.

## Online scrub (`arxfs-spec.md` §12)

`ARXFS::scrub` is an **online** verify-and-repair pass: it walks the live
volume while it stays mounted, leaning on the redundancy and integrity seams
the earlier stages already built rather than rebuilding structure offline
(that is the later `check`). It is an inherent driver operation, not a
widening of a frozen `Filesystem*` ABI trait (`AGENTS.md` §2.4), and is
**capability-gated** on `CAP_FS_MOUNT` — without it scrub fails closed with
`PermissionDenied` and logs the refusal (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

What scrub verifies, and what it repairs versus records:

- **Metadata (verify + repair).** Every live metadata block — the committed
  superblock slot, the transaction root, the inode and per-file extent
  B-trees, and the chunk and reverse-reference trees — is authenticated in
  **both** physical copies. A copy that fails the keyed authenticator is
  **repaired from its good companion** (the same redundancy seam `open` uses),
  and the repair is counted. There is exactly one copy-repair site
  (`ARXFS::repair_meta_copy`, `AGENTS.md` §2.2), so a read-only handle's
  refusal to write is stated once rather than remembered at each site; a mirror
  it declines to rewrite is counted as **damaged** instead (see below). A block
  whose **both** copies fail is recorded as an unrepairable finding —
  fail-closed, never a panic (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §2.9).
- **Data (verify + record).** Every live file-data block is run through the
  integrity read pipeline and any failure is classified by its layer —
  `Physical` (fast checksum), `Aead` (tag), or `Logical` (content hash) — and
  **recorded**. A compressed cluster is verified end-to-end in one bounded
  pass: every stored block's integrity layers plus the frame shape and its
  decompression. Deep repair / reconstruction of data is a later stage; scrub
  records honestly rather than pretending to fix what it cannot.
- **Refcounts + reverse references (verify + repair).** The chunk refcounts and
  reverse-reference sets are **recomputed from the live inode/extent trees**
  and compared with the on-disk chunk and reverse-reference trees
  (`arxfs-spec.md` §9). A divergence is a finding; scrub corrects it toward the
  extent-derived truth without dropping a referrer (a wrong refcount is reset, a
  bogus referrer struck out, a stale shared record removed, a claim the record
  never named added back). A genuinely shared block missing its chunk record is
  recorded but not fabricated (recreating one needs the chunk's logical length
  and hash, which only the data carries).

  **Bounded, not accumulated.** The recompute holds nothing proportional to the
  volume. The write path keeps the referrer list complete — sharing past the cap
  declines to dedupe (§9) — so verifying each stored referrer against the extent
  it claims to come from is one bounded lookup per referrer. The one
  irreducibly global question, whether a block with no chunk record is claimed
  by exactly one extent, is answered by streaming every claim through a
  **transient on-disk claim array** (`arxfs-spec.md` §12) at four bits per
  block: exact over every lawful refcount, so "the refcount says two but three
  extents claim it" — the divergence that frees live data — is detected rather
  than suspected. Where the volume can spare no run for the array (a read-only
  handle, a nearly-full or fragmented volume) the bounded half still runs and
  `ScrubReport::claims_counted` reports that claims were not counted; no
  correction is made from a partial truth.

**Resumable + interrupt-safe.** Scrub takes a `ScrubBudget`:
`ScrubBudget::Unlimited` verifies the whole volume in one call, while
`ScrubBudget::Inodes(n)` verifies a bounded number of inodes, then persists a
**scrub-progress record** — a `BlockType::ScrubProgress` block reached from the
transaction root, holding the resume cursor and the accumulated counts — and
returns so the caller can resume later. The accumulated `ScrubReport` of a
completed scrub is identical whether it ran in one call or many. The progress
record is **rebuildable** metadata (`arxfs-spec.md` §4): a crash mid-scrub
leaves a fully mountable volume and ordinary crash recovery never needs scrub
(§14); a corrupt progress record simply restarts the scrub rather than failing
the mount. The cursor is cleared when the pass completes.

`ScrubReport::pass` says which of the three it was — `PassVerdict::Complete`,
`Paused` (the cursor was persisted, so a later call continues this pass), or
`Stopped` (nothing was persisted, so the next call starts afresh). Only a
read-only handle produces the last, and the distinction earns its own audit
event: repeating a `Stopped` pass never reaches past its own budget, so a
caller that could not tell it from `Paused` could not tell a volume being
progressively verified from one being re-verified from the start forever.

**A read-only handle verifies and reports; it writes nothing at all**
(`arxfs-spec.md` §12) — no copy-repair, no refcount correction, no cursor, no
cleared progress record, no transaction. That is the state a volume is held in
when its medium must not be touched, so a well-meant repair there is itself the
damage. Nothing is lost from the report: a mirror the pass may not rewrite is
counted as `ScrubReport::metadata_damaged` — the good copy served the read and
the mirror is still degraded — never as a repair that did not happen, and it
classifies the volume exactly as a repaired copy would, because a copy that
went bad is the same medium signal either way.

**Report, never silent mutation.** Scrub returns a structured `ScrubReport`
(blocks checked, faults per class, repairs made, mirrors left damaged,
divergences corrected, unrepairable findings) and logs its closing outcome
through `lib/log` with a stable event ID in the `arxfs` `12000` range
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §19.4). A clean scrub of a clean volume changes nothing on
disk and is idempotent — metadata copy-repairs are direct block writes, and a
transaction is committed only when scrub actually corrected something or
persisted a cursor.

## Offline check and rescue (`arxfs-spec.md` §12)

Scrub is the *online* verifier; `check` and `rescue` are the *offline*
recovery operations it deliberately does not attempt. Both reuse the seams the
earlier stages built rather than re-implementing them (`AGENTS.md` §2.2): the
§8 block identity + companion mirror, the `DataFault` classes, the
chunk/reverse-reference trees, and the allocation-map / dedupe-index rebuilds.

**`ARXFS::check` — offline structural validation, repair, and index
rebuild.** `check` runs on a **mounted handle** (a volume that opens is the
input) and is the **superset** of the online scrub's checks plus structural
rebuild. It is **capability-gated** on `CAP_FS_MOUNT` (fail-closed and logged
otherwise) and:

- **rebuilds the rebuildable derived state first** — the on-disk allocation map
  (§4) and the in-memory dedupe index (§9) — from the authoritative trees, so a
  corrupt derivation can **never** keep a sound volume unmountable. This shares
  the one `rebuild_free_space` walk mount uses whenever it cannot adopt the
  map;
- **verifies and repairs** metadata copies, classifies data-integrity faults,
  and reconciles refcounts / reverse references against the live extents, by
  reusing the online scrub's verification core (`verify_everything`);
- **validates the directory tree** by walking it from the root: an entry
  pointing at a missing inode is a *dangling* finding (reported, not
  auto-deleted — removing a live name is not a safe automatic repair);
- **detects and reclaims orphaned inodes** — live inodes the directory tree no
  longer reaches — freeing their data blocks (releasing any shared-chunk
  references) and their inode slot; and
- **reconciles every inode's stored name count** against the directory entries
  that really name it.

The last three each derive one value per inode — reachable or not, still owed
an expansion, how many names — so each lives in a **transient on-disk scratch
array** over the inode space rather than in RAM (`arxfs-spec.md` §12). Each
directory enters the expansion frontier exactly once, which is what bounds the
queue and makes a directory cycle terminate instead of looping. Where no run
can be placed, `CheckReport::structure` reports `NotWalked` rather than a
soundness nothing established.

`check` returns a structured `CheckReport` (the embedded scrub `verification`,
directories checked, dangling entries, orphans found/reclaimed, name counts
corrected, whether the derived state was rebuilt, whether the structure was
walked and found sound, and the count of findings it could **not** safely
repair). An inode above the high-water mark the committed root records is
refused outright rather than repaired: the reachability array has no bit for
it, so a directory there would have its own children reclaimed as orphans, and
the root and the inode tree disagreeing is a driver defect rather than a volume
to fix and logs its outcome with a stable `arxfs` `12000`-range event ID. A
clean check leaves every committed structure byte-identical and is idempotent;
it commits only when it actually corrected or reclaimed something.

**`ARXFS::rescue` — damaged-volume root discovery and file extraction.**
`rescue` does **not** require a mountable filesystem. It is an associated
function (it takes the block device, not a mounted handle), capability-gated on
`CAP_FS_MOUNT`, and **read-only** on the damaged volume — the repair-on-read
paths are suppressed for its duration, so it never writes to the device. It:

1. recovers the volume keys from a surviving superblock **discovery header**
   (the wrapped master key, plaintext at rest), so a wounded superblock ring
   does not stop key recovery;
2. **scans** every physical block for a self-identifying §8 transaction root
   whose inline commit record validates (`TxnRoot::decode_any`, which needs no
   externally-supplied generation), and picks the **highest-generation** valid
   root — so it recovers a usable root even when the ring no longer names one;
3. **maps** the inode/extent metadata that root names to files; and
4. **extracts** each file's readable data, running every recovered block
   through the Stage 5/6 integrity pipeline and emitting only blocks that pass
   to a caller-supplied `RescueSink` — a block that fails integrity is skipped
   and counted, **never handed back** (§6).

`rescue` returns a structured `RescueReport` (roots found, the chosen
generation, files mapped, blocks extracted, blocks skipped, unreadable inodes)
and logs its outcome with a stable event ID. Because the driver owns no
destination filesystem, extraction streams recovered plaintext blocks to the
`RescueSink` the caller provides (a recovery host writes them to a safe
volume).

## TRIM / discard (`arxfs-spec.md` §11, §15.10)

`arxfs` returns freed space to the backing device **safely**: a block is
discarded only once it is unreachable from every retained root, snapshot,
reflink, deduped extent, and recovery root. The hard constraint is that discard
may **never** destroy data reachable from any of those (`arxfs-spec.md` §11).
There is no `nodiscard` / `trim=off` mode.

**The block-device discard capability.** The `Block` ABI exposes two methods
(an `abi-v1` extension, not a widening of the frozen read/write surface,
`AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9): `discard_capability()` reports whether the device
supports discard, its granularity, and a per-request block cap; `discard(lba,
blocks)` issues one aligned discard. A device **without** discard support is
*recorded, not failed* — both default to "unsupported" so a backend that cannot
trim simply reports so.

**The pending-discard queue (mounted trim).** Freed runs enter a transient,
in-memory pending-discard queue as a committed transaction reclaims them
(`finish_txn`), reusing the existing deferred-free machinery rather than a
second free-tracking mechanism (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The queue holds coalesced
`(start, length)` runs, so one large free is one entry and its cap is on runs
(`MAX_PENDING_DISCARD_RUNS`) — the queue's actual memory — rather than on
blocks. `ARXFS::trim` later issues the discards:

- **Safety by re-check.** A queued block is discarded only if it is **still
  free** at trim time. The allocation map marks every block reachable from the
  committed root — including every reflink target and every deduped chunk at
  refcount ≥ 1 — as *used*, so a free block is, by construction, unreachable
  from every retained root. A block freed and then reallocated is *used* again
  by trim time and is skipped, never discarded. Each queued run is split
  against the live map into the parts that are still free, page-wise rather
  than block by block.
- **Batched, aligned, rate-limited.** Each still-free part is aligned
  **inward** to the device's discard granularity (the unaligned head/tail edges
  are requeued), and at most `TRIM_BATCH_RANGES` runs are issued per call; the
  remainder stays queued for the next call.
- **No zero-readback assumption.** `arxfs` never reads a discarded block
  expecting zeroes; discarded blocks are free and are fully rewritten (header +
  integrity + crypto) before they are ever read again.

The queue is **rebuildable, transient state** (`arxfs-spec.md` §4): it is never
persisted, so a crash mid-trim simply drops it — the volume remounts cleanly,
the queue is empty, and no live data is lost. `trim` is **capability-gated** on
`CAP_FS_MOUNT` (fail-closed, `AGENTS.md` §5.4) and returns a structured
`TrimReport` (whether discard is supported, ranges and blocks discarded, blocks
skipped as still-in-use, and blocks deferred to a later pass), logging its
outcome with a stable event ID in the `arxfs` `12000..13000` range.

**mkfs-time discard.** On a discard-capable device, `format` issues a
full-range discard before laying down the encrypted structures (open device →
read discard capability → full-range discard when supported → create structures
→ flush). A device without discard support is recorded, not failed: a fresh
volume is still created and mounts.

## Device health and health-triggered scrub (`arxfs-spec.md` §11, §15.11)

`arxfs` keeps a notion of the volume's health so it can decide *when* a scrub
is worth running, rather than only running one on demand. It reuses the seams
the earlier stages built (`AGENTS.md` §2.2) and never adds a second integrity
or scrub path.

**The block-device health surface.** The `Block` ABI exposes
`device_health() -> DeviceHealth` (an `abi-v1` extension alongside the discard
surface, never a widening of the frozen read/write methods, `AGENTS.md` §2.4 /
§9). It returns either `Available(HealthSnapshot)` — the SMART / NVMe-style
counters (power-on hours, unsafe shutdowns, media/data-integrity errors,
reallocated/pending/uncorrectable sectors, interface CRC errors, wear,
available spare, temperature, a device critical-warning bit) — or
`Unavailable`. The two states are distinct so "no data" is never confused with
"all counters zero"; a device without telemetry is *recorded, not failed* and
the health subsystem stays enabled (§11). The default implementation reports
`Unavailable`, so a backend with no telemetry needs no code.

**The persisted baseline.** A self-identifying `BlockType::HealthBaseline`
block, reached from the transaction root (exactly like the Stage-8
scrub-progress record), stores the **last clean device-health snapshot** the
next pass compares against, plus the volume's **accumulated
filesystem-observed fault counters** — metadata copy-repairs, bad copies left
as they were (declined by a read-only handle or refused by the device), and
both-copies-bad blocks (the Stage-3 companion-repair seam) and per-class data
faults (`Physical` / `Aead` / `Logical`, the Stage-5 seam). Both are
**persisted**, not rebuildable (§4): a transient fault that was repaired leaves
no trace in the live trees, so the count is only durable if it is written down.
A bad copy a read path meets outside a scrub — an ordinary metadata read, or
the mount's repair of the slot and root it chose — is tallied on the handle and
folded in by the next pass; a scrub's findings travel in its own report, so
none is counted twice.
The block is the single source of truth; `format` stores the initial baseline
at mkfs time, and a crash mid-update leaves the previous committed baseline (or
none) selected and never blocks a mount (§14). A corrupt baseline is simply
re-established at the next clean pass (§4), never a mount failure.

**The report and thresholds.** `ARXFS::health` returns a structured
`HealthReport` (mirroring `ScrubReport` / `CheckReport` / `TrimReport`) that
classifies the volume against the documented `HealthThresholds::DEFAULT` —
`Healthy`, `Degraded`, or `Failing` — taking the worse of the device-reported
signal and the accumulated filesystem-observed signal. The thresholds are
explicit, named, and inspectable, with no magic numbers buried in code
(`AGENTS.md` §2.1 / §11): a single repaired metadata block, a single data
fault, or any device media error raises a watch-level (`Degraded`) signal,
while accumulated faults, a device critical warning, exhausted spare, or
worn-out media raise an act-now (`Failing`) signal. Critical single-device
health additionally sets `read_only_recommended` (§11).

**Health-triggered scrub.** When the device's unsafe-shutdown counter has risen
since the baseline a metadata scrub is scheduled; when its media-error counter
has risen a deep scrub is scheduled (§11). `health` acts on the recommendation
by running the **Stage-8 `scrub`** — its `CAP_FS_MOUNT` gate, its budget, its
resumable/interrupt-safe core — never a parallel verifier (`AGENTS.md` §2.2),
and folds the scrub's findings into the accumulated counters. It then stores
the current telemetry as the new baseline so the next pass measures a fresh
delta (a pass with no new device activity triggers no scrub).

**On a read-only handle it stores no baseline** and returns the reading anyway
(`arxfs-spec.md` §12): like the scrub it may trigger, it writes nothing to the
medium it holds, and the next pass simply measures its delta from the same
stored baseline. A mirror that scrub found damaged but could not rewrite
classifies the volume exactly as a repaired one would, so a read-only volume
with degraded mirrors reports `Degraded` rather than a clean bill.

`health` is **capability-gated** on `CAP_FS_MOUNT` (the mount-management
capability that already gates scrub/check/trim; fail-closed and logged
otherwise, `AGENTS.md` §5.4) and logs its classification — and any triggered
scrub — through `lib/log` with stable event IDs in the `arxfs`
`12000..13000` range (`HEALTH_OK` / `HEALTH_DEGRADED` / `HEALTH_FAILING` /
`HEALTH_SCRUB_TRIGGERED` / `HEALTH_DENIED`).

## Volume statistics

The driver implements the versioned `FilesystemStats` extension
(`stats() -> VolumeStats`, a separate `abi-v1` trait alongside the
others — never a widening, `AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9). The report is a pure
read of the mounted volume's in-memory accounting — the block size, the
committed `total_blocks`, and the live free count — with
`avail_blocks` withholding the metadata reserve that keeps a full
volume repairable (data allocation stops at the reserve, so consumers
are never promised space the allocator would refuse). Inodes are
B-tree records allocated on demand, so there is no fixed table to
count: `files`/`files_free` carry the honest `0`/`0` "untracked" pair,
exactly as the trait defines. These are the figures the kernel mount
snapshot and the `sysinfo-v1` `MOUNT_LIST` rows carry, and `df`
renders.

## Timestamps (§21)

Each inode stores the three 64-bit-native `Time64` timestamps `arxfs`
maintains — `created`, `modified`, and `changed` — so absolute time is
never a seconds-only scalar and the full pre-1970 / post-2038 range
round-trips without truncation (`AGENTS.md` §21). **`arxfs` does not
track access time (atime).** Updating a stamp on every read would defeat
the copy-on-write model (a pure read would have to write metadata), so
the format deliberately keeps no atime: it reports `accessed =
Time64::UNIX_EPOCH` — the honest "no stamp" value, never a fabricated or
stale time. The on-disk inode record reserves the 12-byte atime slot
(written zero, ignored on read) so the surrounding offsets stay fixed.

The three stamps travel **in `NodeInfo`** (`node_info` and `read_dir`
both fill `NodeInfo::times`), read in the same structural read as the
node's kind and size — there is no separate `FilesystemTimestamps` trait
and no separate `DirEntry.modified` stamp (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

The driver stamps them from a clock seam installed with
`ARXFS::with_clock(clock: fn() -> Time64)`; without it every stamp is
the Unix epoch, so a board with no wall clock yet keeps deterministic,
in-range timestamps rather than panicking or inventing a time
(`AGENTS.md` §2.9). The stamping follows the POSIX model:

- **create** sets `created`/`modified`/`changed` to the creation instant
  and bumps the parent directory's `modified`/`changed`;
- **write** advances `modified`/`changed`;
- **truncate** advances `modified`/`changed`;
- **set_security** advances only `changed` (a metadata change);
- **remove** bumps the parent directory's `modified`/`changed`.

`created` is set once and never changed. Installing a different clock
never rewrites timestamps already on disk.

## Copy-on-write metadata trees

Both scalable metadata structures are the **same** generic copy-on-write
B-tree (`src/btree.rs`), keyed by `u64` (`AGENTS.md` §2.2 — one
implementation, not two). Each tree node is one self-identifying metadata
block (`BlockType::Btree`); a leaf holds `(key, value)` records in key order
and an internal node holds `(separator, child)` records, where the separator
is the smallest key in the child.

- **Inode tree.** Keyed by inode number, value the 256-byte inode record. It
  supersedes Stage 1's two-level inode map and removes the format-time
  `inode_count` cap — the tree grows as inodes are created. The transaction
  root names the tree's root block and the next inode number to hand out.
- **Extent tree.** One per file, keyed by logical block offset, value a
  `(physical start, run length)` extent. It supersedes the 12-direct +
  single-indirect map; a lookup is a floor query that finds the run covering
  an offset, and a sequential write merges into the adjacent run so the map
  stays compact.

Reading more than one record goes through one primitive, a **bounded resumable
walk** (`TreeWalk`): a step descends one root-to-leaf path and yields that
leaf's records into the walk's own block-sized buffer, so an operation over a
tree of any size holds a node's worth of bytes and allocates nothing per step.
Its position is a single key, which is what lets a caller mutate the tree
between steps — truncation frees run by run as it goes — and lets a long pass
stop, persist that key, and resume in a later call with the sequence an
uninterrupted walk would have produced. A caller that must reach every *node*
rather than every record — the allocation-map rebuild marking them used, the
scrub verifying them — takes them from the walk's path as it moves
(`NodeTrail`), which reports each node as the walk enters it. Nothing
materialises a tree's records or its node list, so a stat, a truncate, a delete,
a scrub step, or a mount-time rebuild costs the same resident bytes on a
100 TB volume as on a small one (`arxfs-spec.md` §4). A tree whose shape is
impossible — a level that does not decrease, an entry count wider than its
block, keys that do not ascend within a leaf — is refused as a device fault
rather than read past a buffer, descended forever, or walked part-way and
reported complete.

Mutations copy-on-write the touched node to a fresh (or transaction-private)
block and bubble the change up to a new root; nodes split on overflow and
borrow-or-merge on underflow, all `Result`-based and panic-free with no
`unsafe`. They are **iterative and bounded in the stack too**: an insert or a
remove descends once recording the path, edits the leaf in place, and walks back
up rewriting each ancestor, taking its node buffers from one scratch (`TreeEdit`)
the mount lends it — the node being rewritten plus the adjacent pair a split,
borrow, or merge moves entries between. So a mutation's frame is a few hundred
bytes whatever the tree's depth, it allocates nothing in the steady state and
nothing per record, and it costs the same device reads as the recursive form it
replaced. Each level it re-enters on the way up is validated as the descent
validates it, so an impossible tree is refused on the write path as on the read
path rather than descended until the guard page stops it. Block allocation draws file **data** upward from the low end of the
pool and **metadata** downward from the high end, with a small metadata
reserve so a delete can always copy-on-write itself and commit even on an
otherwise-full volume.

Free space itself is **not** tracked by walking these trees at every mount.
An on-disk **paged allocation map** — a bitmap with a per-page free-count
summary, sealed under `BlockType::AllocMap` and updated **in place** rather
than copy-on-written — sits in a fixed region above the superblock ring. A
mount **adopts** the map with a handful of reads when it authenticates at the
address the committed transaction root names and its clean/dirty stamp shows
no update was left in flight; otherwise it falls back to the same tree walk
(every inode-tree node, then each inode's extent-tree nodes and the physical
runs they map) that built the map in the first place. Because the map is
rebuildable, non-authoritative state, in-place update never risks the
authoritative trees, and a read-only mount skips it entirely — it builds no
allocation state at all (`arxfs-spec.md` §4).

The first mutation after a clean sync stages an invalid stamp with the
authoritative transaction blocks, so the commit's existing barrier makes that
stamp durable before any in-place map page can land. Map pages remain in the
bounded cache between commits, then move into the same dirty set for bounded
run writes at `fs_sync`; that sync issues one barrier before restoring the
clean generation stamp. A page evicted earlier uses the same set and cannot be
written until invalidation is durable. A failed page write or barrier — under a
sync or under an eviction — invalidates the in-memory derivation; the next
allocating operation rebuilds it from the committed trees before proceeding.

A device fault is the *only* thing that provokes that rebuild. A failed
operation instead undoes its own marks — reserving the frees it deferred,
releasing the blocks it claimed, and reclaiming the private blocks it released —
so a failure costs the operation and never the volume. Otherwise an operation
refused for an ordinary reason, such as a `create` over a name already taken,
would make the next one walk every tree on the volume, which is unbounded read
amplification from a call that changes nothing.

## Copy-on-write and the superblock ring

`arxfs` keeps metadata and data consistent across a crash without
`fsck` (`AGENTS.md` §2.5). Every operation is a transaction, and a block
reachable from the last committed transaction root is **never overwritten
in place**:

- **Copy-on-write everywhere.** A modified metadata or data block is
  written to a freshly allocated block; the block that referenced it is
  itself copy-on-written to point at the new location, up to the inode
  map. Blocks superseded by the transaction are *deferred-freed* — marked
  reusable only after the transaction commits — so the previous committed
  tree stays wholly intact until the new one is durable. The deferred set
  records **runs**, not blocks (`arxfs-spec.md` §4), so releasing a file costs
  one entry per extent it maps rather than one per block.
- **Freeing spans transactions** (`arxfs-spec.md` §14). A file's extent count is
  itself unbounded, so an unlink stops on an extent boundary once its
  transaction has reached the write-back ceiling and publishes before taking
  another step. What makes that resumable is the **pending-delete set** a
  transaction root names: a tree of the inode numbers whose last name has gone
  and whose blocks are not all freed. The name's removal and the set entry are
  published together, so a crash mid-delete leaves an unreachable inode the set
  names — and the next writable mount finishes it before it serves. An ordinary
  delete is still one transaction, because the operation that detaches the name
  takes the first step itself; a hard-linked node with names left is not in the
  set at all, and a node the set names can never be given a new name. A
  `truncate` needs no set entry: it frees downward and publishes the shorter
  size at each boundary, so an interrupted one is a shorter file rather than one
  of its original length with holes where its data was.
- **Commit order (`docs/src/filesystem/arxfs-spec.md` §14).** Write the copy-on-write
  blocks, write the new transaction root carrying its inline commit
  record, then publish the next superblock-ring slot (round-robin)
  pointing at that root. `open` scans the ring and selects the
  highest-generation slot whose root *and* commit record validate. A
  crash before the slot is published leaves the previous committed root
  selected; a crash mid-publish overwrites only the oldest ring slot, so
  the most recent committed root always survives — the mount lands on a
  whole transaction boundary, never a torn one.
- **The barrier that makes the order real** (`arxfs-spec.md` §22).
  Issuing the writes in that order is only half the guarantee: a device
  with a volatile write cache may commit them to media in any order, so
  the slot could become durable while an interior tree node beneath its
  root is not, and the mount would then fail closed. Every commit
  therefore drains the blocks it wrote, issues one `Block::flush()`, and
  only then writes the slot — one barrier is sufficient, because the root
  is just another block that must be durable before the slot naming it.
  When a commit returns, the only authoritative blocks a device may still hold
  are that slot's two copies, so a power cut selects the prior committed state
  or the new one, both whole. An explicit `fs_sync` drains rebuildable map
  pages and issues one further barrier, making them and the slot durable before
  it returns.
- **The commit point is one block write.** The slot's two mirror copies go
  out companion-first, so the *primary* — the copy a mount prefers — is the
  last write of the commit and a half-written pair publishes nothing.
  Anything that fails before it rolls the transaction back. A failure *of*
  those writes leaves publication genuinely unknown, since the device may
  have taken one copy: the handle forces itself read-only rather than
  guessing, freeing nothing, so whichever root the device holds survives
  for the next mount to read.
- **One dirty layer, beneath the one device-write seam.** A transaction's
  sealed blocks and allocation-map pages use a physical-block-keyed dirty set,
  separated into pre- and post-barrier ordering phases,
  so the repeated copy-on-writes of one B-tree node cost one device write
  rather than one each — measured at 746 device writes down to 158 for a
  64 KiB write on a 512-byte volume. The set is read-through, so a
  read-after-write inside the transaction sees the staged bytes; it drops a
  block the transaction frees again unwritten. Resident map pages move into
  the set instead of remaining as a second copy; their drain window is bounded
  below the cache footprint. Transient verification scratch arrays and an
  idempotent mirror copy-repair go straight to the device because neither
  participates in publication.
- **The drain hands the device runs, not blocks.** Data blocks are allocated
  consecutively and mirrored metadata blocks are adjacent pairs, so the
  set's ascending order gathers into contiguous runs and each run is one
  `write_blocks` — bounded by the same 64 KiB transfer window the read path
  gathers to, from the one shared definition. Those same 158 blocks now cost
  **five** commands rather than 158, and an empty-file create after a clean
  mkfs costs four commands for fifteen blocks; the bytes are otherwise
  untouched, only the commands and their completion waits fall. A run stops at
  the first address the set does not
  hold, so it can never name a block outside the transaction or run past the
  end of the device. The gather buffer is one fallible reservation sized to
  the transaction's longest run, wiped on drop, and a machine too short of
  memory to hold it writes block by block rather than failing the commit.
- **A transaction spans operations.** It stays open and the next operation
  joins it, so a burst of small writes costs one transaction root, one ring
  slot, one barrier, and one write of each metadata block they all rewrite,
  rather than one of each per call — the same 64 KiB in sixteen calls then puts
  exactly the blocks and bytes on the device that one call does. It closes on
  an explicit `fs_sync`, on the dirty-age window expiring, on an operation that
  needs the committed state to be the whole truth (`trim`, `grow`, `scrub`,
  `check`, `health`, or widening the incompatible-feature word), or on the
  volume being handed on. The window is one policy over the device class the
  block seam reports — widest for removable flash, smallest for a device
  already cheap per command.
- **The host publishes a volume that falls quiet.** Nothing in the driver runs
  between operations, so the driver names each transaction's deadline to the
  host's write-back timer as the transaction opens and names its absence as it
  closes; the kernel parks until the soonest deadline any mounted volume
  published and then calls the ordinary `fs_sync` on each that is due
  (`kernel/core::fs::writeback`). That is what makes the recency bound a bound
  in *time*, not merely in content. Nothing polls, the timer is armed once per
  batch, and a machine with no dirty volume takes no wakeup. A handle given
  neither clock nor timer — a boot-time reader, a port with no storage floor —
  publishes at every operation rather than deferring durability it can neither
  measure nor have fired.
- **A failed operation is undone alone.** Everything it changes in the staged
  set and the private-block bookkeeping is recorded as it changes and replayed
  backwards, so the operations that already joined the transaction — and were
  reported successful — are left exactly as they were. A failed *commit* is the
  wider undo: it abandons the whole transaction back to the last published
  root, and a handle that had reported operations into it forces itself
  read-only rather than serving writes it can no longer honour.
- **The set is pinned, so it is bounded by back-pressure rather than by
  eviction.** A staged block exists nowhere else: it can be written out but
  never dropped, so it is not admitted through the reclaim classification gate
  (whose contract is droppability) and nothing may shrink it behind the
  driver's back. Its byte ceiling is instead derived from the RAM the host
  discovered — a documented fraction of it — and it is the *machine's* ceiling,
  which the mounted volumes share: each may hold an equal share of it, capped
  further by what the volumes already holding leave and by the machine-wide
  reserve floor every consumer obeys. A per-volume figure would be a multiple of
  the machine as soon as the machine had several volumes, and pinned bytes are
  the ones nothing can reclaim. A volume holding nothing counts for nothing, so
  a machine whose other volumes are empty leaves the whole ceiling to the one
  writing.
  Reaching the ceiling publishes the transaction, so a writer that outruns the
  device waits for real I/O. The ceiling counts the transaction's run bookkeeping with its
  staged blocks: a delete holds almost all of its memory in runs and dirties a
  spine's worth of blocks whatever the file's extent count, so a ceiling over
  the blocks alone would not bound one. Measured, deleting a maximally
  fragmented file holds 88 600 bytes at 1 200 extents and 110 368 at 4 800,
  where doing it inside one transaction holds 448 448 and grows with the file.
  Measured across volumes, four 100 TiB volumes writing at once peak together
  at 4 195 744 bytes against a 4 194 304-byte machine ceiling — that ceiling
  plus a fraction of one record — where a per-volume ceiling let the same four
  reach 8 670 016, twice the machine's.
- **Pressure lowers the ceiling and shortens the window, to a floor and no
  further.** Band by band the ceiling falls and the dirty-age window halves,
  down to one coalesced device transfer: the answer to a tightening machine is
  always to publish sooner, never to hold more and never to drop. Below that
  floor the drain could not form a full run, so a machine whose ceiling cannot
  reach it refuses the mount rather than leaving it to commit after almost
  every record. Forward progress does not depend on the ceiling: a write
  stores at least one record whatever it is, then stops on a record boundary
  and reports the count, exactly as `write(2)` may — `write_all` on the driver
  ABI is the one place that loop lives for callers that need every byte
  stored. The pinned bytes are published as their own row in the System
  Information cache-ledger export, kept out of the per-class reclaim totals
  because memory that can only be written out is not headroom.

## Operations

`FilesystemRead` provides `root`/`node_info`/`lookup`/`read_at`/`read_dir`;
`FilesystemWrite` provides `create`/`write_at`/`truncate`/`remove`/`flush`,
addressing a target as a `(dir, name)` pair. `write_at` extends files
(zero-filling sparse gaps), `truncate` shrinks (freeing the tail from the high
end down and copy-on-write zeroing the partial last block) or grows, and
`remove` refuses a non-empty directory with `DirectoryNotEmpty`. Both may take
several transactions over a very large file and report a failure part-way: a
`truncate` then leaves the file at the last boundary it reached, and a `remove`
leaves the name gone and the node named by the pending-delete set for the next
unlink or mount to finish. A `NodeId` is the
inode index;
node identity is stable across a remount. The driver additionally exposes
`ARXFS::reflink(dir, src, dst)` — a copy-on-write clone that shares the
source's data chunks until a side is written (see *Deduplication*) — as an
inherent operation, not a widening of a frozen ABI trait (`AGENTS.md` §2.4).

## End-to-end QEMU vertical

`tests/integration/arxfs_virtio_blk_pci_x86_64` exercises the driver
against a **real (emulated) virtio-blk-pci device** under QEMU. It boots
the production kernel pipeline, brings the block device online through
the same shared bring-up the virtio-blk and FAT32 verticals use, then
mounts a planted arxfs volume through `ARXFS::open` (with the fixture's
shared volume key), verifies the
planted file reads back its known contents, and creates + writes + reads
back a fresh file before signalling success.

The on-disk image is built by the shared `tairix-test-arxfs-image`
fixture (a 1 MiB, 512-byte-block, 64-inode volume). Unlike the
hand-encoded FAT32 fixture, the arxfs image is authored by the **real
arxfs driver itself** — the fixture formats an in-memory volume through
`ARXFS::format` and plants the file through the driver's own write path
— so the fixture and the driver can never disagree about the on-disk
format (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The host harness (`cargo xtask test --qemu`)
plants exactly that image on the backing disk, and the freestanding guest
tail names the same planted and to-be-written files through the fixture's
constants. The device tail (`arxfs_round_trip`) is generic over the
virtio transport, so a riscv64 MMIO sibling runs identical code.

## Capabilities

Loading requires `CAP_DRV_LOAD` at `register` time. The driver runs in
user space; it does not request `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`. The read/write methods
are reached only through the `DriverHandle` the host minted at load time,
and the VFS only delegates a write to a non-`READ_ONLY` mount.

## Test surface

`cargo test -p tairix-drv-fs-arxfs` formats an in-memory volume and
exercises: the self-identifying block header rejecting a wrong magic,
wrong type, wrong expected address, foreign UUID, a flipped payload byte,
and a wrong authenticator key; a metadata bit-flip being **detected and
repaired** from the companion mirror, a one-copy superblock corruption still
mounting via the mirror, and both copies corrupt failing closed;
`format`/`open` round-trip and rejection of an unformatted device;
create/lookup/listing across nested directories; read/write with
block-boundary straddling; extent-backed large files across a remount;
inode-tree growth and shrink (split, borrow, and merge) across many inodes;
a file with many non-contiguous extents that splits its extent tree; a large
contiguous write collapsing to a single extent; the allocation-map rebuild
matching the authoritative live set; `truncate` keeping the surviving
prefix; `remove` reclaiming space so a full volume can allocate again; the
fail-closed extremes
(`AlreadyExists`/`DirectoryNotEmpty`/`LengthOutOfRange`/`NotFound`); the
Stage-4 encryption acceptance
tests — a **wrong key refusing the mount** (`PermissionDenied`, never a
panic) while the right key still mounts, a distinctive filename and file
content being **absent from the raw on-disk bytes** (no plaintext at rest),
a filename and file data **round-tripping through encryption across a
remount**, and a **bit-flip in an encrypted data block being detected** on
read; the Stage-5 data-integrity acceptance tests — a data block's three
integrity layers (physical checksum, AEAD, logical hash) each detecting
**its own** class of corruption and all failing closed, identical plaintext
sharing **one logical hash** while different plaintext differs (the dedupe
seam) — identical content now also sharing one physical chunk (refcount 2)
while distinct content does not — and the
integrity field surviving a remount and a copy-on-write rewrite; the Stage-6
compression acceptance tests — an **incompressible record stored raw** and
reading back byte-identical, a **compressible file shrinking its at-rest
footprint** yet reading back byte-identical across a remount and a COW
rewrite, and the integrity layers still catching a physical and a logical
corruption on a **compressed** block; the Stage-7 dedupe acceptance tests —
two files with identical content **sharing one physical chunk** (refcount 2)
while distinct content does not, **byte-verify-before-share** refusing an
injected colliding index entry, overwriting one sharer **copying-on-write** a
fresh chunk and leaving the other intact, a **reflink** sharing chunks until a
side is written, **refcount-to-zero freeing** the chunk with the allocation
map agreeing, the **dedupe index warming** from writes and yielding the same
sharing, dedupe staying **within the
encryption domain**, and integrity + compression still holding on a **shared**
chunk across a remount and a COW rewrite; the Stage-8 online-scrub acceptance
tests — a **clean scrub** of a populated volume reporting zero faults and
changing nothing (idempotent), scrub **detecting and repairing** a single-copy
metadata corruption from its companion and reporting the repair, scrub
**detecting and classifying** an injected data-block `Physical` and `Logical`
fault without panicking, scrub **detecting and correcting** an injected
refcount and a reverse-reference divergence against the on-disk chunk trees,
scrub being **resumable** (a budgeted one-inode-per-call pass reaching the same
result as one uninterrupted pass and clearing its cursor on completion) with a
**crash mid-scrub still mounting** and resuming, a **shared chunk accounted
once** with the dedupe domain preserved, the scrub being **capability-gated**
on `CAP_FS_MOUNT` (refused and logged otherwise), and integrity + compression +
dedupe invariants still holding across a scrub, a remount, and a COW rewrite;
the Stage-9 offline check/rescue acceptance tests — a **clean check** reporting
a sound structure and rebuilding nothing (idempotent, changing nothing on
disk), check **rebuilding** a deliberately corrupted allocation map and
dedupe-index derivation from the authoritative trees with the volume staying
mountable, check **reclaiming an orphaned inode** and **correcting a refcount
divergence** while **reporting** an unrepairable data fault it cannot safely
fix, check being **capability-gated**, `rescue` **discovering a valid root and
extracting** files from a volume whose superblock ring is wounded (and being
read-only/repeatable), and `rescue` **never emitting a block that fails** the
Stage 5/6 integrity pipeline while still recovering the good blocks; the
Stage-11 device-health acceptance tests — `health` being **capability-gated**
on `CAP_FS_MOUNT` (refused and logged otherwise), a device **without telemetry**
still classifying and persisting a baseline that survives a remount, the
classification crossing **healthy → degraded → failing** as the device's
media-error count climbs across mounts, an **unsafe-shutdown delta triggering a
scrub** through the Stage-8 machinery (and the advanced baseline triggering no
further scrub), and the persisted baseline **surviving a crash** at every write
count during its update with no live data lost; the
per-inode security record and
the four §21 `Time64` timestamps (incl. pre-1970 and far-future)
round-tripping across a remount; superblock-ring selection of the
highest committed generation; and a **crash-replay sweep** that faults the
device after every possible write count during a single committing
transaction and asserts the re-opened volume always mounts, the
pre-existing file is always intact, and the in-flight write is either
fully applied or fully absent — never torn.

The allocation-map ordering tests additionally fail the first map-page write,
fail the sync barrier after pages enter a volatile cache, retain none, all, or
alternating page subsets, and retain or lose the publishing slot. Every case
rebuilds from the selected transaction root to the exact used set and free
count; a clean sync remains directly adoptable. Same-handle tests continue with
check, write, and grow after a failed sync, proving each rebuilds before it
consults the poisoned map.

The Stage-12 suites are the adversarial superset of all of the above
(`arxfs-spec.md` §15.12, §16; `AGENTS.md` §7 / §19.6), reusing the same seams
rather than adding a second integrity, scrub, or decode path (`AGENTS.md`
§2.2). The crash-replay sweep is **generalised to every commit step across
every representative transaction** — create, write, truncate, remove, reflink,
scrub, check, trim, and health: each is faulted at every write-budget cut-off
and the re-opened volume must always mount on a whole transaction boundary,
with the operation's effect fully present or fully absent (never torn) and the
witness file never lost. The **corruption-injection suite** systematically
wounds each on-disk structure class — superblock-ring slot, transaction root,
the inode / extent / chunk / reverse-reference B-trees, a directory block, the
scrub-progress and health-baseline records, and each data-integrity layer — in
**one** copy and in **both** copies, asserting the documented seam behaviour: a
single bad copy is always repaired from the companion mirror (mounts, scrub
reports nothing unrepairable, check is sound, data intact); both copies of
mount-critical metadata never tear (the mount fails closed or recovers an
earlier whole, consistent committed root through the superblock ring); a
both-copies-bad directory still mounts but reads fail closed and scrub records
it unrepairable; the transient scrub-progress/health-baseline records recover
gracefully (scrub restarts, health re-derives); and an unmirrored data block's
fault is detected, classified by its `DataFault` layer, and surfaced as a
fail-closed `DeviceFault`, never silently repaired.

The **sparse-file acceptance tests** (`arxfs-spec.md` §19, `plans/SPARSE.md`
§17) cover all ten mandatory cases: a 10 MiB all-zero file reporting a 10 MiB
logical size while mapping **zero** data blocks (and reading back zero across a
remount — also the encrypted-volume case, no plaintext payload); a non-zero
write into a hole splitting the extent map around the data while the
surroundings stay zero (ordered, non-overlapping); overwriting data with zeroes
turning the block into a hole while a reflink keeps seeing the old data;
`truncate` up creating a hole and down freeing only the real data extents;
a reflink preserving holes metadata-only and creating no chunk for a zero range;
scrub and check validating a sparse file's metadata with no physical read for a
hole; and an all-zero record bypassing compression while a repeated non-zero
constant still compresses.

The mount / metadata-decode path additionally has a `cargo xtask fuzz`
harness (`fuzz_mount`, `AGENTS.md` §19.6): a per-byte flip sweep over a
valid image (which also drives the authenticate-then-fall-back-to-mirror
path), a duplicated-copy sweep that corrupts *both* copies of each block
pair, and a per-run-seeded PRNG all drive `ARXFS::open` over arbitrary bytes,
asserting it never panics and fails closed. Because each input mounts and
fully re-checks an encrypted volume — far heavier than a byte decoder — a
plain `cargo test` (a developer machine and the per-PR `ci` gate, no budget)
runs a single quick smoke pass: a small, seed-driven sample of the byte sweep
plus a bounded PRNG batch, from a fresh, logged seed; the time-limited GitHub
soak (`cargo xtask fuzz`, `TAIRIX_FUZZ_BUDGET_SECS`) switches to exhaustive
coverage — every byte flipped in turn and the PRNG loop run to the wall-clock
budget. Since Stage 7 the fuzz image is
populated with duplicate-content files and a reflink, so the sweep also drives
the **chunk/refcount** and **reverse-reference** record decode paths the
dedupe index warms from. Since Stage 8 the base image is left with
a **paused scrub**, and each successful mount additionally runs a bounded
`scrub`, so the sweep also drives the **scrub-progress** record decode path
(`load_scrub_progress`), asserting it too never panics and fails closed. Since
Stage 9 each successful mount additionally runs the offline `check`, and every
image (mountable or not) is also fed to `ARXFS::rescue`, so the sweep drives
the **transaction-root scan** (`TxnRoot::decode_any`) and the rescue extraction
pipeline over arbitrary bytes, asserting both never panic and fail closed. Since
Stage 11 the fuzz device reports SMART-style telemetry and each successful mount
additionally runs `health`, so the sweep drives the **health-baseline** record
decode path too, asserting it never panics and fails closed. Since Stage 12
each successful mount additionally **walks every reachable directory**
(`read_dir`/`lookup`, bounded), driving the spec's required "directory decode"
target — the encrypted dirent payload the free-space rebuild walk never
reads — and asserting it never panics and fails closed. The
first-party compression codec
has its own `cargo xtask fuzz` harness (`fuzz_compress`, in `lib/compress`):
the spec's required "compression decode" target (`arxfs-spec.md` §10,
`AGENTS.md` §19.6), it round-trips structured inputs and feeds corrupted
frames and pure noise to `tairix_compress::decompress`, asserting it never
panics and fails closed.

The **write path's cost is measured, not described** (`arxfs-spec.md` §22,
`plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` §1). An in-RAM device records every command the
driver issues it, in order — each write's start block and run length, and each
cache barrier — and a baseline asserts, exactly, what a single-call 64 KiB
write, the same bytes in sixteen calls, a 34-byte append, and a metadata-only
create each cost at both block sizes: the commands, the blocks they carry, how
many of those a later write supersedes, the bytes, and the write amplification.
It also holds the write-back cache's contract — a transaction writes each
authoritative block once, the shared dirty set drains one request per physical
run, each ordinary commit and sync issues one barrier, and map pages are ordered
behind durable invalidation. A second baseline prices the same workloads
*batched*, where the calls of one window join a single transaction, and asserts
what the commit scheduler is for: sixteen calls then put the same blocks and the
same bytes on the device as one call does, behind one barrier, with nothing
superseded. The same workloads on a 100 TiB volume produce an identical command
stream, so the figures are properties of the write path and not of the device
measured on.

The `pjdfstest`-equivalent POSIX suite remains tracked in
`plans/WIRING.md`.

## Extended file metadata

ARXFS implements the versioned `FilesystemAttrs` ABI: every inode has a
namespaced, encrypted, mirrored copy-on-write extended-attribute store, and the
`lib/fsmeta` preset registry preserves foreign per-file metadata (Acorn, Amiga,
Atari, classic Mac) across a copy. The on-disk model, the fixed bounds, the
capability rules, and the cross-filesystem preservation contract are specified
in `arxfs-spec.md` §21; the value encodings are in the metadata-registry
reference page.
