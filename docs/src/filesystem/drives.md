# TAIRiX Storage Namespaces, Volume Roots, and Aliases

This is the binding TAIRiX storage-namespace specification. It supersedes the
AI-facing design brief `plans/DRIVES.md` (which remains only as source
material) and is binding under `AGENTS.md`. Where an earlier informal
description of the filesystem layout disagrees with this page, this page wins.

The one-line decision this page turns into a contract:

> TAIRiX native storage paths are alias-rooted or ID-rooted. `/` is a
> generated **view**, not the root of storage.

## 1. Purpose and non-goals

TAIRiX storage is a **forest of independently addressable named roots**, not a
single global Unix tree. A path names its root explicitly (by human alias or by
stable ID); the familiar `/System`, `/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage` layout is a
convenience *view* projected over that forest, never the identity of storage.
This removes the single-root fault-tolerance weakness of the Unix model: a
healthy volume stays reachable by its stable ID even when the `/` view — or the
volume that used to back it — is absent, corrupt, or deliberately hidden.

Non-goals: this page defines only how storage is **named, discovered,
published, and resolved to a root**. It does not define an on-disk filesystem
format (that is `arxfs-spec.md` and the foreign-FS driver pages), and
resolving a name never opens anything or grants authority — open/read/write
still enforce inode permissions, ACLs, capability gates, mount flags, and MAC
policy (§14, §15).

Explicitly rejected: drive letters (`C:`), Windows `D:relative` semantics,
filesystem type as durable identity, a path string acting as a capability
token, `uid = 0` as an authority shortcut, and any re-creation of `/proc`,
`/sys`, `/mnt`, or `/media` under another name (§25).

## 2. Charter relationship and `AGENTS.md` amendments

- **`AGENTS.md` §16.1 is amended** from "exactly four top-level directories" to
  "exactly four entries in the default session root **view**", backed by the
  first-class aliases `System:`, `Users:`, `Apps:`, and `Storage:`. The
  canonical identity of a storage root becomes its root ID (`id::`) or alias
  path, not the `/` view path. The amendment preserves the existing rules the
  brief lists under "preserve": Rust-only, microkernel-leaning drivers,
  mandatory capabilities, mode-bits+ACL+capability permissions, no `/proc` /
  `/sys`, the secure default mount policy, and the signed driver-store model.
- **`AGENTS.md` §16.2 / §16.3** (`/System`, `/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage`
  contents and mount flags) are **preserved** and reinterpreted as the policy
  of the aliases and view bindings those names project (§14, §15).
- No other charter section changes. In particular §4 (no ambient authority),
  §5 (capabilities), §16.6 (System Information API, not a virtual filesystem),
  and §21 (64-bit time) bind this design unchanged.

Adding a new entry to the default root view, or a new resolver to the closed
`abi-v1` resolver table (§6), remains an `AGENTS.md`-amending, ABI-visible act.

## 3. Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Storage object** | Anything that can hold bytes/blocks: disk, partition, network share, disk image, encrypted container, memory backing, WASM host object. Not necessarily a filesystem. |
| **Filesystem driver** | A driver that interprets an on-disk/remote format (`arxfs`, `fat32`, `ext4`, `iso9660`, `adfs`, …). Implementation detail for normal paths. |
| **Volume root** | The root directory object produced by attaching a filesystem driver to a storage object. Independently addressable; not born under another volume. |
| **Volume ID** | A stable, non-human identifier for a volume root, carried by `lib/abi` as a fixed-size type (§8). |
| **Alias** | A human-facing root binding: a short name mapped to a root or view (`System:`, `Home:`, `Backup:`). Closer to a RISC OS disc name or an Amiga assign than a Unix mountpoint or a drive letter. |
| **Resolver** | The namespace component before `::`; selects how the root selector is interpreted (§6). |
| **View** | A synthetic directory tree assembled from roots, aliases, and service entries. `/` is a view; `Storage:/` is a catalog view. A convenience surface, never canonical identity. |

The word **mount** is not the primary abstraction. The precise verbs are:
`discover` a storage object, `attach` a driver to produce a volume root,
`publish` a root into a namespace, `alias` a root under a human name, and
`project` an alias into a view. "Mount" is retained only as a high-level
operation that may perform attach + publish + alias + view projection — never
"place this device under a directory in `/`".

## 4. Design invariants

1. **Names are not authority.** A path string grants nothing; authority comes
   from capabilities, mode bits, ACLs, manifest grants, and delegated handles.
2. **Storage identity is alias- or ID-rooted**, never the `/` view path.
3. **The failure property (binding):** failure of the `System` volume or the
   default `/` view MUST NOT make an unrelated healthy volume unreachable by
   its stable ID. `open id::<uuid>/path` works in a recovery environment with
   sufficient authority even with no `/` view assembled.
4. **One shared parser.** Exactly one path parser and normalization rule set
   for the whole system (`lib/path`, §12); kernel, shell, GUI, and drivers
   import it — never a second parser (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).
5. **Fail closed** on every ambiguous, missing, unauthorized, or malformed
   input (§11, §22); no production path panics.
6. **Platform-neutral.** No board/SoC/target coupling leaks into this
   generic namespace code (`AGENTS.md` §2.20).

## 5. Path grammar

The user-facing native spelling is `Alias:/path/inside/root`:

```text
System:/Kernel/tairix.rxe
Users:/ian/Documents/design.md
Home:/Documents/spec.md
Apps:/Editor.app/Run
Backup:/snapshots/latest
CameraCard:/DCIM/100MEDIA/IMG_0001.RAW
```

The resolver-qualified spellings, expanded from the shorthand or written
explicitly for durable/administrative use:

```text
alias::Home/Documents/file.txt                              # expanded Alias:/…
id::b7f2e4e6-8d7a-4ef8-a13e-d3b84d4e8001/Documents/file.txt # stable, durable
fs::arxfs/System/Kernel/tairix.rxe                         # explicit driver
arxfs::System/Kernel/tairix.rxe                            # driver shorthand
adfs::HardDisc4/Apps/Paint                                  # driver shorthand
```

Grammar rules:

- `Alias:/` is absolute from the alias root; the alias name is **not** a path
  component. The first `/` after the `:` marks the root boundary.
- A leading `Name:` (single colon) **not** followed by `/` is not a path: it is
  either a resource reference (`namespace:selector`, owned by the separate
  resource-alias grammar) or a malformed alias path, and is rejected.
- `::` names a resolver. The resolver set is closed for `abi-v1` (§6).
- A leading `/` is the synthetic view root; a bare `path` is relative and is
  resolved by the caller against a current directory.
- `:` is a reserved structural delimiter, so a rendered canonical path always
  re-parses to the same typed value.

Normalization: collapse repeated separators; `.` is the current directory; `..`
never escapes above the selected root (a leading `..` in a *relative* path is
preserved for the caller to resolve); component spelling is preserved except
where a filesystem declares case-insensitive or normalizing behaviour; NUL is
rejected everywhere; malformed Windows-like or URL-like strings are never
silently reinterpreted.

Invalid / valid examples:

```text
# invalid
C:foo                  # drive-letter relative syntax
Home:Documents/file    # alias path missing its root slash
alias::::Home/file     # malformed resolver syntax
/../System             # cannot escape the view root
Home:/../../System      # cannot escape the Home root

# valid
Home:/Documents/file.txt
alias::Home/Documents/file.txt
id::b7f2e4e6-8d7a-4ef8-a13e-d3b84d4e8001/Documents/file.txt
arxfs::System/Kernel/tairix.rxe
/Users/ian/Documents/file.txt          # valid view path, not canonical identity
```

## 6. Resolver table

The resolver set is **closed for `abi-v1`**. Adding a resolver is an
ABI-visible, `AGENTS.md`-amending change (§2).

| Resolver | Purpose | User-facing? | Durable? | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `alias::` | Resolve a named alias in the current namespace | Yes | Sometimes | Backing for `Alias:/path` |
| `id::` | Resolve a stable volume/root ID | Rarely | Yes | The durable machine form |
| `fs::` | Explicit filesystem-driver resolver | No | No | Admin / recovery / testing |
| `<driver>::` | Shorthand for `fs::<driver>/…` (e.g. `adfs::`) | No | No | Driver-backed access |
| `net::` | Explicit remote-root resolver | Sometimes | Depends | Usually published as an alias |
| `dev::` | Raw device / storage-object resolver | No | No | Capability-gated diagnostics |
| `view::` | Named synthetic-view resolver | No | No | Namespace-manager / debugging |

There is **no** `proc::` or `sys::` resolver: runtime system information is the
System Information API's job (§16, `AGENTS.md` §16.6), never a namespace tree.

## 7. Alias model

**Classes.** *Machine aliases* (`System:`, `Users:`, `Apps:`, `Storage:`) are
published by the namespace manager from signed policy; *user/session aliases*
(`Home:`, `Desktop:`) are added by the session manager after login and are
scoped to that session; *volume aliases* name a discovered removable/extra
volume; *service aliases* (`Logs:`, `Settings:`, `Recovery:`, `EFI:`) are
published by the owning service.

**Target types.** An alias may bind to a volume root (by ID), to another alias
(indirection, cycle-checked), or to a synthetic view.

**Scopes.** Machine scope (system-wide, capability-published) and session scope
(per-login). A session alias may shadow a machine alias *for that session's
view only*; it never mutates the machine alias table.

**Persistence.** Persistent alias policy is signed (`System:/Security/Policy`)
and loaded at boot; a session alias is ephemeral. Rebuilding the alias table
from discovered volume metadata must produce only safe, unambiguous aliases.

**Conflicts fail closed.** Two volumes claiming the same label do **not**
produce a silent pick: the ambiguous bare alias is refused (`AliasAmbiguous`),
and the volumes remain reachable by `id::` (and by generated disambiguated
display aliases only if policy permits).

## 8. Volume IDs and durable references

A volume ID is a stable, non-human identifier (UUID-shaped or content-derived),
carried by `lib/abi` as a fixed-size `#[repr(C)]` type under the ABI discipline
of `AGENTS.md` §9 (versioned, hashed, frozen on release). `id::<volume-id>/path`
is the durable form for machine records, boot-critical references, recovery
logs, and anywhere a mutable alias is not stable enough. Time-bearing volume
metadata uses `Time64` (`AGENTS.md` §21), never a 32-bit second count.

## 9. Synthetic root view `/`

`/` is a view assembled from the alias namespace. Its default entries are
exactly four, and each is a projection of a machine alias:

```text
/System   -> System:/
/Users    -> Users:/
/Apps     -> Apps:/
/Storage  -> Storage:/     # a catalog/view of published non-core aliases
```

A view binding may only **preserve or restrict** the source root's authority
and mount flags; it may never relax `ro` / `nosuid` / `nodev` / `noexec`
without the explicit relax capability and an audit record (§15). Creating any
additional default-view entry requires amending `AGENTS.md` §16.1.

## 10. Storage catalog `Storage:`

`Storage:/` is a synthetic catalog of published non-core aliases (removable
media, extra disks, network shares), projected into the `/` view as
`/Storage/<name>`. It is a *view projection only*: `/Storage/Backup` is nothing
more than a rendering of `Backup:/`, and `Backup:/file` must open even when the
`Storage:` catalog or the `/` view is absent (§4 invariant 3). `Storage:` is
never a parent volume that other volumes live *inside*.

**Enumeration is landed** (`plans/DEVICES.md` D3d): listing a directory
merges the driver-backed mounts sitting directly beneath it into the
listing (`MountTable::direct_children`, consumed by the `fs_readdir`
service), so a runtime `/Storage/<name>` mount appears in `/Storage` even
though the parent volume holds no node of that name — deduplicated against
any same-named real node, rendered as a structural directory entry with the
same `UNIX_EPOCH` stamp any stampless backing reports. The mount points
follow the volume's own entries in name order, so a batched listing resumes
after the last one it returned.

## 11. Fail-closed rules

A path operation fails closed when: an alias is missing or ambiguous; a
resolver is unknown; a root ID is unavailable; the caller lacks authority to
resolve the root or to traverse/open a component; a view projection would relax
a source root's policy; a filesystem driver reports lossy semantics the caller
did not explicitly accept; a path attempts to escape its root with `..`; or a
driver-specific resolver would bypass normal policy.

## 12. Path parser (`lib/path`)

The single shared parser is `lib/path` (`tairix-path`): `no_std` + `alloc`,
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, linear-time, non-recursive, fail-closed, with fixed
security bounds (`MAX_PATH_LEN`, `MAX_COMPONENTS`, `MAX_COMPONENT_LEN`,
`MAX_ALIAS_LEN` — untrusted-input bounds, not growable capacities,
`AGENTS.md` §24.4). It turns a string into a typed `Path` (a `Root` plus
normalized components) and never resolves, opens, or checks a capability — a
resolved name is still subject to permissions/ACLs/caps/flags/MAC at open time,
so parsing can never widen authority.

**Implemented today.** `Root` covers the spellings with present consumers: the
synthetic view (`/path`), the alias shorthand (`Alias:/path`), the expanded
internal `alias::Name/path`, relative paths, and the durable
`id::<volume-id>/path` form (`Root::VolumeId`, a typed 16-byte identity
parsed only from the canonical hyphenated lowercase UUID spelling — resolved
by the kernel volume forest, `plans/DEVICES.md` D3a). The remaining
administrative resolver spellings (`fs::`, `<driver>::`, `dev::`, `net::`,
`view::`) are *declined* today (`PathError::UnsupportedResolver`), and a bare
`Name:selector` is declined (`PathError::NotAPath`), because they have no
consumer yet.

**Resolver-stage work (remaining).** As recovery/diagnostic tooling lands,
`lib/path` gains the `fs::` / `<driver>::` / `dev::` / `net::` / `view::`
`Root` variants **in place** (`AGENTS.md` §2.13 — no `v2`, no second parser);
each variant is added by the stage that introduces its caller, not
speculatively (§2.3 / §2.4).

## 13. Boot, discovery, and publishing lifecycle

1. Architecture-specific discovery builds the hardware tree (`AGENTS.md` §18).
2. The bootstrap floor brings up the minimal bus/storage path to reach the
   signed driver store (`AGENTS.md` §18.6).
3. The partition layer (`lib/partition`) discovers storage-object boundaries.
4. Filesystem probes identify candidate volume roots.
5. The volume manager publishes an `id::` root for every valid discovered root.
6. The namespace manager loads signed alias policy, if present.
7. The namespace manager publishes the machine aliases.
8. The session manager adds user/session aliases after login.
9. The synthetic `/` view is assembled from the alias namespace.

**Hotplug.** Insertion publishes an `id::` root (and, if policy permits, a safe
alias); removal fails existing handles per their object semantics, marks the
alias unavailable/removed per policy, logs the event, and invalidates **no**
unrelated root or alias.

## 14. Security and capability model

Resolving a path is at least two capability-checked phases: (1) resolve the root
selector (alias/ID/driver root/network export/device); (2) walk the inner path
and open/operate on the object. Both phases check authority before touching
protected state (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). `uid = 0` is never an authority shortcut.

Capability policy reuses the existing `CAP_FS_MOUNT` / `CAP_FS_MOUNT_RELAX`
where they already fit. Finer authorities (attaching a driver, publishing a
root, administering persistent aliases, altering view projections, opening a
raw device, recovery-only operations, privileged storage inventory) are
introduced **only with the service that holds and enforces them** — never ahead
of a live holder and enforcement point (`AGENTS.md` §5.2). This spec does not
mint speculative `CAP_*`; each such capability lands in the stage that
implements its subsystem.

**File picker / app sandboxing.** An app must not gain broad alias access from
a mere path string. A GUI picker or shell hands the app a one-shot file/directory
capability (a delegated handle), not ambient access to the alias. Path strings
are for display, logs, recent-file lists, and explicit shell operations — never
capability tokens.

## 15. Permissions, flags, ACLs, and MAC

Every open/read/write/mutate still enforces inode owner/mode/ACL, the optional
per-inode capability requirement (`AGENTS.md` §5.3), MAC policy, and the mount
flags. The flags `ro`, `nosuid`, `nodev`, `noexec` attach to **root
publications and view bindings**, not only to Unix-style mountpoints. A view
binding may only preserve or restrict them; relaxing a flag from the source
root requires the explicit relax capability and is audited (§23 of the brief;
`fs.flags.relax.*`). A filesystem-backed resolver (`adfs::`, `fat32::`,
`arxfs::`) enforces the identical capability/ACL/flag/MAC/audit rules as
`alias::` / `id::` access to the same object — it is never a policy bypass.

## 16. System Information API integration

Privileged storage inventory (the volume forest, root IDs, published aliases,
health) is exposed **only** through typed System Information API queries
(`AGENTS.md` §16.6), each declaring its required capability. There is no
`/proc`/`/sys` device tree and no namespace resolver that scrapes live system
state (§6). This preserves `AGENTS.md` §16.1's ban on fabricating a `/proc`.

## 17. Installer defaults

The installer (`AGENTS.md` §11) creates the required machine aliases
(`System:`, `Users:`, `Apps:`, `Storage:`) and the default `/` view containing
exactly those four projected entries. Expert mode may not introduce a legacy
POSIX top-level name into the default root view (`AGENTS.md` §11, §16.1), and
`/Storage/<name>` entries are always projections of independent aliases, never
canonical mountpoints. Single-volume and multi-volume installs both produce the
same alias-first model; a multi-volume install publishes each volume as its own
`id::` root plus its policy-chosen alias.

## 18. Shell and GUI behaviour

The shell displays and consumes alias paths (`cd`, prompt, word/tilde expansion,
completion) through `lib/path` — never a fixed top-level directory set and never
a second parser. `cd` changes a per-process current root/directory that is a
typed `Root` + components, not a raw string. The file manager shows the alias
forest (`System`, `Home`, `Apps`, `Storage`, plus published volume aliases);
recent-file lists store durable `id::` references so they survive alias
churn.

## 19. Links and cross-root references

Hardlinks are within a single root only. A relative symbolic link resolves
within its containing root and cannot escape it (`..` bounded, §5). An absolute
symlink within the same root resolves against that root. A **cross-root**
symbolic link (target names another alias/ID) is resolved only with authority
over the target root and is subject to the same two-phase capability check
(§14); a cycle across views fails closed (`ViewCycle`).

## 20. Foreign-filesystem behaviour

Reading a foreign volume (ext4, FAT32, ADFS, …) is interoperability with the
outside world, not TAIRiX self-compatibility (`AGENTS.md` §2.13). A foreign
driver declares its feature limits (permissions/ACL support, stable file IDs,
label uniqueness/mutability, and timestamp range/precision/representability,
`AGENTS.md` §21) through the filesystem capability API. A weak foreign
filesystem must not weaken TAIRiX security: if it cannot store TAIRiX ACLs or
capabilities, its root publication applies a policy wrapper and defaults to
restrictive flags. Narrowing a `Time64` to a foreign field is checked and fails
with `TimestampOutOfRange` rather than silently truncating (§22).

**The ownerless-format policy wrapper is landed** (`plans/DEVICES.md` D3d):
a runtime-attached FAT32 volume is mounted under the kernel's storage-group
identity map (`tairix_kernel::volume_policy::GroupMappedFs`) — every node
appears owned by the system user and the well-known `storage` group
(`tairix_users::STORAGE_GROUP`, resolved **by name** from the loaded group
registry at root unlock), directories `rwxrwxr-x` and files `rw-rw-r--`, so
any logged-in member reads and writes the medium while security-record
stores stay refused (the format cannot hold one). A registry without the
group, or a format with a real owner model (ARXFS, ext4), gets no wrapper:
the former stays restrictively system-owned, the latter keeps its on-disk
owners/modes/ACLs.

## 21. ABI and crate ownership

| Home | Owns |
|---|---|
| `lib/path` (`tairix-path`) | The `no_std` path parser and normalizer (§12). |
| `lib/abi` (`fs` / `storage` / `sysinfo` types) | ABI-visible filesystem/path/root/volume-metadata types + the descriptor-producing open-a-path ABI + storage sysinfo queries (§16). All `Time64` where time is stored/reported. |
| `lib/caps` | Capability IDs and checks. |
| `userland/system/devmgr` | Storage-driver autoload integration. |
| `userland/system/installer` | Default alias-policy creation (§17). |
| `userland/shell/elsh` | `Alias:/` consumption and display (§18) — via `lib/path`, no private parser. |

The **descriptor-producing open-a-path ABI** — the syscall that opens a
resolved path to a new file descriptor (consumed by, not invented in,
`tairix_rt::io`) — is landed: `fs_open` and its `fs_close`/`fs_read`/
`fs_write`/`fs_readdir`/`fs_stat`/`fs_truncate`/`fs_sync`/`fs_mkdir`/
`fs_unlink`/`fs_rename` family, all gated by `CAP_FS_ACCESS` and fail-closed,
and the ergonomic I/O layer opens files over the same `Read`/`Write`
vocabulary. Every path-taking call resolves at the single kernel entry point
through `lib/path`, and **machine-alias resolution** is wired there:
`Alias:/path` and the expanded `alias::Name/path` resolve for the four machine
aliases, which are the canonical roots the `/` view projects as `/<Name>`
(`kernel/core::fs::resolve_machine_alias`, derived from the one root template
so the view and the alias namespace cannot drift). **Durable `id::`
resolution is wired at the same entry point** (`plans/DEVICES.md` D3a): the
kernel volume forest (`kernel/core::fs::volumes::VolumeForest`, installed via
`BootInfo::with_volumes`) maps each mounted volume's stable identity — the
ARXFS per-volume UUID, published by the boot mount/unlock paths with the
audited `fs.root.publish.{allow,deny}` events — to the `/`-view location its
root backs, so `id::<volume-id>/path` opens the same object under the same
permissions, never a policy bypass, and an unpublished identity fails closed
`NotFound`. **Runtime attach and unpublish are landed** (`plans/DEVICES.md`
D3b): the `CAP_FS_MOUNT`-gated, audited `volume_attach` / `volume_detach`
syscalls attach a filesystem driver to a hot-pluggable block source (the
kernel blkio client over a served block-service endpoint + shared window),
mount its root at `/Storage/<name>` with the removable-media flags, and
publish/withdraw its `id::` root through the same forest — a detach flushes
first and fails closed rather than discarding uncommitted data. **Automount
policy, catalog enumeration, and the mount-policy identity map are landed**
(`plans/DEVICES.md` D3c/D3d): the `volmgr` policy driver probes and attaches
recognised volumes with deterministic names, `/Storage` listings enumerate
the published runtime mounts (§10), and an ownerless foreign format mounts
under the storage-group identity map (§20). Alias policy and the `fs::`
resolver remain future increments; machine aliases then rebind from the
single root's subtrees to independent `id::` volume roots without changing
the resolver contract.

## 22. Error model

Typed, fail-closed errors (no production path panics on malformed input, a
missing alias, an absent device, an I/O error, or an unsupported feature):

```text
UnknownResolver   MalformedPath        InvalidAliasName
AliasNotFound     AliasAmbiguous       AliasUnavailable
RootIdNotFound    RootUnavailable      PermissionDenied
CapabilityRequired ViewUnavailable     ViewCycle
PathEscapesRoot   FilesystemDriverUnavailable
FilesystemFeatureUnsupported           ForeignFilesystemLimit
TimestampOutOfRange DeviceUnavailable  RawDeviceAccessDenied
PolicyWouldRelaxFlags
```

`lib/path`'s parse-time `PathError` (malformed, over-long, escaping, not-a-path,
unsupported-resolver) is the *spelling* subset of this model; the resolve/open
errors above are surfaced by the storage/filesystem subsystems that add the
open-a-path ABI (§21).

A vanished device answers the *device* error, never the *feature* one, on
**every** operation. `FilesystemFeatureUnsupported` is a permanent claim about
the format ("this volume has no symbolic links"); `DeviceUnavailable` is a
condition a re-insert can clear, and a caller must be able to tell them apart.
So the stand-in a removal installs under the volume's handle writes out every
method of every facet it claims — including the ones the driver ABI defaults —
because inheriting a default would answer the wrong one of these two.

## 23. Audit events

Security-relevant namespace decisions are logged through `lib/log` with stable
event IDs (`AGENTS.md` §5.4, §19.4): `fs.root.{discovered,attached}`,
`fs.root.publish.{allow,deny}`, `fs.alias.create.{allow,deny}`,
`fs.alias.remove.{allow,deny}`, `fs.alias.resolve.deny`,
`fs.view.bind.{allow,deny}`, `fs.flags.relax.{allow,deny}`,
`fs.raw_device.open.{allow,deny}`, `fs.hotplug.root_{added,removed}`,
`fs.hotplug.surprise_removal.{clean,dirty,lost}` (a vanished device with
nothing uncommitted / with its uncommitted writes retained / after retention
was abandoned), `fs.hotplug.force_unmount` (a volume force-unmounted, its
retained uncommitted writes deliberately discarded — the event carries the
discarded byte count and the reason a clean commit was impossible),
`fs.hotplug.reinsert_replayed` (a re-inserted volume proven unmutated, its
retained writes replayed and committed — carries the replayed byte count),
`fs.hotplug.reinsert_conflict` (a re-inserted volume whose non-mutation could
not be proven, mounted fresh and read-only with the retained set kept —
carries the refusing cause and the retained byte count), and
`fs.conflict.alias_ambiguous`. No secret, key,
capability-token value, or private path content beyond the audit subsystem's
policy set is logged.

## 24. Required tests

- **Parser** (landed in `lib/path`, incl. the `fuzz_path` round-trip harness):
  `Home:/…` and `alias::Home/…` parse to the same root+components; `id::<uuid>/…`
  and `adfs::HardDisc4/…` are handled per §12; `Home:Documents/…`, `C:foo`, and
  NUL-bearing paths are rejected; `Home:/../../System` cannot escape the root.
- **Namespace** (resolver stage): alias lookup needs authority; missing/ambiguous
  aliases fail closed; session overrides do not mutate the machine table; a
  sandboxed process sees only delegated aliases; a multi-target alias write
  needs an explicit target.
- **Fault tolerance** (resolver stage): a volume opens by `id::` with the `/`
  view or `Storage:` unavailable; corruption of `System:` does not hide a
  healthy `Backup:` from an authorized recovery environment.
- **Security** (resolver stage): publish/alias/view mutation require capability;
  a view binding cannot relax flags without the relax capability; driver-backed
  resolvers do not bypass ACLs/caps/flags; raw `dev::` is denied without
  authority; inventory is not reachable via `/proc`/`/sys`.
- **Installer / hotplug** (resolver + installer stages): default install creates
  the aliases and exactly the four view entries; expert mode refuses legacy
  names; insertion publishes an `id::` root; removal invalidates only that root.

## 25. Rejected designs

Option A (keep §16 literally, aliases layered on top) is rejected: it preserves
the Unix single-root failure model. The forbidden outcomes of `AGENTS.md` and
the brief are binding here: storage identity dependent on one `/` tree; volumes
canonical only as `/Storage/<volume>`; `/mnt` / `/media` under another name;
drive letters or `D:relative` semantics; filesystem type as durable identity;
