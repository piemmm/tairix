# Desktop theming

`lib/theme` (`tairix-theme`) is the single shared theme definition for the
TAIRiX desktop (`AGENTS.md` §6, §10). One theme drives the colours, corner
radii, fonts, and cursors of the window manager, the taskbar, and the default
apps, with a default dark theme and a light theme switchable at runtime.
"Adding a theme is data, not new code" (`AGENTS.md` §10).

## Why a `lib/` crate

Sibling userland crates may not depend on one another (`AGENTS.md` §17.4), so
the one definition the GUI crates and apps all read lives in `lib/*` — the
same reasoning that puts the System Information client helpers in
`lib/procinfo`. The crate has no dependencies and sits at the bottom of the
§17.4 layering: it is depended on, never depends.

## A theme is data

The crate owns no rendering arithmetic; it is a table of values. A `Theme`
bundles, under a stable `ThemeId`:

- `Palette` — semantic `Rgba` colour roles plus the two floating-chrome
  opacities: the surface/foreground base
  (`desktop`, `surface`, `surface_raised`, `document`, `title_band`,
  `on_surface`, `on_surface_muted`,
  `accent`, `on_accent`, `selection_fill`, `border`), the Reactive Alloy
  control roles
  (`surface_hover`, `surface_pressed`, `rim`, `rim_active`, `danger`), the
  signal roles the boards' legend fixes (the `*_pressure` set,
  `network_activity`, `recovery`, `success`, `warning`, `denied`,
  `workload`, and the four transfer directions `disk_read`, `disk_write`,
  `net_receive`, `net_send`), the
  scroll and window-frame roles
  (`scroll_track`, `scroll_thumb`, `frame`), the window-command highlight
  roles (`window_close`, `window_minimize`, `window_maximize`,
  `window_put_to_back`), and `title_hue_alpha`. The
  roles are named fields, not a free-form map, so a theme can never omit a
  role and a consumer can never request one that does not exist.
  `Palette::signal(SignalRole)` is the one place a
  signal becomes a colour. The window manager, the taskbar, and the apps all
  read these same roles, which is what makes a theme switch apply
  consistently everywhere.
  - Not every signal is a resource pressure. `workload` is what the machine is
    *running* — a task census — which drawn in the compute hue reads as a
    second CPU trace beside the real one; and a *direction* of transfer is a
    signal in its own right, so `disk_read`/`disk_write` and
    `net_receive`/`net_send` let a duplex instrument say which way the bytes
    went instead of drawing both halves in one hue. The two greens
    (`workload`, `disk_read`) are one step apart and never share an
    instrument; the network pair stays in the blue/violet family so a network
    reading still reads as network while its directions separate.
  - `surface_hover` and `surface_pressed` are the pointer plates, and they are
    what makes a **bar-seated** control legible: an icon in the taskbar wears
    no perimeter of its own, so its plate is the only thing that can report
    hover or press. The hover role therefore steps *away* from
    `surface_raised` (the bar fill) in the direction its appearance calls for —
    brighter on dark, deeper on light — and the tests assert that separation on
    both appearances rather than trusting the authored numbers. The asserted
    floor is what "one clear step" means to a user, not the smallest difference
    a screen can resolve: this is also the wash a menu row and a list row are
    highlighted with, so a hover authored a few luma off its ground reads as no
    highlight at all, everywhere at once. The tests additionally hold body text
    legible *on* both plates, so the wash can never be strengthened into the
    foreground it carries.
  - `document` is the ground a document's own *content* is drawn on: an
    editor's or a terminal's page, an editable field's plate. Its own role
    rather than `surface`, because a window and the page inside it are two
    things — the window ground is chrome the eye reads past, while the page is
    what the user is looking at. It therefore goes the *other* way from the
    chrome around it: white on a light appearance, the deepest layer on a dark
    one. A field that only shows a value stays on the plate ladder; a field
    the user may type in takes this, so the ground is the affordance.
  - `title_band` is the ground every title band is drawn on: a window's
    furniture bar, and the band a menu or dialog plate is capped with. One
    role for both, because a heading band *is* the title bar with no commands
    in it. It separates from `surface` in the direction the appearance calls
    for — deeper on light so a window's furniture reads as chrome rather than
    as more page, lifted on dark — and the tests assert it is tellable from
    both the window ground it borders and the plate it caps, with the title
    legible on it whether the window is active or not.
  - `surface_selected` is the band filling the row a command surface will act
    on — a menu's current row, wherever the pointer or the keyboard put it. It
    is deliberately *not* `surface_hover`: in a menu there is no separate
    selected state to hover towards, so the current row **is** the choice and
    has to read like one, which makes it a decisive band rather than a wash.
    It is also laid **solid** rather than through `ground_fill`, because it is
    a mark: a highlight diluted by the wallpaper leaves the row that acts no
    heavier than the rest of a floating plate. The tests hold it a stated
    distance from both the plate and the hover wash, in the appearance's own
    direction, and hold body text legible on it.
  - `selection_fill` is the plate a selected item is filled with — an icon tile
    in the file manager's grid, on the desktop's icon field, or on the login
    chooser. It is each theme's own `accent` at three tenths opacity (alpha
    `77`): `#d1550f4d` on dark, `#c8500c4d` on light. It is this light because
    it is not doing the work alone — the backdrop beneath a selected item is
    frosted by `selection_backdrop_blur` first, and that separation is what
    marks the item, leaving the accent to tint rather than to cover. What lies
    behind the item — a window's surface, the wallpaper — still reads through
    the selection instead of being replaced by a block of accent. It is
    authored per theme rather than derived from `accent` at the draw site, so
    a theme can tune the fill's weight against its own surfaces.
  - `chrome_alpha` (`204`, four fifths) and `chrome_plate_alpha` (`229`) are
    opacities, not colours, and they are what a *floating* desktop-chrome
    surface is drawn at: the taskbar and every popup it opens — the
    program-library launcher, the notification popover, the Switchboard
    capsule's readout — and every menu plate the desktop puts on screen.
    `chrome_plate_alpha` is *derived* from `chrome_alpha`, half of what is left
    between it and solid, so raising the chrome opacity cannot narrow the step
    a raised plate reads by. Such a surface keeps whichever colour role it
    wears when solid and takes `chrome_alpha`, so a frosted bar is recognisably
    the same grey a solid one was, what is behind it — the wallpaper, an open
    window — reads through instead of being replaced by a band across the
    screen, and every relationship the theme authored survives. Anything that
    reads as *part* of the surface — a list row, a menu row, a scrollbar
    channel, and the surface's own `rim`, which is its edge rather than a mark
    on it — takes the same alpha, which is what keeps a resting row exactly its
    ground rather than a patch on it; a control *plate* raised on it — a button,
    a text field, a notification card — takes `chrome_plate_alpha`, a step more
    solid, so it reads as furniture standing on the glass rather than a hole cut
    in it. `255` draws chrome solid. Like `selection_fill` neither works alone:
    the backdrop is blurred by `chrome_backdrop_blur` first, which is what lets
    opaque icons and text sit legibly on a translucent ground. Exactly one such
    fill is laid down per surface — a second translucent layer over the first
    would compound into an opacity no theme authored, so a floating panel drops
    its header band and states the header with its rail and title instead.
  - `frame` is a single *neutral* tone — a step lighter than `surface` on dark,
    a step deeper on light — and it is deliberately **not** a focus signal.
    Every window wears the same quiet rim at every activation, because the rim
    is the line the eye reads a window's shape by: brightening it on focus made
    the boundary the loudest mark on the desktop and left every other window
    looking switched off. Focus is carried by the title bar, whose text sits at
    `on_surface` while active and `on_surface_muted` while not, and under heavy
    contrast the active frame adds a second inner rim line
    (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §15) so the distinction is a difference in
    shape as well as tone.
  - `window_close`, `window_minimize`, `window_maximize`, and
    `window_put_to_back` are the four hues a title-bar command lights up in
    under the pointer: red to close, yellow to minimize, green to the size
    toggle (maximizing and restoring alike — one command, one identity), blue
    to put-to-back. Each is authored at half opacity (`128`), so the wash tints
    the title bar rather than covering it and a lit command still reads as part
    of the window. They are four separate roles rather than a reuse of
    `danger` / `warning` / `success`: retuning a signal hue for legibility must
    not silently repaint a window button, and a command's hue is its identity,
    not a statement about severity. A command wears nothing at rest, so the
    colour *is* the highlight; keyboard focus still states itself on the ring
    inside the plate, because the wash belongs to the pointer. Because a
    control plate is laid down rather than composited, the renderer resolves
    the authored translucency against the window body first
    (`Rgba::over`) — laying the raw value down would cut a hole through the
    window's furniture strip instead of tinting it.
  - `title_hue_alpha` (`82`, a little under a third) is an opacity, not a
    colour, and the colour it governs is not the theme's at all: a title bar
    washes its band with the **dominant hue of its window's identity icon**, so
    a glance at a bar says which application owns the window before its title is
    read. The theme sets only how far through that hue reads, and
    `Metrics::title_hue_reach` (`500` logical pixels) how far it travels from
    the icon before it is gone. `0` turns the wash off for a theme that wants
    plain chrome. See [the window manager](./wm.md) for how the wash is drawn.
- `Metrics` — every logical length the desktop is laid out from, so no
  renderer carries a private constant: the corner radii and
  `border_thickness`; the scrollbar's `scrollbar_breadth` and
  `min_thumb_length`; the control anatomy (`control_height`,
  `control_inset`, `control_gap`, `control_corner_radius`,
  `selection_backdrop_blur`, `seam_thickness`,
  `rail_thickness`, `bead_size`, `measured_thickness`, `progress_thickness`,
  `composition_thickness`, `chart_height`, `selector_extent`,
  `toggle_track_length`, `sidebar_icon_extent`); the desktop's
  floating chrome (`taskbar_margin`, `chrome_backdrop_blur`); and the window
  furniture
  (`title_bar_height`, `frame_inset`, `title_hue_reach`,
  `resize_grabber_extent`, `resize_edge_grab`, `resize_corner_grab`,
  `hit_slop`).
  - `control_inset` is the room a control plate keeps for a **line of type**,
    `10` logical pixels in both themes: the label's horizontal budget is the
    plate less the frame border and this inset either side, so text stays clear
    of the rounded corners. It is *not* a vertical budget — it exceeds what the
    theme's own `control_height` can spare around an 18px glyph — and charging
    it vertically withheld a plate's whole content rather than clipping it, so
    every button laid out on a text row pitch drew as an empty plate (the
    Properties and "Open With…" windows). The vertical budget is the plate less
    the frame it must not overlap; the content is centred in it and the surface
    clips, which is what every other blit in the crate does. It was also
    sizing the glyph of an *icon-and-label* plate: on the 28px control plate
    that left a 6px glyph beside 18px type — the same "tiny icon" defect
    `icon_content_side` had already fixed for icon-*only* plates, still present
    in this arm. The glyph is now the height of the type beside it.
  - `taskbar_margin` is how far the taskbar stands off the screen edges it
    faces, `5` logical pixels in both themes. The bar floats: the margin
    applies to the three sides facing a screen edge — for a bottom bar the
    left, right, and bottom — so the wallpaper is unbroken around it and its
    rounded corners all read. The fourth side faces the work area, which the
    margin never widens: the band a maximized window is kept out of runs from
    the screen edge to the bar's inner side, so the gap behind the bar is not
    handed to a window either.
  - `chrome_backdrop_blur` is how far the backdrop behind a floating chrome
    surface is blurred, `7` logical pixels in both themes — wide enough that
    the wallpaper reading through the chrome is a wash of its colours rather
    than detail competing with the icons on top, narrow enough that the
    larger shapes behind the bar still place it on the desktop. It is the
    same compositor filter `selection_backdrop_blur` uses, asked for by the
    session as each chrome surface is placed.
  - `selection_backdrop_blur` is how far the *backdrop* behind a selected item
    is blurred, `6` logical pixels in both themes. The `selection_fill` laid
    over it keeps a crisp, rounded edge; it is the pixels the item covers — a
    window's surface, the wallpaper — that are frosted, so a selected item
    reads as frosted glass rather than as a softened smear. It is deliberately
    a *short* length. A box blur of radius `r` averages `2r + 1` samples, so a
    radius approaching the size of the item averages its whole backdrop to one
    colour: the mark then reads as a smudge with an accent cast, and the
    wallpaper behind it is simply gone. This one is wide enough to destroy the
    fine detail that would otherwise show through the fill and narrow enough
    that the larger shapes behind the mark still read, and `tairix-controls`
    brackets it from both sides in rendering tests rather than pinning the
    number. The blur radius scales through `Scale` like every other length
    here, and the frosting runs through the one shared region frost the
    compositor uses rather than a second implementation.
  - `chart_height` is the one measured instrument that is a *box* rather than
    a line: a history plot needs vertical room to rise and fall in, so it is
    several times `progress_thickness`. A trend confined to a track's
    thickness cannot rise more than a pixel or two whatever it reads.
  - `measured_thickness` is the breadth of a slider's groove and
    `progress_thickness` that of a progress trace's bar. Both are deliberately
    thin instrument lines rather than `control_height` plates, centred in the
    row the owner lays them out in, which is how the boards draw them. The
    trace is the broader of the two: a slider's thumb marks its value, while a
    read-only fill has to stay legible across a long run on its own.
  - `composition_thickness` is broader still, because a composition band is
    *categorical*: the eye has to match each coloured run to a name in the key
    beneath it, and a run a few pixels tall is a colour a reader cannot
    identify. It stays under `control_height`, so the band still reads as an
    instrument rather than a plate.
  - `selector_extent` (a checkbox box, a radio circle, a toggle track's
    breadth) and `toggle_track_length` size a boolean selector's *mark*
    smaller than the row that carries it, so the glyph stays compact while the
    full row remains the hit target.
  - `sidebar_icon_extent` is the other way about: a sidebar entry's leading
    icon is taller than the line of text beside it, because a sidebar is found
    by its icons before its labels are read, and the entry grows to seat it.
    Like the selector extents it is what a control *is*, so density leaves it
    alone and moves only the clearance around it.
- `Fonts` — one `FontSpec` (family, size, weight) per `TextRole`, derived from
  a single authored base size through the boards' shared ladder (see
  [Typography](#typography)), referencing faces under `/System/Fonts`.
- `CursorSet` — one asset id per `CursorKind`, referencing assets under
  `/System/Graphics`.
- `Timeline` — one animation in flight, and the single definition of how a
  duration becomes frames. A surface starts one from the theme's duration for
  the interaction it is beginning, asks how far through it is when it paints
  (`progress` for a strength fade, `eased` for anything that travels), and asks
  when to wake next (`next_frame_in`, the nearer of what remains and one frame
  at 60 Hz). It reads no clock: the embedder passes the monotonic instant it
  already holds, which is what lets a surface animate on the host with no
  kernel. Running and settled are the whole of the model: a zero duration
  starts *settled* — complete, with no wake asked for — so reduced motion needs
  no second code path and an idle surface arms no timer at all, while a
  *running* timeline always owes at least one more frame. Once its span has run
  out (or the clock has jumped behind its start) that frame is due **now**,
  because it is the end state and nothing has drawn it yet; presenting takes
  real time, so a span routinely ends between a surface's step and the moment
  it works out its park. The owner draws that frame and then settles or drops
  the timeline — that, not the clock, is what ends the sequence.
- `Fade` — one strength ramp in flight: a `Timeline` carrying a value from
  where it started to where it is going. A timeline answers *how far
  through*, a fade answers *what the strength is*, and every surface that
  dissolves between two strengths is this one state machine — the login
  screen's veil covering the screen and lifting off it again, a session's
  screen revealing from black and going back to it. The direction is nothing
  more than the two ends: a ramp to `u8::MAX` covers, one to `0` uncovers,
  and one begun part-way simply names the strength it starts from. That last
  is what lets a fade interrupt another honestly — a log-out chosen while the
  desktop is still revealing dims from where it had got to instead of
  flashing bright first. The interpolation is linear, like every fade's,
  because the strength is what the eye reads rather than the travel.
- `MotionTheme` — one duration per `MotionInteraction`, in milliseconds, so no
  control carries a private animation timing. It is a table indexed by the
  interaction rather than a field per interaction: the durations are all the
  same type, so positional arguments could be transposed silently and a new
  interaction would change every call site's arity.
  - `SelectionChange` (`100` ms in both themes) is the cross-fade as a
    selection mark moves between items — the login chooser's account tiles,
    the file manager's grid, the desktop's icon field. The item being left
    decays while the item arrived at grows, so nothing jumps.
  - `StageTransition` (`240` ms) is one whole view giving way to another: the
    login screen stepping between the account chooser and the chosen account's
    secret prompt, in either direction.
  - `AttemptRejected` (`420` ms) is the thing an authority refused, shaken to
    say so — the login screen's prompt when a secret is not accepted.
  - `SessionFade` (`1000` ms) is a whole session's screen appearing or
    leaving, in either direction: the login screen appearing out of black and
    fading back to it once a secret is accepted, and the desktop revealing
    from that black and dissolving back into it when the session ends. One
    span for all four, so the two halves of a hand-over meet on the same
    colour at the same rate.
  - `BackdropChange` (`600` ms) is the desktop's backdrop giving way to
    another: the wallpaper arriving over the plain backdrop colour once it has
    been read and fitted, and one wallpaper dissolving into the next when the
    choice changes. Longer than a control's own motion because it is the whole
    screen changing under everything else.
  - A theme in reduced motion reports **every** duration as `0`, which a
    consumer reads as "change it now". That is the whole reduced-motion path:
    the state still changes visibly, through contrast and shape, and no
    control carries a second branch for it. A zero duration also means no
    animation frame is ever asked for, so an idle surface arms no timer.

A theme also carries the **ground** its surfaces are drawn on. `SurfaceGround`
is `Opaque` by default, `Floating` on the copy `Theme::floating` returns — the
theme the taskbar draws its bar and its popups with — and `Frosted` on the copy
`Theme::frosted` returns, the theme an application window cut from the same
glass draws with (the Switchboard, Settings): its own ground takes
`chrome_alpha`, and everything laid on it, rows included, stays solid. `Theme::ground` reports it and
`Theme::backdrop_blur` states the blur that ground reads over — `0` when opaque,
`chrome_backdrop_blur` on either glass — so the fills and the blur cannot
disagree. `ThemeRegistry::active_on` holds each grounded form beside the active
theme and drops them with it, so no surface lags a theme switch. The ground
rides on the theme rather than on each control, so everything drawn with one
theme agrees and no control can be forgotten and left an opaque patch;
`lib/controls` is where a background becomes the chrome alpha for its layer. See
[the control library](../lib/controls.md#surface-ground-opaque-floating-chrome-or-a-frosted-window).

`Theme::dark` is the default; `Theme::light` is its light counterpart. Both are
the Reactive Alloy design boards (`plans/desktop1.png`, `plans/desktop2a.png`,
`plans/desktop1-light.png`) read off rather than invented: near-black cool
surfaces (dark) or one descending ladder of **neutral greys** (light) under one
alloy-orange accent family, with the semantic signal hues the boards' own
legend fixes.

The light theme's neutrals are neutral by test — `r == g == b` on every one of
them — so the only colour on a light desktop is a signal hue. Its window
ground is a mid-light grey (a 15% grey) rather than paper, and its title bands
a 25% grey: white window grounds left every application reading as a blank
sheet, with nothing for a plate to be raised off and nowhere for a title band
to sit. Paper is `document`'s alone, so the surfaces a user *writes* on are the
white ones. Raised chrome — plates, menus, the taskbar — catches the light
*above* the window ground, and the interaction ladder deepens away from it;
both those two levels and the ladder's direction are asserted rather than
trusted to the authored numbers.

The two appearances re-tune every role for their own background — except
`on_accent`, which is deliberately the *same* warm white in both: a primary
action is one treatment in the boards (a warm white label on the alloy-orange
plate), so the token is shared rather than restated (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The
invariant that matters for it is therefore legibility, not difference, and the
tests assert a minimum luma separation from the accent fill.

## Typography

A theme sizes text by the **job** it does, never by the widget that draws it.
`TextRole` is a closed set — `Display`, `Heading`, `ItemTitle`, `WindowTitle`,
`Body`, `Metric`, `Caption`, `SectionHeader`, `Monospace` — and
`Fonts::spec(role)` is a constant-time array read, so a text draw can neither
miss a lookup nor invent a size literal at the call site.

Every role's size is a percentage of one authored base (body) size, measured
from the design boards, so a theme states *one* number and the whole desktop's
type scales together (`AGENTS.md` §2.2):

| Role | Size | Named weight | Set in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Display` | 250% | Regular | 480 |
| `Heading` | 133% | Medium | 580 |
| `ItemTitle` | 113% | Medium | 580 |
| `WindowTitle` | 100% | Medium | 580 |
| `Body` | 100% | Regular | 480 |
| `Metric` | 100% | Bold | 780 |
| `Caption` | 87% | Regular | 480 |
| `SectionHeader` | 100% | Bold | 780 |
| `Monospace` | 100% | Regular | 480 |

The boards carry their hierarchy with a deliberately *tight* size ladder and a
rising weight — a detail line sits within a point of the title above it, and a
column header is the size of the rows it heads but bold — so weight, not size,
does most of the work.

Every role is set `TEXT_WEIGHT_LIFT` (80) heavier than its named weight along
the face's own `wght` axis (`lifted`). The UI face's named weights are drawn
light for interface text on a screen and read thin beside the fuller text
other desktops set; one step for every rung gets that fullness from the type
designer's own letterforms, thickens every weight by about the same number of
pixels, and leaves the ladder's hierarchy exactly as the boards set it.
`Display` is the one deliberate exception: it is the rung for a *single*
dominant line on a full screen of its own — the login and lock screens' clock —
and is light rather than heavy, because at that size weight would shout. It has
no place in a window's chrome. Its 250% is the largest multiple that still
rasterises at the maximum authored base under a doubled density; a taller rung
would silently clamp.

The built-ins author the base at 18 logical pixels; `Fonts::ladder` clamps an
authored base into `MIN_BASE_SIZE_PX..=MAX_BASE_SIZE_PX`, so a theme can
neither author text below the rasteriser's legibility floor nor above its
cell-height ceiling (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

Sizes are *logical* pixels at `tairix_geometry::REFERENCE_DPI`;
`tairix_font::BitmapFont::for_role(fonts, role, scale)` is the one place a role
and the active `Scale` become a rasterised face, so the logical→physical
arithmetic is never duplicated (`AGENTS.md` §10, §2.2).

The shared controls (`lib/controls`) and the shared directory-browser engine
(`lib/browse`) call it *themselves*: neither accepts a face from the
application drawing it, so a control's typography cannot be overridden at a
call site. See
[the control library](../lib/controls.md#the-theme-chooses-the-face-not-the-caller). The weight a role names
is the font service's own `FontWeight`, re-exported rather than restated. The
UI face is variable, so `fontd` instances it at exactly that weight — the
glyph and its advance are the ones the designer drew; a face with no `wght`
axis (the fixed-width faces) is thickened instead by the service's bounded
synthetic stroke, which leaves its advance alone.

## No duplicated colour algebra

A theme `Rgba` is a straight-alpha colour token with no compositing
arithmetic. The premultiplied-alpha blending lives in the shared rasteriser
`lib/raster` (re-exported by the window manager and used by the taskbar). The
two meet at exactly one edge — `lib/raster`'s `From<Rgba> for Color`
conversion — so the colour algebra is never copied into the theme crate, nor
re-implemented per consumer (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). Likewise a window or the
taskbar derives its corner style from a theme radius through the compositor's
single rounded-corner path with `Corners::from_radius` (radius `0` is the
square opt-out), never a second rounding implementation.

## Switching at runtime

`ThemeRegistry` owns the available themes and the active selection.
`ThemeRegistry::with_builtins` always holds the dark and light themes (so
there is always an active theme), `set_active` switches the active theme by
id, and `register` adds a custom theme. Both mutators fail closed
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §2.9): `set_active` on an unknown id and `register` of a
duplicate id each return a `ThemeError` and leave the registry unchanged.
Because the built-ins are held in a fixed-size array, `active` always returns
a theme without an `unwrap` or an out-of-bounds index.

### The accessibility axes

Contrast, density and motion belong to the *desktop*, not to a theme: a user
who turns contrast up has not chosen a different palette, and their choice
must survive switching between light and dark and must reach a custom theme
too. `ThemeRegistry::set_accessibility(Accessibility)` lays them over
whichever theme is active and `accessibility()` reads them back.

`active()` therefore answers the theme **as it is drawn** — the selected one
with the axes applied — because every consumer wants the theme that is on
screen and none of them should have to remember to apply the axes itself.
`selected()` answers the theme as it was *registered*, with no axes, which is
what a surface editing them reads so it shows what the theme declares rather
than what the current axes already did to it. The drawn theme is derived once
whenever the selection or the axes move, never per call: `active` is read on
every paint and every hit test, and re-deriving a metric table there would
put the axis arithmetic on the hot path.

`Theme::with_axes` is the one place an axis reaches the pixels. Contrast and
the motion policy are carried as they are; **density** is applied by deriving
the theme's own metric table at that density (`Metrics::at_density`) rather
than swapping in a second table. Density moves exactly the three lengths that
decide how much room a control is given — `control_height` (which is also the
minimum interactive target), `control_inset` and `control_gap` — one step
either side of normal. Nothing else moves, and that is the point: corner
radii, border and instrument thicknesses, selector and bead extents, and the
window furniture are what a control *is*, not how much room it is given.
Scaling them would make a compact desktop draw different-looking controls
rather than closer-packed ones, and would change the meaning of a state,
which density must never do.

### The light/dark control

A "switch to light/dark" desktop control toggles the `Appearance` axis, not a
specific id. `ThemeRegistry::set_appearance(Appearance)` makes the built-in of
the requested appearance active, and `toggle_appearance` flips to the opposite
built-in based on the *active* theme's `Appearance` (a custom dark theme
toggles to the light built-in, and vice versa). Both return the now-active
`ThemeId`. Unlike `set_active` they cannot fail: the two built-ins are always
present, so there is no unknown-id path to surface. The interactive home of
this control is the **Light / Dark Appearance** pair in the Switchboard
capsule's quick-actions menu (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T13): the taskbar reports
the chosen appearance as a typed response and the session glue
(`userland/gui/session`, `tairix-desktop-session`) adopts it as a change to the
desktop's settings document, through the same persist-then-adopt path the
Settings Appearance pane takes — the choice is written first, then put into
effect by `adopt_appearance`, which re-themes the taskbar in place and hands
the compositor the whole theme (full-screen damage, so the next present
repaints every pixel in the new look). The active appearance is the
group's chosen member in the menu — a bullet, disabled — so the
menu can never ask for the appearance already in use. See
[Desktop session glue](./session.md) and [Taskbar](./taskbar.md).

### Open application windows follow the switch

An application's window is the application's own pixels: the session composes
them but cannot re-colour them, so re-theming the desktop alone would leave
every open window sitting in the appearance the user just left. The session
therefore *publishes* the new state. `Appearance`, `Contrast`, `Density` and
`Motion` are all part of the seat's desktop record
(`tairix_abi::desktop::DesktopInfo`), which an app reads before it paints its
first frame and then converges on through the `Desktop` system notice, which
the session publishes whenever any of them changes. They travel together
because they are one decision to a reader and one repaint to an application:
an application that learned only half of what changed would draw the other
half the way the user just stopped asking for. `lib/window`'s
`adopt_desktop` applies all of them in the one call an app already makes, so
each app re-applies the appearance *and* the axes to its own `ThemeRegistry`,
re-resolves whatever it derived from the theme, and presents — so the switch reaches the whole screen
at once, including the apps that have no window open at the time. The enum crossing
that wire *is* `tairix_theme::Appearance`: the theme crate re-exports the ABI's
definition rather than restating it, so the byte on the wire and the value a
theme carries cannot drift apart. See
[Variable DPI and UI scale](./dpi.md) for the rest of that record.

What crosses that wire is the appearance *axis*, not a palette. That is exact
today, because the desktop's own switch chooses between the two built-ins and
nothing registers a third theme at runtime, so naming the axis names the
theme. A desktop that did activate a custom registered palette would leave an
app drawing its own built-in of the same appearance: closing that would mean
either sending the palette itself over the window channel or giving apps a
themes service to read, and neither is worth its cost while the built-in pair
is the whole of what a user can select. Registering a custom theme therefore
means answering that question first, not adding a call.

## Tests

`cargo test -p tairix-theme` covers the built-in palettes (every
appearance-dependent role differs between dark and light, `on_accent` is shared
and stays legible on the accent fill, body and muted text clear their own
minimum contrast, the hover and pressed plates each separate from the bar fill
in their appearance's direction, surfaces are opaque and distinct, the chrome
plate alpha standing a step more solid than the ground alpha with both short of
solid over a blurred backdrop, and a theme drawing opaque until `floating` is
asked for), the type ladder (every role's size and weight, the descending order,
the base-size clamp at both ends, and the monospace role being the only one on
the fixed-width family), the shared metrics/fonts/cursors, cursor lookup for
every kind, and
the registry: the dark default, runtime dark↔light switching, custom-theme
registration and activation, and the fail-closed `UnknownTheme`/`DuplicateId`
paths. The
window manager's `cargo test -p tairix-wm` adds the integration tests that
source the compositor background and a window's corner radius from the active
theme and verify a dark→light switch changes the cleared screen. The
appearance-toggle tests cover `set_appearance` selecting the matching built-in
and `toggle_appearance` flipping between built-ins (including from an active
custom theme).
