# Desktop icons

TAIRiX status and notification icons are **vectorised, scalable, and
themeable** — scalable vector artwork rather than fixed-resolution bitmaps
(`AGENTS.md` §6 / §10, `PLAN.md` Stage 7). They live in the shared `lib/icon`
crate (`tairix-icon`) so the taskbar draws them without the taskbar and the
window manager depending on one another (`AGENTS.md` §17.4). The crate is
`no_std`, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and owns no scan converter or colour
arithmetic of its own — exactly like `lib/cursor`.

## The vector representation

An icon is a `VectorIcon`: filled `IconLayer`s over a square design grid. A
layer is what it is painted with, which points it encloses (its fill rule),
and the contours that bound them — lists of `(x, y)` design-grid coordinates.
It is the shared `lib/raster` artwork layer, so a built-in glyph and one
decoded from SVG are the same thing to the rasteriser. A multi-part glyph — a
battery body plus its terminal, a bell plus its clapper — is built by stacking
layers; a single layer holds several contours because a shape with a hole, and
any stroke outline, are both many rings filled as one through the shared scan
converter. A decoded document may also carry groups, where a clip, a mask, or
a group opacity composites part of the drawing as a unit.

- **Scaling** is exact: `VectorIcon::rasterise(side)` renders the design grid
  across a fresh `side`×`side` `Surface`, transparent everywhere the glyph
  does not draw.
- **Anti-aliasing** and the blend come from one place — `lib/raster`'s
  `Surface::fill_polygon`, the same polygon path the cursor library uses, with
  each pixel taking the true fraction of its own area the artwork covers. The
  icon library hands its layers to that shared path, so the desktop has
  exactly one polygon rasteriser (`AGENTS.md` §2.2 / §10).
- **Layers meet cleanly**: the stack is composed through `Surface::layered`,
  which paints a multi-layer icon larger and averages it down, so a shape's
  stroke over its own fill — and one part of a glyph against the next — shows
  no pale seam. Without it two anti-aliased edges that abut blend as if they
  overlapped and leave the outline short of opaque, which is what reads as a
  soft, washed-out icon.
- **Theming** is a single colour: each built-in glyph is a monochrome
  silhouette tinted by a colour the caller supplies from the active theme, so
  re-theming is data rather than new code.

A zero `side` or an unallocatable buffer fails closed with `None` rather than
panicking (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).

## The glyph set

`IconKind` is the closed set of built-in glyphs: the status kinds (`Network`
— rising signal bars, `Volume`, `Battery`, `Bell`), the file-manager kinds
(`Folder`/`FolderFilled`/`FolderOpen` — an empty folder, one that holds
something, and an open one — `File`, `AppBundle`, the type badges
`Text`/`Image`/`Archive`/`Executable`, the toolbar's `NavBack`/`NavForward`/`NavUp`/
`Refresh`/`ViewToggle`/`Sort`/`NewFolder`, and `Trash`/`EmptyTrash`), the
taskbar's `Library` (the program-library launcher's three-by-three tile
grid, `plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T4) and `User` (a head-and-shoulders bust, the
last-resort mark for the always-trailing account capsule — an account with a
name draws its circular identity disc instead, see below),
the viewer's playback marks `Pause` and `Resume`, the settings categories each sidebar
row of [Settings](settings.md) is found by without reading — `Settings` (a
cog), `Appearance`, `Wallpaper`, `Display`, `LockScreen`, `Screensaver`,
`Power`, `Networking` (a globe, beside the tray's `Network` bars), `Bluetooth`,
`Sound`, `Notifications`, `Keyboard`, `Mouse`, `Trackpad`, `Touchscreen`,
`Printer`, `Accessibility`, `Language`, `Sharing`, `Users` and `Storage` —
and a `Generic` fallback diamond. A category never draws the tray reading or
the single thing it stands beside (`Volume`, `Bell`, `Network`, `User`,
`Disk`): each is drawn as a badge, below.
`IconKind::for_asset` resolves a theme asset identifier to a kind and
falls back to `Generic` for an unrecognised id, so an unexpected notification
still draws a placeholder instead of nothing (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).
`builtin_icon(kind, colour)` turns a kind plus a theme colour into a
`VectorIcon`; `ICON_KINDS` is the closed table a loader iterates.

On-disk icon sets follow the desktop's **SVG-first** asset rule (`AGENTS.md`
§10), the same as cursors: a set under `/System/Graphics` is authored as SVG
and decoded — through the curated §16.4 image-decoding library (`lib/svg`) in
a §19.5 parser sandbox — into the in-memory `VectorIcon` form shown here.
`tairix_icon::decode_svg(bytes)` (built on `tairix_svg::decode` and
`VectorIcon::from_svg`) performs that conversion; a malformed or undecodable
asset fails closed, so the caller substitutes a `builtin_icon` glyph rather
than crashing (`AGENTS.md` §2.9). See [SVG asset decoding](./svg-assets.md).
The built-in glyphs remain the always-present fallback, and are cached like
every other tier: a glyph is retained as an untinted coverage mask keyed
`(kind, side)`, so the shape is resolved once and drawn in whatever colour the
control's state calls for rather than re-rasterised per icon per frame.

## Settings category badges

A settings category's built-in picture is a **badge**: its symbol in white on
a rounded plate of the category's own hue, the way macOS draws its settings
panes. `IconKind::badge()` names the hue from the closed `BadgeHue` set — kin
categories share one (the input devices and the machine's parts stand on grey,
connections and people on blue) — and `builtin_picture(kind, side)` draws it.
The hue is the icon's identity rather than a theme tint, so the same badge
reads on the light and dark desktops, and every ramp is dark enough at its
midpoint that the symbol stands at least 3:1 clear of its plate.

A badge is vector art rasterised at exactly the side its slot asks for: the
plate spans the whole slot, so its flat edges fall on pixel boundaries, and
nothing is ever resampled, so no scale leaves one edge of a stroke solid and
its mirror grey. The symbols are authored as SVG path data on a 24-unit grid
and built through `lib/svg`'s one flattener and stroker, so a symbol and a
decoded SVG asset are the same drawing to the rasteriser. The symbol is also
the category's tintable glyph: `glyph_mask(kind, side)` — what a button or a
menu row draws in its own colour — is the symbol alone, never a tinted plate.

The badge is retained by `ArtworkCache` exactly as a glyph mask is, once per
`(kind, side)`, and handed out as ready-coloured `IconPicture::Artwork`.

An **application bundle's own** icon, which every app must ship
(`plans/APPS.md` §14), is authored as a raster master: a lit, shaded picture of
what the program does, trimmed to fill its square. An SVG bundle icon is still
accepted and decodes through this same path. The complete order a request
resolves through — a thing's own icon,
then its class's raster master, then the class vector asset, then the built-in
picture — is described under [tairix-icon](../lib/icon.md).

## An account's identity disc

An account is drawn as a **circle**, never a class glyph: `monogram_of(name)`
takes its mark and `monogram_disc(mark, side, font, colours)` produces the
picture, at exactly the side the slot asked for so nothing scales or crops it.
One definition serves the login screen's account tiles and prompt
(`lib/greeter`) and the desktop's own account capsule at the trailing end of
the icon bar (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T9), so the mark a person signs in as is
the mark they then live with.

The disc is the tier beneath a picture an account carries of its own. Nothing
sets one yet, so today every account resolves to its monogram; when something
does, it resolves through this same disc and stays circular. Resolution is
total: a name that yields no character still marks the disc with
`FALLBACK_MONOGRAM` (`?`), so an account surface can never be blank
(`AGENTS.md` §2.9), and only where a picture of that side cannot exist at all
does a slot fall through to the `User` glyph.

## In the taskbar

The taskbar's notification area holds an ordered list of status icons, each
naming a theme asset id. When the bar renders, every notification slot resolves
its asset id to an `IconKind`, builds a `VectorIcon` in the theme's
`on_surface_muted` foreground colour, rasterises it to the slot size at the
active scale, and composites it onto the bar through `lib/raster`'s
`Surface::blit`. The glyph is artwork, not a flood fill: the raised bar
background shows through around it. A slot too small to hold a glyph, or an
unrenderable size, paints nothing rather than panicking (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).
