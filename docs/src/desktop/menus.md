# Menus

Every menu on a TAIRiX desktop is the desktop's. There is one chain per seat,
one renderer, and one place a submenu's rules live. An application describes
its menu and receives one answer; it never draws a plate pixel, never learns
where the pointer is inside one, and cannot hold one open.

## What a menu is

A menu is a **chain of session-owned plates**.

- A **plate** is one column of rows under a **title band**: a centred title and
  nothing else — no window commands, no resize edge. The band is the plate's
  drag handle, and it reads as a *heading* over the rows: it shades its own
  strip one step off the plate ground and sets its title **bold**, so a plate
  is a titled block rather than a column of rows with an odd centred one on
  top. The heading rung carries its hierarchy on weight at the *interface
  size* — the same size as the rows it caps — because a band set smaller than
  its own rows reads as a caption instead. The band measures its title box in
  that same bold face: a variable face advances wider at a heavier weight, so a
  box measured in the lighter titling face elides a title the band had room for
  (a plate titled "System" read "Syst…"). A plate is also **at least as wide as
  its own title**, not merely as its widest row — it is chrome the desktop
  sizes to its content, so a title it has the freedom to show is never
  truncated to fit rows that happen to be shorter.
- A **chain** is a root plate and the descendants open beneath it. A child is
  placed edge-adjacent to its parent at its parent row's top, flipped to the
  parent's other side when the screen edge leaves no room, and slid to stay on
  screen.
- A **child** is a **submenu** — more rows from the same model — or one of the
  two surfaces the session draws itself: the **information panel** and the
  **quick-entry field**. All three hang where a submenu's plate would.
- A row that has a child **may still be chooseable**. Clicking it answers its
  id; arriving on it opens its child. Carrying a command and opening a child
  are independent, so one row can offer both the direct action and the longer
  way round to it.
- The chain is the **seat's singleton**. Opening a menu closes whatever was up
  and answers its requester `Dismissed`.

## Titles

A plate's title is derived, never a new field on the wire:

- a submenu's title is its parent row's label;
- the icon-bar menu's root title is the application's title from its **signed**
  manifest (`AppInfoHeader::bundle_title` — the human-readable name, not the
  command word), so a menu cannot be titled as an application it is not;
- a per-window menu's root title is the application's, bounded and sanitised
  exactly as its row labels are.

A plate is **one** ground: the chain lays it once for the band and the rows
together (`paint_titled_surface_plate`), and the rows are painted into it
(`Menu::render_rows`) rather than laying a second plate of their own, which
would rim the plate twice and notch its ground where the rows' own corners
rounded. The band's ground is part of that one plate, in `Palette::title_band`
— the same role a window's furniture bar takes — rounded by the plate's own top
corners, so the band draws only its title. A row's highlight, rail and focus
ring at the plate's first or last row follow the plate's corners too, so
nothing a plate draws reaches past its silhouette: the compositor takes each
surface of the chain as already rounded (`Corners::Painted`) and never cuts its
arc a second time, and every one of them casts a shadow. A menu drawn on its own
still lays its plate and its rows in the one call.

## A plate is floating chrome

A plate is the desktop's own chrome, like the taskbar and the popups it opens,
so it is drawn on the *floating* theme: its `surface_raised` ground takes the
palette's `chrome_alpha` (four fifths) and the compositor frosts what is behind
it by `chrome_backdrop_blur`. Opacity and blur are one decision, not two — blur
behind an opaque surface is per-frame work nothing shows through, and
translucency without it leaves sharp detail competing with the rows on top — so
a plate takes both, from the shared theme values every other floating surface
takes. Rows read as *part* of the plate and take the same alpha, which is what
keeps a resting row exactly its ground.

The floating form is derived **once** per desktop
(`DesktopSession::floating_theme`) and handed to every surface that grounds
itself in it, so a runtime theme switch cannot leave one behind, and a plate's
pixels and the row rectangles it is hit-tested against cannot come from two
themes. Grounding a theme floating flips nothing but the ground, so no
rectangle moves.

The band is `lib/controls`' `TitleBar` seating no commands
(`TitleBarCommands::Empty`), never a second title-bar control. Two properties
follow from that emptiness rather than from knobs of their own: with no command
clusters the drag span is the whole band, and with no leading cluster to
justify against the title centres. The heading treatment follows from the same
emptiness rather than from a field of its own, so a window's bar reading as a
heading — or a plate's band not — is unrepresentable.

## Placement

One rule places every plate and everything that hangs where one would:
`tairix_controls::plate_rect`. It takes the plate's size, an **anchor region**,
a preferred side, a clearance, and the viewport. The plate is bounded to the
viewport, opens on the preferred side, flips to the opposite one when that side
has no room (and the roomier one wins when neither does), then slides along the
cross axis and clamps.

A zero-extent anchor is the point case, so a context menu at a press point and
a slot-anchored icon-bar menu resolve through the same arithmetic. A clearance
of zero is the edge-adjacency a chain needs: travelling from a parent row into
its own child crosses no dead space.

## Opening on arrival, with no timer

A submenu opens when the pointer **arrives on** its parent row — no click, no
hover delay, no timer. Two rules make that deterministic without one:

- a child plate is edge-adjacent to its parent, so there is no gap to cross;
- an open child closes when the pointer **settles on a different row of the
  same parent plate**, never merely because it left the parent row's rectangle.

A disabled row opens nothing and closes nothing.

## Why a row cannot be chosen is a tip, not a caption

A row that cannot be chosen states *why* — but never on the row. The
explanation is the seat's own tooltip
([the controls' tooltip section](./widgets.md)), declared over the row's screen
rectangle as the chain presents and shown after the usual dwell.

It was drawn beside the label once, and that made every plate as wide as its
longest excuse: a file manager's context menu on a directory carried "only a
file opens with an application", so the plate was sized to that sentence
rather than to its commands. The row control therefore has no way to carry
help text at all — `MenuItem` has no reason field and measures none — and the
text lives on `ChainRow::explained`, which nothing draws.

`AppMenuItem::reason` still crosses the wire, unchanged: an application cannot
declare a tooltip region on a plate the desktop owns, so the desktop takes the
declared reason as the tip's content. The chain answers the row under the
pointer through `MenuChain::hovered_tip`, and it answers for the **deepest**
plate only — an ancestor keeps its highlight to show the path travelled, not
to say where the pointer is.

## The information panel

The first child of a chain that is not a plate of rows. It hangs where a submenu's
plate would and lives and dies with the chain: it closes when the pointer
settles on another row of its parent, when the chain dismisses, or when the
chain's owner dies. A press on it is claimed and acts on nothing — it states
facts and offers no command, so its row names no id and choosing it answers
nothing.

It is **session-drawn from the signed manifest**: the application declares only
that the row exists and supplies none of the panel's text, so it cannot state an
identity that is not its own inside desktop chrome. A process with nothing
attesting an identity gets no information row rather than a fabricated panel.

There is deliberately no *application*-drawn child. One was built and deleted
for want of a client: a presentation surface cannot conclude a gesture (below),
and a chain the desktop opened for itself — the icon bar's, the backdrop's — has
no application to ask in the first place.

## The quick-entry field

The second, and the one that takes an answer rather than stating one: a single
line of session-drawn text field under the plate band, pre-filled with text the
declaring row supplied. It is how a menu asks for a short answer — a new name —
without the application drawing anything or seeing a keystroke.

While it is up it **owns the keyboard**. Every key is text, so a name
containing `h` is typed rather than moving a highlight; its own `Escape` closes
the field before the chain's would dismiss the chain; and `Enter` **commits**,
ending the chain and answering with the *field's own id*, which is not the
row's. That distinction is what lets one row mean two things: the file
manager's Rename row opens the in-place editor when clicked and commits a typed
name when its field is used, and the two answers are told apart by id rather
than by the application guessing which the user did.

The committed text does not ride in the answer — an event is one fixed frame
and a name is far wider — so the desktop holds it for the window that owns the
gesture and hands it over once, when that application asks. It is owner-bound,
taken once, and cleared by that window's next menu, so a commit nobody
collected can never answer a later gesture.

Its band titles the surface and does not drag it: a plate is placed by the
user, a child of a row is placed by the chain against the row it hangs off.
And the field **cannot be masked** — the model has no way to say so — so a menu
row is structurally incapable of being a password prompt.

## A row may carry its own icon

A row may name the application bundle its icon comes from, and the desktop
resolves the picture through the one artwork cache every other slot draws
through — the same request a taskbar slot makes, so a candidate row and that
application's slot show the same picture. The artwork layer reads the bundle's
own *signed* manifest and draws only the icon that manifest declares, so a row
naming something that is not a bundle resolves to nothing and falls back to its
built-in glyph. Resolution happens before the paint; the paint itself reads
nothing.

## The grab

While a chain is up the seat's pointer and keyboard route to it:

- the grab starts **at the event that opens the chain** — the press itself for
  the desktop's own menus, the served request for an application's — so an
  event already queued behind it (a busy desktop drains several at once) goes
  to the chain, drawn or not, never to what its plates cover;
- a press **inside** the chain acts there;
- a press **outside** dismisses the chain and is **consumed** — a dismissal
  never doubles as a click on whatever was behind the menu;
- **Escape** closes the deepest open child; with only the root open it
  dismisses the chain, so repeated Escape always gets the user out;
- **traversal** is the service's: Up/Down within a plate, Home/End to its ends,
  Right into the highlighted row's child, Left back out, Enter/Space to
  activate;
- a **mode change** under the gesture — the seat's output resized, the UI scale
  or theme switched — dismisses the chain rather than re-placing it. A plate
  the user has dragged has a position that is theirs, and no rule can carry it
  onto a different screen.

## Dragging

A press on any plate's band moves **that plate and its descendants**; ancestors
stay put. Dragging pins the plate — its placement stops being derived from the
anchor — and its children re-place relative to their parent row as usual.

A dragged chain is still the seat's one chain, still holds the grab, and still
closes on an outside press. Nothing an application sends can pin a menu open;
the only thing that moves a plate is the user's own drag.

## What a repaint costs

A plate is **retained chrome**, not a picture re-rendered per pointer sample.
Each surface of the chain — every plate and the information panel — owns a
compositor window whose pixels persist between presents, and the chain records
what of each still has to be painted: all of it for a surface that is new or
whose rows were rebuilt at a depth another plate held, and otherwise the
rectangles its own controls reported changing.

Moving the highlight therefore costs the row the mark left and the row it
arrived on, in that plate's own pixels, and nothing else: the parent plate, the
open submenu, and the information panel beside it are not touched at all, and a
pointer travelling *within* one row reports nothing and presents nothing.
Dragging a plate costs a move rather than a repaint, since the same pixels are
simply somewhere else. On a frosted, translucent surface that is the whole
difference between re-blending two rows and re-blending all of a plate against
what it stands over, once per sample that crosses a row boundary.

The session paints those rectangles into the buffer the window already holds
(`Compositor::repaint_window`), clipping the surface to each and running the
**one** paint — `MenuChain::render_surface` — under the clip. There is no
second "paint just this row" recipe to disagree with the first: only the writes
are withheld, so a partial repaint lands exactly the pixels a whole one would.
That holds because the paint begins by clearing what it is about to lay: a
plate's ground is translucent and its corners anti-aliased, so an arc pixel's
laid colour mixes with what is under it, and a corner would otherwise keep a
tint of the highlight that last passed over it.

A surface the heap refuses keeps what it owed and is painted on the next pass,
so a refusal can never leave stale pixels reported as current — and a chain the
session cannot give a surface at all is refused `NoResources` rather than left
half on the screen.

## The model, and what an application may say

The service renders one model. The wire model an application sends
(`AppMenu`, `lib/abi/src/window_ipc.rs`) decodes **into** it and is a **bounded
subset** — bounded structurally, not by a check.

The desktop's own rows may state that *the system* lacks the authority for a
command, and draw the Authority Mark that says so. The wire model has no field
for an authority state, so a decoded application row always carries the default
one: an application cannot paint the system's refusal on its own row, because
there is nothing for it to send. Rows an application legitimately marks — a
tick for an independent setting, a bullet for the chosen member of a group —
cross the wire as they always did.

A declared separator becomes the next row's group break rather than a row of
its own, so a separator inside a submenu draws the divider it draws on the root
plate and no index the chain reports names a rule.

A **submenu is a relationship, not a row kind**: any chooseable row that other
rows name as their parent draws the chevron and opens their plate, while still
answering its own id when it is clicked. The separate submenu row kind is what
a parent with no command of its own uses. The shared row control does not
guess at this — it reports every click as an activation, and the model, which
alone knows which rows carry a command, decides whether that is an answer or a
child. The keyboard keeps the two apart by gesture: `Enter` activates, `Right`
walks in.

## What a menu is not

A menu is a column of **commands** the desktop draws in full, and a plate does
not scroll. So a surface over a data set whose size is a property of the
*machine* — everything a user has installed — is not a menu, however menu-like
it looks, because no bound on a plate's rows can promise to hold it.

That bites on the **whole** of such a set, not on a useful part of it. The
file manager's "Open With…" is the worked example: the applications that claim
a file's type are as many as the user installed, so the complete list is a
scrolling chooser in its own window — but the *few* most specific claims fit a
plate easily, so the row carries them as a submenu and its own click opens the
chooser. One row, both answers.

A menu's rows must all exist **before it opens**, because the model crosses the
wire complete in the one request. A submenu therefore cannot be filled in
lazily, and gathering candidates is filesystem work over the program stores.
That does not make the submenu impossible; it decides *where the work goes*.
The file manager keeps that scan warm on the worker it already has, so opening
the menu reads an answer that has already landed and performs no I/O at all.
Before the first scan lands the row simply carries no chevron. What a menu must
never do is make the user wait for a disk to draw a plate.

A **presentation surface still cannot conclude the gesture**. Only a row of the
chain ends a chain, and an application holds no request that dismisses one; a
list drawn inside a child surface would leave the chain standing after the user
had chosen. A submenu is not that surface — its rows are rows of the chain, so
choosing one ends the chain exactly as any other row does.

The scroll alone settles the desktop's own launcher. The program-library popup
is a searchable, scrolled list over as many entries as a user has installed, so
it is not a menu and keeps its own surface. A plate now *does* take text (the
quick-entry field above), but a field is one line the desktop commits, not a
live filter over rows that were fixed when the menu opened — so that is not
what rescues the launcher either. The genuine menu *inside* it — the context
menu on one of its rows — is the desktop's chain like every other
(`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §6, decision 3).

## The desktop's own menus

The desktop's own surfaces are clients of the service exactly as an application
is; the only difference is that their model is built in process rather than
decoded from the wire, and that difference is what lets their rows say things an
application structurally cannot — the Authority Mark that says *the system*
refused a command. Both open through one call (`menu::open_desktop_menu`), which
applies the same seat rule an application's open resolves through, so a menu
never takes the grab from the lock screen or the trusted picker whichever
direction it arrives from.

- **The backdrop menu** — a secondary press on the pinboard hands
  `pinboard::model`'s rows to the chain. See
  [the pinboard](./pinboard.md#the-backdrop-menu).
- **The icon bar's four menus** — an application slot's declared menu, a
  program-library row's context menu, the system quick actions, and the clock. A
  secondary press answers `TaskbarResponse::OpenMenu`, carrying which menu it
  is, its rows, and where the plate hangs; the bar holds no menu state at all,
  because while a chain is up the grab means no event reaches it. See
  [the taskbar](./taskbar.md#the-bars-menus).

Both are answered in process rather than by a `MenuClosed`, and the address an
answer goes to is the chain's owner: `Window` for an application's, `Backdrop`,
or `Bar` carrying which of the bar's menus it was. A chosen row of a bar chain
is read back by the bar itself, over the same table the plate was built from,
into the very typed response a click on the bar produces — so a *Log Out* row
and a *Log Out* click are honoured in one place. The one exception that is not
an exception: a chosen row of an application's **declared** menu is relayed to
that application as `WindowEvent::AppBarMenu { item }`, because the row is the
application's and the desktop never interprets one.

## The applications that are clients

- **The terminal** (`userland/apps/terminal`) — a secondary press on its client
  opens its window menu; `menu.rs` is the row model alone.
- **The file manager** (`userland/apps/files`) — a secondary press on a listing
  opens its context menu, declared by `lib/browse::chrome::context_menu` over
  the same `ContextMenuModel` the trusted picker composes, so the two cannot
  diverge. An inapplicable command is declared *disabled with its reason*
  rather than left out, so the menu's shape does not move with the selection;
  the reason is shown as a tip on dwell, never drawn on the row.
  See [the file manager](./apps.md).
- **The Switchboard** (`userland/gui/switchboard`) — a secondary press on a
  Tasks row, or Enter on the row the keyboard is on, opens that task's menu,
  titled with the task's name and declared by `task_menu.rs`. A command the
  task cannot take is disabled with its reason, which is also how a refusal
  for want of authority is told from one the task's state makes, since only
  the desktop may draw the Authority Mark. The chosen row acts on the task by
  identity and is checked again against the latest sample.
  See [the Switchboard](./switchboard.md#the-tasks-table).
- **TextEdit** (`userland/apps/textedit`) — it has no menu bar: a secondary
  press anywhere in a window opens its one menu, the clipboard rows over
  File, Edit, Find and View as submenus, three plates deep under View's
  choices. It is why a whole menu may hold three plates' worth of rows
  (`APP_MENU_MAX_TOTAL_ROWS`). See [TextEdit](./textedit.md).
- **Paint** (`userland/apps/paint`) — the same shape: a secondary press
  anywhere opens its one menu, the clipboard and selection rows over File,
  Edit, Image, Colours, Sprites, View and Tools as submenus. Its Sprites menu
  carries entry fields — a sprite's new name, the one to go to — answered as
  `MenuOutcome::Entered` and read back with `take_menu_text`. Both editors
  build their menus with `tairix_window::menu::MenuBuilder`.
  See [Paint](./paint.md).

None keeps a menu shell, and none draws a menu pixel.

## Saying that a plate is on screen

Nothing on the window channel says a word about a plate's pixels: an application
learns that its open was *accepted*, never that anything was drawn, and the
desktop's own menus cross no channel at all. So the session announces it —
`MENU_SHOWN`, "menu chain on screen", once per open and only after a frame
carrying the chain reached the display, naming the owner it belongs to: an
application's window, or the desktop itself.

That record is the sibling of the per-window `WINDOW_SHOWN`, and for the same
reason: it is the only honest gate for anything outside the session that needs
to know a menu is visible — a user diagnosing a menu that never appeared, or the
QEMU vertical deciding when a plate is worth photographing and clicking. A chain
the session could not give a surface is refused rather than announced.

## Where it lives

- `userland/gui/session/src/menu.rs` — the chain: the model, the plates, the
  placement, the grab, traversal, dismissal, lifetime, and what of each surface
  is still owed a paint. It touches no compositor; the session presents what it
  lists and takes down what it no longer has.
- `userland/gui/session/src/shell.rs` — `present_menu_chain`, which reconciles
  the compositor against that list and repaints only what is owed.
- `lib/controls` — `ChainModel` (the one model every menu is built as, which
  the wire model decodes into), `Menu` and `MenuItem` for rows, `TitleBar` for
  bands, `plate_rect` and `PlatePlacement` for placement.
- `lib/abi/src/window_ipc.rs` — the wire model, the per-gesture open, and the
  one `MenuClosed` outcome.
- `lib/window` — the engine that keys an open to its attested owner and holds
  one unanswered open per window, so exactly one answer reaches it.

The staged design is `plans/NEW-MENUS.md`.
