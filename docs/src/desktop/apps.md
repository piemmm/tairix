# Default desktop apps

The default graphical applications live under `userland/apps/`. They are
ordinary `.app` bundles (`AGENTS.md` §16.5) that consume the shared desktop
`lib/*` crates — `tairix-geometry`, `tairix-theme`, `tairix-raster`,
`tairix-font` — exactly as the taskbar does, and never depend on the window
manager (`AGENTS.md` §17.4).

## Every app asks the desktop first

An application cannot draw honestly without knowing three things the session
owns: how large the screen is, what UI density the desktop runs at, and
whether the theme is light or dark. Guessing any of them is a defect — a
window that opens larger than the display, a layout at the wrong density, or
a window still dark after the user switched the desktop to light.

So every graphical app starts the same way, before it sizes or paints
anything: `WindowClient::desktop` returns the seat's
`tairix_abi::desktop::DesktopInfo`, and `tairix_window::Desktop` holds it.
From that, uniformly:

- `Desktop::window_size(logical_w, logical_h)` gives the size to open at —
  the app's preferred size, authored in logical pixels as every desktop
  length is, resolved at the live density and capped to the screen. There is
  one such call per app; none computes it itself (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).
- `Desktop::scale()` replaces what used to be a hard-coded 100%, and feeds
  every `BitmapFont::for_role` and every control's layout.
- `Desktop::appearance()` is applied to the app's `ThemeRegistry` *before*
  the first frame, so a window opened into a light desktop opens light.
- `app::adopt_desktop` answers a `Wake::DesktopChanged`: the app holds a
  `Desktop` system notice member (the shared shell arms it), reads the state
  the session published, and adopts it into both its `Desktop` and its theme
  registry. Only a real change costs a re-theme, a re-layout and a repaint; a
  wake carrying nothing new costs none. An app with no window open is told
  too, so its next window opens in the appearance in force.

Both failure paths state their reason and neither invents a value: a refused
query, or a density this client cannot draw at, exits fail-loud with the
app's no-window code (`AGENTS.md` §2.24); a refused *change* is reported on
`stderr` and the app carries on at the last desktop it accepted, rather than
drawing at something it could not validate (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

The query is read-only and carries no capability: it describes the caller's
own seat, names no other principal's data, and grants no authority. See
[Variable DPI and UI scale](./dpi.md) and
[Desktop session glue](./session.md).

## One instance per user, unless the manifest says otherwise

Launching an application that the user already has running does **not** start
a second process: the desktop asks the running one to open. That is what a
user means by clicking a program they already have open, so it is the
*default* — a bundle whose instances are genuinely independent declares
`instances = "multiple"` in its manifest, which the signed
`AppInfoHeader` carries as `APPINFO_FLAG_MULTI_INSTANCE`. The claim is in the
signed manifest rather than on the window channel for the same reason the
icon-bar opt-out is: a running process must not be able to change how many of
itself may exist. Only the desktop's launch gate reads it, so a command app
declares nothing.

The desktop resolves every launch through **one funnel**
(`tairix_desktop_session::resolve_launch`), which in order:

1. looks the bundle's entry path up in the launch table. **No live instance
   means spawn** — and the manifest is not even read, because there is
   nothing to reach, so the answer cannot depend on what it says;
2. reads whether the bundle runs one instance, from the same
   one-read-per-bundle cache the icon-bar identity comes from. It is
   cache-only, deliberately: a launch is a click, and a click may not wait on
   the filesystem (`AGENTS.md` §28). A bundle the session has not resolved is
   treated as a singleton, the conservative answer;
3. hands the request to the live instance. A launch that **names a target** has
   exactly one route — the target itself — and is all-or-nothing: an instance
   that will not take it spawns instead, which still shows what the user asked
   for, whereas asking for a bare window would raise an empty one and lose the
   target. A launch that names **nothing** asks the instance's **icon-bar
   default** action (a new window), then **raises** its most recent window;
4. **fails closed to spawning.** An instance that cannot be reached at all —
   no window, no icon-bar presence, a mailbox that has gone — is spawned as
   before, so a launch never silently does nothing.

The funnel is reachable by a launcher that is **not** the desktop, through
`WindowRequest::HandOverLaunch`: without it a file manager that spawns a viewer
per document bypasses the funnel entirely and a bundle declaring one instance
gets several. The reply is `Reached` or `NotRunning` — "not running" is an
answer rather than a refusal, and is what tells the caller to launch the bundle
itself. The live instance is resolved from the **resident** icon-bar slot (the
bundle each slot-holder was launched from, which the strip already records for
its icons), so an application that declared no icon-bar presence is not
resident and is not found — the same reason a bare launch cannot ask it for its
default action.

## Handing a document to a running instance

A relaunch that names a folder or a file reaches the running instance through
a **wake plus a pull**, because a `WindowEvent` is a fixed 40-byte frame and
every event pays the widest event's width — a path is far wider than one.

- `WindowEvent::OpenRequested` is the wake. It says only *you have at least one
  target waiting*, and it is **application**-scoped, like the icon-bar events:
  the instance a hand-over most needs to reach is the one with nothing open, so
  a window-scoped wake would leave a resident application unreachable. It
  travels to the application's declared icon-bar route, or failing that to the
  event endpoint of its most recent window.
- `WindowRequest::TakeOpenTarget` is the pull, and names nothing — the queue is
  the calling application's, whose identity the kernel attests. The reply is
  the oldest queued target, or the empty answer once the queue is drained.
  Popping is what makes a target one-shot, so no id is minted or validated and
  the ordering is the protocol. An application drains in a loop: one event may
  cover several targets, and another may arrive mid-drain.
- A queued target is one of **two** things. A `Path` names a file or folder and
  confers nothing. A `Document` is a file *already opened* by whoever handed it
  over, reachable through a one-shot delegation the kernel minted to this
  application — the only form an application that requests no filesystem
  capability can act on.
- The queue lives in the window engine beside the pending pick and the
  unanswered menu open, bounded per application by `WINDOW_MAX_OPEN_TARGETS` —
  a containment bound, not a capacity (`AGENTS.md` §24.4). Reaching it refuses
  the newest target with the refusal stated rather than dropping an older one
  silently. It dies with the client, and so does any delegation queued for it.
  One delegation handle is queued once however often it is handed over: a
  handle is one-shot and the kernel returns the *same* one for the same
  authority twice, so a second entry would promise a document the first pull
  consumes.
- Queueing and waking are **one** operation (`hand_over_open_target`),
  because they are one invariant: a queued target the owner was never woken
  for would sit unreachable. The engine confirms the instance is reachable and
  has room, wakes it, and only then asks the caller for the entry — so a
  document's delegation, which the kernel cannot take back, is minted only for
  an instance that takes it, and a refusal at any step leaves nothing queued
  and nothing delegated. The caller may therefore read the answer as "the
  instance has it".
- A **path** confers no access. The application opens it under its own
  authority, exactly as it would a path in its own argument list — which is
  why `files.app` puts every open target through the very same
  `location_components` rule its command line's starting location goes
  through.
- A **document**'s authority is relayed, never lent. The grant arrives minted
  by the *asking* process to the session, from a descriptor that process opened
  under its own `CAP_FS_ACCESS`; the session redeems it and hands the same
  authority on to the instance, and the kernel copies the **first** grantor's
  captured identity onto the onward delegation rather than re-capturing it. So
  the document is read under the authority of whoever opened it, never the
  session's own larger reach, and there is deliberately no way to ask the
  session to open a *path* on an application's behalf. A refused relay
  delegates nothing and answers `NotRunning`, so the caller spawns — which
  still shows the document.
- The one document the session opens itself is one the **user** opens from
  the desktop: a double-click on a file icon is the user's own gesture on a
  listing the session shows, exactly as a pick in the trusted picker is. The
  session opens it through the same rule the file manager uses
  (`tairix_browse::document::open_for`) and hands the descriptor on — to a
  running instance as a `Document` target, or to a fresh process on its
  standard input — never the path, which an application that requests no
  filesystem capability could do nothing with.
- A document is handed over **read-write** only when the application's signed
  manifest claims to edit what it opens (`document-access = "read-write"`,
  `docs/src/abi/appinfo.md`) *and* the user may write it; otherwise, and on a
  read-only volume, it is opened read-only. A writable delegation carries the
  reach its opener held (`GRANT_EXTENT_INHERIT`), which the kernel keeps or
  shrinks but never widens. A fresh launch is told which it got by
  `DOCUMENT_WRITABLE_ROLE_ARG` in place of `DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG`, a running
  instance by its `Document` target's `writable`, and a pick by
  `FilePicked`'s. The trusted picker opens a chosen document by this rule
  too.

## An overlay is a popup surface, never pixels in the app's own window

A menu, a settings sheet, a tooltip, or any other transient overlay drawn
*inside* an app's window surface is clipped the moment the user shrinks that
window, and cannot be larger than its owner. So an app opens each overlay as
its own **popup surface** — undecorated, positioned by the app, stacked
directly above the window that owns it (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW6; the protocol
side is [Window manager](./wm.md#app-owned-popup-surfaces)).

Uniformly, for every app:

- `WindowClient::create_popup(&PopupSpec { .. })` names the app's own parent
  window, the popup's granted frame region and event endpoint, its geometry,
  and an offset in physical pixels **from the parent's client origin** — an
  app is never told its own window's screen position, so it never computes a
  screen point. The session resolves the parent's live origin and clamps the
  whole popup onto the screen, which is why an overlay *larger* than its
  owner's window (a settings sheet over a tiny window) opens whole: the app
  asks for the offset that would centre it and lets the clamp do the rest.
- The popup is sized from the **overlay's** own preferred extent, measured
  against the screen rather than the window — so shrinking the window can no
  longer shrink the menu or the sheet.
- The overlay's events arrive under the popup's own window id with
  **popup-local** coordinates, so one event mailbox serves both windows and
  the app demultiplexes on `WindowEvent::window_id`, hit-testing the overlay
  against the popup's own viewport. The app's own window keeps drawing
  nothing of the overlay.
- Dismissing the overlay closes the popup and unmaps its region; closing the
  app's window takes any popup with it, and a popup counts against the same
  per-client window budget as an ordinary window.
- Showing an overlay is an incidental, refusable action: a refused popup is
  stated on `stderr` and simply not shown — never a crash, and never a
  fallback to a clipped in-window draw (`AGENTS.md` §2.24, §5.4).

The graphical terminal is the first consumer: its settings sheet is a popup
(`plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md` §9). Its window menu is not — that is the desktop's
one menu chain ([Menus](menus.md)).

An overlay's picture is **retained between frames**, exactly as the terminal's
grid picture is, and its paint is scoped to what the round reported. The
sheet's `Slider`s, `Toggle`s and rows report the rectangles they change into
the shared damage sink ([Controls](../lib/controls.md)); the terminal's
`SheetScreen` is what those reports are worth something to — it clips the
render to them and presents only that rectangle. Without it a slider drag cost
the whole sheet per pointer sample: a screen-sized surface allocated afresh,
every tab, row, label and swatch re-rendered, and the whole popup presented,
several dozen times a second, so the knob lagged the pointer. A change no
control could have reported — a re-theme, a new scale, a frame region the
session took back — covers the sheet instead, which is that change's true scope
(`AGENTS.md` §28). A profile adopted from the store, or edited in another
window, is reported row by row by the sheet itself, and leaves a drag, the
selected well and the focus where they were.

**A control's own report is never the whole scope.** An overlay composes state
*above* its controls, and every such change is the overlay's to report or the
retained picture keeps showing the old one. Four kinds are the host's, and the
sheet resolves its geometry once per routing pass so each report names the very
rectangle the control was hit-tested and drawn in: switching a tab replaces
every row of the body and re-clamps the bar beside it, so both bands are the
scope; a value written back into a control is also spelled out in the label
next to it, so the whole row is; a scroll moves every row, so the body is; and
a mark of the host's own — keyboard focus, the scheme dot, the colour picker
the selected colour well points at another well — costs the elements it moves
between. A host that scopes its paint to its controls' reports alone leaves the
tab it came from on screen (`plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md` §9).

The sheet's body scrolls in pixels through the shared `ScrollView`: its rows
are laid out whole and a row the body's edge crosses is drawn cut by it, with
only the part that shows taking the pointer. The wheel over the body or its bar
scrolls it and moves no keyboard focus; a key on a row scrolls the least that
shows that row.

## Filesystem browser (`tairix-files` over `lib/browse`)

The filesystem browser navigates the §16 filesystem layout and renders the
current directory through the active theme. It is split into a navigation
**model** and a **renderer**, both driven by an injected directory-read seam,
so the security-relevant logic is testable without a kernel (`AGENTS.md` §7).
The engine — the model, the renderer and its row hit-test, and the validated
path spelling described below — lives in the shared `lib/browse` crate
(`tairix-browse`), because the desktop session's trusted file picker
(`plans/APPWIN.md` AW5) drives exactly the same engine; the `tairix-files`
package is only the `Run` binary that composes it over the live syscalls.

### The directory-read seam

`DirectorySource::list(components)` returns the children of an absolute path
(root-first components; the empty slice is `/`). On a running system the seam
is a capability-checked VFS directory read, so the §5.3 permission decision and
the §16 path policy live in the VFS, not in the app. The browser shows exactly
the entries the source returns — it never fabricates a `/proc`/`/sys`-style
synthetic entry (`AGENTS.md` §16.1). Each entry is an `Entry` carrying a name,
an `EntryKind`, and the display metadata a file manager needs (see below).

The answer is a `Listing`, and it has two normal forms. A source that reads the
directory on the calling thread answers `Listing::Ready` and is the simple case.
One that reads it *elsewhere* — every interactive surface in the tree, whose
loop must not stall on a directory a slow disk is still walking — answers
`Listing::Pending`, and the embedder asks again when its own wake says the
answer has landed. Both the desktop session (its icon column and its trusted
picker) and the file manager's own browser read that way, through the shared
`ListingDesk` policy. A
refusal is the `Err` half and is a third thing entirely: pending is never an
error, and an error is never retried by waiting. Nothing in the engine polls or
sleeps; the party that owns the wake decides when to ask again.

A reload — the browser's own refresh, and the re-read after a rename, a new
folder, a delete or a paste — asks `DirectorySource::refresh` rather than `list`: it is asked
because the directory may just have changed, so it is answered only by a read
that begins after it, never by one already under way. A source that reads on
the calling thread is fresh by construction and answers exactly as `list` does.

While a navigation is pending the browser has moved **nothing** — not the
location, not the entries, not either history. `Browser::resume` asks the source
again and commits the move (with exactly the history change the original gesture
owed) only once the listing is there, so the transactional, fail-closed guarantee
a synchronous listing had is unchanged: a refusal leaves the view precisely where
it was. `Browser::is_listing` is what the shared renderer draws its cue from.

### Entries, kinds, and the shared sort

An `Entry` carries its name, its `EntryKind`, its apparent `size`, and its
last-modification `Time64` — the size and timestamp mapped straight from the
one `fs_readdir` stream the source already produced (each
`tairix_abi::fs::DirEntry` reports them, alongside the node identity and name
count a hard-link-aware walk such as `du` keys on), so the browser never opens
and `fs_stat`s every child to fill a listing (`AGENTS.md` §2.16). `EntryKind`
refines the VFS's file/directory/link split with the one distinction a
manager must make structurally: a `<Name>.app` directory is a `Bundle` — a
sealed unit the user launches, not a folder to descend into
(`AGENTS.md` §16.5). The engine only *models* the distinction
(`Entry::is_bundle`, and `is_directory` is `false` for a bundle so
`open_index` refuses to descend); deciding what a bundle activation *does*
is the launching layer's job.

A **symbolic link** is two facts about one entry, and a file manager needs
both: it must *show* the link and *act* on the target. So
`EntryKind::Link(LinkTarget)` carries the resolution beside the link rather
than being flattened into it, and `Entry::target()` carries the spelling the
link stores (verbatim — possibly relative, possibly naming nothing), which
the properties sheet shows and a launch resolves. Three readings follow, and
they are deliberately different questions:

- `is_directory()` / `is_bundle()` follow the **target**, so a shortcut to a
  folder is descended and a shortcut to an application launches.
- `is_directory_backed()` is `false` for *every* link however it resolves —
  the **structural** reading a management verb takes. A link is a leaf on
  disk: removing one unlinks the link (never `UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY`), and
  recursing into one would walk a tree the name only points at.
- `resolved()` is the **content** reading a sort key, an icon, or an
  application association takes; a link that names nothing resolves to
  `None` rather than to a guessed kind.

Bundle-ness is decided from the **target's** leaf name, not the link's: a
desktop shortcut is named for the application (`Editor`) while its target is
the bundle (`/Apps/Editor.app`), so classifying on the link's own name would
show a shortcut to an application as a plain folder. A `fs_readdir` stream
reports only *that* a child is a link, so the resolution comes from an
injected `LinkReader` (`readlink` plus one resolving `fs_stat`, paid only for
the link entries; the shipped `RtLinkReader` is the one implementation every
surface shares). A link the reader cannot describe classifies as
`LinkTarget::Dangling` — the honest answer, never a silent downgrade to a
plain file. Activation descends or opens *through* the link, but launches a
bundle by its **resolved** path, because the spawn gate parses an entry point
as `…/<Name>.app/Run` and a link named after the program is not that shape.

`SortMode` (`SortKey` — `Name`/`Size`/`Modified` — plus a `SortDirection`)
is the one listing order both the file manager and the trusted picker share
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2): directories first, then the chosen key, with a
case-insensitive name tiebreak so the result never depends on the source's
incidental order. `sort_entries` is the pure definition; the `Browser`
applies it to every listing and `set_sort_mode` re-orders in place, keeping
the selection on the same entry. The default is name-ascending — a
general-purpose directory order.

### The production source (`vfs`)

`VfsDirectorySource` is the shipping `DirectorySource` (`plans/APPWIN.md`
AW1). It composes three pieces, each host-proven:

- `spell_absolute_path` — the app's one path spelling, shared by the
  browser's displayed path, the tests' tree keys, and the VFS fetch, so the
  three can never disagree (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).
- `absolute_path` — validation before spelling: a component that is empty,
  `.`, `..`, or carries `/`/NUL is refused (`OutOfRange`) *before* any
  syscall, and the spelled path is bounded by the kernel's `FS_PATH_MAX`
  (`LengthOutOfRange`) — validate every input, fail closed (`AGENTS.md`
  §5.4).
- `entries_from_dir_stream` — the packed `fs_readdir` stream mapped onto
  `Entry` values through the shared `tairix_abi::fs::DirEntries` walker (the
  same walker `ls` lists through); one malformed record or non-UTF-8 name
  refuses the whole listing, never a partial one.

The directory fetch itself is injected (`fetch(path) -> stream`): the
shipping program passes `tairix_rt::read_dir_all` — the kernel-authorised
`fs_open` + grow-to-`FS_IO_MAX` `fs_readdir` transfer under the app's own
attested identity — while tests pass an in-memory tree of encoded streams and
drive a `Browser` over it end to end. The engine adds no authority and makes
no permission decision of its own.

### The navigation model

`Browser` holds the current directory's path and entries plus a selection
cursor:

- `open_root` opens at `/` and lists it; `open_at(source, components)` opens
  *at* a given directory (root-first `components`, empty being `/`, so
  `open_root` is exactly `open_at(source, [])`). The window title carries that
  path and `go_up` climbs from there, with a fresh (empty) history — the one
  way a consumer starts somewhere other than `/` without a second navigation
  model. The desktop session's trusted picker opens at the user's home this
  way (below).
- `open_index` / `open_selected` descend into a directory entry; `go_up`
  climbs to the parent and returns `Ok(false)` at the root (no parent is not
  an error).
- `refresh` re-reads the current directory, clamping the selection into the
  new listing.
- `select`, `select_next`, and `select_previous` move the selection, clamping
  at both ends.

`Browser` also keeps a bounded **navigation history**, which the toolbar's
Back / Forward tools drive:

- `go_back` / `go_forward` walk a back / forward stack; `can_go_back` /
  `can_go_forward` report whether each move is available, which is exactly
  the enable state of the Back / Forward toolbar controls. Any fresh
  navigation (descend, climb, or a jump to a location) records the directory
  it left on the back stack and clears the forward branch, as a web
  browser's forward history is discarded on a new turn.

The history is a bounded ring: once it reaches its cap it drops the
*oldest* location rather than growing without bound. It is a UX
convenience, not a hardware-scaled resource, so the bound is a deliberate
defensive cap (§24), and reaching it never fails a navigation — it simply
forgets the least-recent step.

Every directory-listing move is **transactional and fails closed**
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4): the target is listed *before* any state changes, so a
refused or failing read leaves the browser on the directory it was already
showing — a `go_back` / `go_forward` / location jump to a directory that
has become unreadable leaves the browser *and its history* exactly as they
were. The fail-closed outcomes are the `BrowseError` variants: `Source`
(the wrapped boundary `Errno`, e.g. `PermissionDenied`), `NoSuchEntry`, and
`NotADirectory`.

### The frame model — the toolbar

The drawn window chrome — the `lib/controls` toolbar
(`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM4b) — is painted from a pure
`chrome` model, host-proven ahead of the widgets it drives, exactly as the
`Activation` and `open_with` decisions are:

- `ToolbarModel::for_browser(browser)` snapshots which `ToolbarCommand` is
  currently actionable. **Back / Forward / Up** reflect the navigation
  history and depth (`can_go_back` / `can_go_forward` / `!is_root`);
  **Refresh**, the **view toggle**, and **Sort** are always available.
  `is_enabled(command)` gives the drawn button its enabled state — an
  unavailable tool renders *disabled*, never hidden, so the toolbar's shape
  stays stable — and `view_mode()` / `sort_mode()` give the view toggle and
  sort control their current (pressed) state. `TOOLBAR_COMMANDS` is the one
  left-to-right command order the chrome iterates.
- `ContextMenuModel::for_browser(browser, has_clipboard)` snapshots which
  `ContextCommand` the right-click menu offers is actionable. **Open**,
  **Rename**, **Cut**, **Copy**, **Properties**, and **Delete** act on the
  selected entry, so they need a selection (an empty directory offers none).
  **Open With…** is offered only for a regular file — a directory descends and
  a bundle launches itself, so neither has an application to choose.
  **Paste** targets the current directory and needs only a held clipboard,
  not a selection; because the clipboard lives in the app rather than the
  browser (`Browser::clipboard` *captures* a fresh one from the selection),
  whether a paste is possible is the app's own state, threaded in as
  `has_clipboard`. `is_enabled(command)` gives each drawn `MenuItem` its
  enabled state (an inapplicable command renders *disabled*, never hidden),
  and `CONTEXT_COMMANDS` is the one top-to-bottom order the drawn menu
  iterates.

The model decides *what is offered*; it performs
no navigation or I/O itself, so composing it grants nothing (the read-only
picker builds the same model). Only commands the file manager can actually
carry out today are modelled, so none is speculative surface (`AGENTS.md`
§2.4): **Open With…** joined the set with its FM6b chooser verb (below), and
**Delete** joined it with FM9-c's confirm-and-remove verb (its `begin_delete`
action, below). **New Folder** is a
*write* tool that lives on the manager-only toolbar (below), not on this menu
shared with the read-only picker.

**The context menu is the desktop's, and the file manager draws no menu
pixel.** A secondary-button (right-click) press selects the item under the
pointer — or clears the selection on empty space, so only the directory-scoped
Paste is offered — and asks the desktop's one menu service to bring a chain up
([menus](./menus.md)): `chrome::context_menu` declares one row per
`CONTEXT_COMMANDS` entry carrying that command's `label()` and keyboard
`shortcut()`, and the `Run` binary sends it as a `WindowRequest::OpenMenu`
anchored at the window-local point the press was reported at — the only space
the application can speak truthfully, since it is never told where its window
sits. The desktop titles the plate (the application's own name), places it,
draws it, holds the grab, traverses it by keyboard, and dismisses it.

A command the model reports inapplicable is declared **disabled with its
reason** rather than left out, so the menu's shape does not move with the
selection and a row says *why* it cannot be chosen — `ContextMenuModel::reason`
is the one rule, and `is_enabled` is derived from it, so a row can never grey
out with nothing to say. The desktop shows that reason as a tooltip when the
pointer rests on the row; it is never drawn beside the label, which is what
made this plate as wide as "only a file opens with an application". Removal declares the destructive emphasis. A row's id
is its command's position in `CONTEXT_COMMANDS`, so `context_command_from_item`
reads a chosen row back through the exact inverse of numbering it.

The answer is exactly one `WindowEvent::MenuClosed` naming the open id the
window minted, so an answer to a gesture already settled cannot run a stale
command; the `Run` binary routes the chosen command through
`dispatch_context_command` to the **exact same** app verbs the toolbar and
keyboard already drive — Open (`activate`), Open and Close (the same activation
with the window closed behind the hand-off), Open With… (the chooser below),
Rename, Cut, Copy, Paste, Properties, and Delete (the same modal-confirmed
`begin_delete` the `Delete` key opens, below) — so the menu can never diverge
from them (`AGENTS.md` §2.2) and adds no authority (every verb is the user's own
§5.3-checked action). A refused open is an answer: it is stated on `stderr` and
the window carries on with no menu, never drawing one of its own.

**Two of those rows carry a child as well as a command**, which is what a
chevron on them means (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` M6). **Rename** opens the in-place
editor when clicked, and arriving on it opens a desktop-drawn quick-entry field
pre-filled with the current name: type, press `Enter`, and the name is
committed through the very same `Browser::rename_selected` — the same
permission-checked `fs_rename` under the user's own identity — that `F2` runs.
The two answers are distinct ids, so neither can be read as the other, and the
typed text is pulled from the desktop rather than delivered, because an event
frame is far narrower than a name. **Open With…** opens the chooser when
clicked and a submenu of the applications that claim the file when arrived on
(below). Both children are offered only where the row itself can act, so a
field can never commit a rename the model says cannot happen.

**A desktop shortcut, not a taskbar pin, is how an application gets a second
place to launch from.** Taskbar pinning was removed from the design
(`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md`), so the file manager offers no pin command and the
window channel carries no pin or drag-offer request. The program library's own
row menu creates a desktop shortcut instead — a symbolic link to the bundle,
resolved by the desktop session under its own authority
(`plans/SYMLINKS.md` S5).

The **toolbar is now drawn and clickable**. `render` paints the
`TOOLBAR_COMMANDS` as a `lib/controls` `Toolbar` of themed `IconButton`s in
the top strip, each glyph from `ToolbarCommand::icon()` and each rendered
enabled or disabled from the `ToolbarModel` (a disabled tool reads muted, not
hidden). A primary-button press resolves through `render::toolbar_command_at` —
which mirrors the drawn toolbar's own layout across the whole window and returns
**only an enabled command** (a click on a disabled tool or a group gutter
resolves to nothing, failing closed) — and runs through the one shared
`apply_command(browser, command)`. `apply_command` is a **read-only** dispatch
(history / climb / refresh / view toggle / sort cycle), so the picker drives the
same toolbar; Back/Forward/Up/Refresh are the browser's transactional, fail-closed
navigation, and the view toggle and sort each step to the next mode
(`ViewMode::toggled`, `SortMode::next` — a fixed six-mode cycle). The
keyboard drives the same dispatch through accelerators: **Alt+←/→** (Back /
Forward), **Alt+↑** (Up), and **F5** (Refresh), so a shortcut and a toolbar
click can never diverge (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The view toggle and sort are
toolbar (pointer) commands; a conventional single-key accelerator for them
awaits the later toolbar keyboard-focus pass.

**The manager-only write tools.** The read-only picker composes the
exact same toolbar (`render`, `apply_command`), so a *write* action can never
live in the shared `ToolbarCommand` / `apply_command` surface — that would hand
the picker write authority. The manager tools are therefore a distinct
`chrome::ManagerTool` vocabulary (`MANAGER_TOOLS`, `ManagerTool::icon()`) —
New Folder, the **Go to Trash** location, and **Empty Trash**
(`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM11b) — that
**only a write-capable consumer hands to `render`**: the file manager passes
`MANAGER_TOOLS` (with a `chrome::ManagerToolModel` enable snapshot), the picker
passes an empty slice and `ManagerToolModel::none()`, so the picker cannot draw
or resolve a write tool (the separation is by type, not a runtime flag).
`render` draws the write tools in their own toolbar group after the read-only
commands — each muted (never hidden) when the model reports it inactive, so
Empty Trash reads disabled outside a non-empty Trash — and
`render::manager_tool_at` is their mirror hit-test, resolving **only an enabled
tool** (a read-only command's position is unchanged whether or not write tools
follow). The `files.app` `Run`
binary routes a click on the tool — and the **Ctrl+Shift+N** keyboard
equivalent — to a new folder: `mkdir::suggest_new_dir_name` names a
non-clashing placeholder, `Browser::create_directory` creates it through the
`fs_mkdir` seam under the user's own identity (**no new capability** — the
per-inode owner/mode/ACL model gates it), and the inline rename opens on the
new folder so the user names it at once. A refused create states its reason on
`stderr` and leaves the listing put — an answer, not a crash (`AGENTS.md`
§2.24, §5.4).

### Activating an entry

Opening an entry — a double-click, or `Enter` on the selection — is one
dispatch-by-kind decision, `Browser::activate_selected` / `activate_index`,
returning an `Activation` (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM6). It lives in the
engine, not the app, so the file manager and the trusted picker act
identically (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). It is exhaustive over the three entry kinds:

- a **directory** is *descended into* by the engine itself (its own
  transactional, fail-closed navigation) and returns `Descended` — there is
  nothing for the caller to launch;
- an **application bundle** (`<Name>.app`) returns `LaunchBundle { path }`,
  naming the bundle for the caller to launch through the ordinary signed
  app-load gate;
- a **regular file** returns `OpenFile { path }`, naming the file for the
  caller to open in the associated viewer.

A bundle is both a program and a directory, so activating one is genuinely
ambiguous and the caller passes a `BundleIntent` saying which the *gesture*
meant: `Launch` runs it, `Browse` descends into it and returns `Descended`
like any other directory (through the link, when the entry is one). The
caller names the intent, never the kind — dispatch-by-kind stays in the
engine.

The target's absolute path is spelled through the one shared `absolute_path`,
so a launch or open can never name a different node than the browser shows;
a name that cannot be spelled as a valid, bounded absolute path fails closed
as `BrowseError::Source`, exactly as descending into it already does. The
engine holds **no** launch or open authority of its own: it decides *what* the
target is and *what should happen*, never performing the spawn or the
`fs_open` — those stay in the app's own capability-checked tail under the
launching user's identity (so the read-only picker composes the same
`Browser` and simply never launches).

The `files.app` `Run` binary acts on this decision when the user presses
`Enter`, **double-clicks an item**, and chooses **Open** from the right-click
menu — all three route through the one shared `activate`, so a pointer
double-click can never open something a keyboard `Enter` would not
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). Three gestures and one menu row reach it, and which one a
press is comes from the app's own pure, host-tested `gesture` module:

| gesture | what it does |
|---|---|
| double-click / `Enter` | activate: descend, run a bundle, or open a file |
| shift-double-click / `Shift+Enter` | list a bundle's contents instead of running it |
| right-click | ask the desktop for the context menu on the item |
| the **Open and Close** menu row | activate, then close this window |

There is no right-*double*-click. The menu the first press opens is the
desktop's chain and holds the seat's grab, so the second press is consumed there
and never reaches the application — which is a property of the design, not a
gap: an application never sees a press inside chrome it does not own. The "open
this and I am done here" verb is a menu row instead, which is discoverable and
reachable from the keyboard as the gesture never was
(`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D20).

The pairing is the shared, pure `click::DoubleClickTracker`
(`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM12), keyed on the **button** as well as the item:
a press selects the item under the pointer, and a second press *of the same
button* on that *same* item within the desktop's double-click interval (the one
the session publishes in `DesktopInfo::double_click`, timed by the
capability-free monotonic `clock_get`) completes the gesture. One
press of each button is therefore two gestures begun, never one completed. The
tracker is reset whenever a press lands on chrome (a toolbar tool) rather than
an item, and by a right-click, so neither a click *through* the chrome and back
nor a click either side of a menu is mistaken for a double-click; a
non-monotonic clock reading fails closed to a single click.

The modifier a shift-double-click carries reaches the app on the pointer event
itself (`WindowEvent::Pointer`'s `modifiers`, stamped by the seat): a modifier
key reaches no surface as a key, so an app could not otherwise know one is
held. `Shift+Enter` is the same intent from the keyboard, resolved through the
one `gesture::bundle_intent` spelling so the two cannot diverge.

Open and Close closes the window **only** once the entry has been handed
to another program (`AfterHandoff::CloseWindow` on a `LaunchBundle` or
`OpenFile`). A folder just listed *is* the window's new content, so closing it
would leave the user with nothing — which is why the row is offered only over a
file or a bundle and states "a folder opens in this window" otherwise, rather
than being drawn and quietly not closing.

On any activation,
a `Descended` reveals the selection and repaints, and a
`LaunchBundle { path }` **launches the bundle** — its own `Launcher` spawns the
bundle's own `Run` (`<path>/Run`) through the ordinary signed app-load gate
(`CAP_PROC_SPAWN`, added to the manifest in the stage that first uses it),
under the launching user's identity and with no ambient authority. The launch
is **asynchronous and non-blocking** (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`): `spawn` admits
the child and returns its PID before the image loads, so the event loop never
freezes behind a load; a synchronous refusal is stated fail-loud on `stderr` at
once, and a load refusal that only shows once the image is read surfaces later
as the child's reserved `LOAD_*` exit status, named by the reap (the shared
`load_failure_reason` wording). The manager **reaps** every launched child on a
new any-child wait-set member, drained in the event source's park branch the
instant it fires, so a launched app is never left a zombie and the wake never
degrades into a busy-poll (`AGENTS.md` §2.23). An `OpenFile { path }`
decision **opens the file in its associated viewer** — the inherited-document
hand-off, the TAIRiX spelling of `viewer < file`: the manager resolves the
associated application from the installed bundles' declared file-type
associations (the reader's warm scan + `applications_for`, keyed off the file's
leaf name — never a hard-coded viewer path; a document opened before the first
scan has landed waits for it), opens the file **in its own table** on its
reader thread, so a slow disk never stalls the window — read-only, or
read-write for an application whose signed manifest claims to edit its
documents — and spawns that bundle's `Run` with the descriptor wired
onto the child's `STDIN` slot (`FdWire::Handle`) plus the reserved
`DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` (or `DOCUMENT_WRITABLE_ROLE_ARG`) token and the leaf name
for the window title. The kernel clones the open description into the child
owner-checked and **confers** it — the child's
descriptor carries the manager's captured identity, exactly as a `fd_grant`
delegation carries its grantor's — so the viewer reads its document with **no
filesystem capability of its own** (least privilege) and there is no
post-spawn channel or ordering race; the manager closes its own descriptor
immediately and reaps the child on the same any-child member as a launched
bundle. Launching is asynchronous and fail-loud: a file no installed
application claims leaves the listing unchanged and states the refusal on
`stderr`, never a fabricated open (`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The viewer detects
`DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` at start-up and displays the handed-over document instead
of prompting the session's trusted picker (its standalone launch is
unchanged).

**A file can be dragged onto an application's icon-bar slot.** A primary
press on a regular file arms a drag, and travelling past `DRAG_SLOP` logical
pixels hands it to the desktop (`WindowClient::begin_drag`); a drag the desktop
will not carry stays the press it was. When it ends dropped on an application,
the manager takes the drop target and opens the file for it through the very
`launch_viewer` path "Open With" uses, so the application receives the same
authority whichever gesture chose it.

**"Open With…" is two things, and the row is both.** Arriving on it opens a
**submenu** of the applications that claim the file — the highest-ranked few
(`OPEN_WITH_QUICK_MAX`), each drawing its own application icon, so the common
case is one gesture inside the menu with the right picture to aim at. Clicking
the row itself opens the **chooser**, which is the complete list.

The split is forced by what a plate is. A plate does not scroll, and the
candidate set is as long as the applications a user has installed, so no plate
can promise to hold all of it — the quick list is deliberately the top of the
ranked order and the chooser remains the whole of it. And the desktop's menu
model crosses the wire *complete* — every row of every plate in the one open —
so the candidates must exist before the menu does. The file manager therefore
keeps its bundle scan **warm** on the worker it already uses: a
right-click reads the answer that has already landed and performs no I/O at
all, and asks again so the next gesture is current. Before the first scan lands
the row simply carries no chevron and its click opens the chooser
(`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §6, decision 2).

Choosing **Open With…** resolves the file's absolute path (the one shared
`selected_target_path` spelling), enumerates the full `applications_for`
candidate list over that scan, and — when at least one application claims
the type — opens an `OpenWithChooser` in **its own popup window** above the
manager's, sized to the candidates it actually holds (never a fixed eight rows'
worth of empty plate).

The popup opens with the same `render::Identity` band the Properties window
does, naming and picturing the file being opened — so the question the chooser
is asking is on the surface rather than in a title. Below it sits one `ListRow`
per candidate in ranked order, each drawing **that application's own icon**
through the shared artwork cache (the chooser previously resolved through
`NoArtwork`, so every candidate wore the same generic bundle glyph and the user
chose between names). The candidate a plain *Open* would have used carries a
trailing **Default** mark, because the chooser exists to override exactly that
choice. **Open** and **Cancel** sit on a control-height band at the foot, so
the way out is drawn rather than guessed.

The list is reached in full however long it is: by wheel
(`open_with_scroll_wheel`), by the drawn scrollbar's drag (which routes through
the very `ScrollColumn` rule the listing's bar does, so the two cannot behave
differently), and by Up/Down/Home/End with the selection revealed whole
(`open_with_reveal`). It rests at any pixel, and a row its edge crosses is
drawn cut and pressed where it shows. A **single** primary press on a row resolved through
`render::open_with_row_at` (which mirrors the draw's placement, so paint and
click cannot disagree, `AGENTS.md` §2.2) *picks* that candidate; a
**double-click**, `Enter`, or the **Open** button launches it through the
**same** `DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` + `STDIN` hand-off the default open uses. The
pairing is the shared `DoubleClickTracker` the listing behind it uses, so a
double-click means one thing on both surfaces. Picking and opening are separate
acts deliberately: a press that launched at once left the Open button with
nothing to do and spawned an application on a mis-click, with no chance to look
at the choice. `Escape`, the **Cancel** button, or the window manager asking
the popup to close dismisses it and launches nothing; a press on the panel's
own plate picks nothing and leaves the chooser standing.

**The popup is a window, so its events are addressed to its own id.** The
session focuses a popup when it opens, so every key and click for the chooser
arrives naming the popup rather than the manager window that holds it.
`files.app` resolves an event's window through the shared, host-tested
`route::addressee`, which reports both *which* window an id belongs to and
*which of its two surfaces* was named — matching a window's own id before any
popup's, so a live window's events can never be diverted. Getting either half
wrong is silent: an id matched against the window list alone resolves to
nothing, so every event for the chooser was dropped and the popup sat on screen
inert; matching it to its owner without distinguishing the two would resize,
release, or close the manager window on an event the popup was sent. The
chooser's events never reach the listing behind it either — routing this
window's coordinates against the popup's own viewport could land on the Open
button and launch something the user never picked.

A file no installed application claims is stated fail-loud on `stderr` and opens
nothing — an honest "no application" answer, never an empty chooser
(`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The default open still picks the first association; the
chooser lets the user pick any of them.

### File-type classification — the one content-type registry

`lib/browse::media` is the single closed registry that both the icon a tile
draws and the "Open With…" association vocabulary read, so the two can never
drift apart (`AGENTS.md` §2.2):

- `MediaType` names each content type by its IANA (or TAIRiX vendor)
  media-type spelling; `MediaType::as_str` and `MediaType::from_media_str`
  round-trip it, case-insensitively. The enum is **closed** — an unrecognised
  spelling is simply not one the registry knows (`None`, never a free-form
  string at a draw or association site).
- `Ending::of(name)` is what ends a name: a RISC OS file type after its last
  comma (`,ff9`, three hex digits) and an extension after the last dot before
  it, each only after a stem, so `.png` and `,b60` alone end in nothing; its
  `stem` is what they follow. The Trash numbers a clashing name before its
  ending (`Logo (2),b60`), the kind sort clusters by its extension, and Paint
  names a sprite after a file's stem, all by this one rule.
  `media_for_name(name)` maps that ending to its type — a file type the
  registry knows first, else the extension — ASCII-case-insensitively and
  without allocating, and `name_endings(media)` lists the endings a type is
  known by, the ones a save holds a name to; `media_for_named(name, kind,
  service_store)` classifies a node known only by its name and kind —
  `inode/directory` for a directory whatever its name,
  `application/x-tairix-service` for a `<Name>.app` in the system service store
  and `application/x-tairix-app` elsewhere, and the extension's type for a
  regular file, falling closed to `application/octet-stream`; a link classifies
  as what it *names*, and a dangling one as the generic type.
  `media_for_entry(entry, parent)` is that same rule for a listed entry, whose
  parent directory is what answers the service-store question. A surface
  describing *one* node — the Properties window's identity band — has only the
  name and kind, so it classifies through the same definition rather than
  growing a private copy.
- `MediaType::icon` is the glyph the type draws. That mapping is deliberately
  many-to-one and is the *only* part of the registry allowed to be: several
  distinct types share `IconKind::Text`. Two types are never merged because
  they draw alike — an application whose manifest declared the vanished type
  would silently stop matching its own files.
- `MediaType::parent` is the **subclass relation**, the same one the
  freedesktop.org shared-mime-info database models (`text/x-csrc` is a
  subclass of `text/plain`). Every readable-text type names `text/plain` as its
  broader type — `image/svg+xml` reaches it through `application/xml` — and
  everything binary names none. The chain is finite and acyclic, and
  association matching walks it, so naming a format precisely (`.rs` is
  `text/x-rust`) never narrows what can open it.

### "Open With…" — the type→bundle association

Offering a file to a chosen application is a second pure engine model, the
`open_with` module (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM6b), host-proven ahead of the
app-side spawn exactly as the `Activation` decision was:

- `media_for_name(name)` derives a file's content type from the ending of its
  name through the shared content-type registry above — the one bridge
  from a name (all a VFS listing gives) to the MIME vocabulary a bundle's
  signed `AppInfo` declares its associations in. An unknown or absent extension
  yields `None`, never a guess.
- `applications_for(name, bundles)` returns the `AppAssociation`s whose
  declared MIME set handles the file's type **or any broader type it is a
  subclass of** (`MediaType::parent`), so an editor declaring `text/plain` is
  offered for a `.rs` file. Candidates are ordered by how specifically they
  claim the file — an application declaring `text/x-rust` comes before one
  declaring `text/plain` — and bundles claiming at the same level keep the
  source's enumeration order. No match is an **honest empty answer** — the
  caller shows a "no application" notice (`AGENTS.md` §2.24), never a crash and
  never a fabricated default.

The type decision is a **display hint only**, like the icon classifier: it
decides which applications are *offered*, and the ordinary signed load gate
still verifies and capability-checks whichever bundle the user picks. The
engine holds no launch authority and never opens the file — spawning the chosen
bundle and the spawn-time `FdWire::Handle` file hand-off stay in the
`files.app` `Run` binary's own capability-checked tail under the user's
identity (both the default open and the explicit chooser above), so the
read-only picker composes the same engine and never launches.

### Rendering

`render_into(surface, browser, theme, font, viewport, tools, tool_model,
artwork)` paints a command toolbar strip
and the current directory into a caller-owned `tairix-raster` `Surface` the
size of the viewport, in whichever of the two views the browser holds
(`ViewMode::List` or `ViewMode::Grid`). The caller holds that surface for the
life of its window, which is what makes a repaint clipped to the rectangles one
round reported sound: every pixel outside the clip is the one already on
screen. The **file manager opens on the icon
grid** (`MANAGER_VIEW_MODE`, with `MANAGER_TOOLBAR_BAND` saying no chrome band
is drawn) and its toolbar toggle switches to the list; the engine's own default
and the trusted file picker stay `List`, since a chooser wants names, sizes
and dates rather than tiles. Those two are engine constants rather than app
literals because where an item is *drawn* depends on them, and the QEMU
vertical that drives a gesture into a manager window reconstructs that
rectangle host-side from the same two values. `tools` is the manager-only
`ManagerTool` set drawn after the read-only commands — the file manager passes
`MANAGER_TOOLS`, the read-only picker an empty slice. The toolbar strip is drawn at the top
(see the frame model above); the item area sits below it
(`chrome_height` = the toolbar strip when it is shown, and zero when it is
not), the one header offset
the item views, the scrollbar gutter, and every hit-test share so paint and
hit-test can never disagree (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The window title carries the
current path, so no band of the window is spent restating it. In the **list**
view each entry is a
shared `lib/controls` `TableRow` with an aligned **name / size / modified**
column layout — the same collection control (and the same one column-width
definition) the trusted picker uses, so the file manager and the picker are
one coherent themed surface rather than a browser-private row painter
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). A name is spelled bare, whatever the entry is, and the row's
name cell carries the entry's icon — the same `icon_for_entry` classification
the grid tile draws, painted as the built-in glyph — so a folder is told from a
file by that icon rather than by a name suffix. The size column
is blank for a directory or bundle and otherwise the binary-unit `format_size`
(`1.5 MiB`); the modified column is `format_date` (an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, blank
at the epoch so a stampless file is never given a fabricated date, §21). In the
**grid** view each entry is a shared `lib/controls` `IconTile` — its file-type
icon over that same label, with no plate of its own, so a folder reads as a field
of icons rather than a grid of boxes and only a hovered, selected, or focused
entry paints anything behind its icon — wrapped into as many columns as fit the
width; the two views share one selection model, so toggling never moves the
selection or re-reads the directory. The icon is `icon_for_entry(entry,
parent)`: one classification both views and both consumers draw from
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2) and a
**display hint only** — it decides a glyph, never an operation; authority stays
in the VFS and the launcher. It is the shared registry's glyph
(`media_for_entry(..).icon()`, above), except that a plain directory *known* to
hold something takes the filled-folder icon instead — see *Folder occupancy*
below. `render` takes a
trailing `artwork: &mut dyn tairix_icon::IconArtwork` lookup and asks it for
each tile's icon at the exact `IconTile::icon_side` the tile reserves, blitting
the real icon artwork when the system ships and can decode it and drawing the
built-in vector glyph when it cannot — so a missing or refused asset degrades
to a meaningful icon and can never blank the tile (`AGENTS.md` §10). A tile
for an application bundle names the bundle itself in that request
(`entry_icon_request`, shared with the desktop's own icons), so `ls.app` draws
the icon `ls` carries in its own `Resources/` rather than the one generic
every-application picture. The file manager binds a real cache to that lookup
(*Grid-view icon artwork*, below); the read-only trusted picker still passes
`NoArtwork`, so it draws glyphs only.
A list row's name cell carries the same classified kind, drawn as the row
control's built-in glyph rather than through the artwork lookup. The selected
item carries the shared selection state — the raised surface plus the accent
selection rail every collection view shares — not a bespoke accent fill.

Where each item is laid out, which items show for the current scroll offset,
and the point-to-index pointer hit-test (`entry_index_at`) all come from the
one shared `layout` geometry — `ListView` and `GridView` behind the
`ViewLayout` dispatch — which clamps its scroll window through the
`lib/controls` `scroll::ScrollRange` rather than a re-derived anchor, so the
paint and the hit-test can never disagree (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The offset is in
pixels: the items are laid out unscrolled at their natural size and painted
through the view's `ScrollView`, so the listing rests at any pixel and an item
its edge crosses is drawn whole and cut there — never squeezed into what shows,
never skipped — and a press lands on whatever part of it shows. `GridView` is
**flow-parameterised** (`GridFlow`) rather than hard-wired to one direction:
`RowsFromLeading` fills a row left-to-right from the leading edge and wraps
downward, scrolling vertically — the file manager's grid — while
`ColumnsFromTrailing` fills a column downward and starts each new column one
pitch inward from the trailing edge — the
[desktop icon surface](session.md#the-desktop-icon-surface), which never
scrolls. Both flows share one cell geometry (`cell_rect` laid out,
`shown_rect` on screen), one hit-test (`entry_index_at`), and one set of counts
(`cells_per_line`, `lines_total`, and the `visible_range(offset)` the painter
iterates), so the two surfaces cannot drift apart. The tile itself is shared the same way: the
`render` helpers `grid_metrics`, `grid_tile`, and `entry_label` are public, so
the desktop paints the *same* `IconTile` — same icon side, same wrapped and
elided label, same selection state — as the file manager's grid rather than a
lookalike.

A line holds only whole tiles — a tile cut across its line could never be
scrolled whole — and the two surfaces differ in one deliberate parameter: the
`GridFill` policy for the space a line has left over once it has fitted as many
whole tiles as it can. The file
manager's window is **resizable**, so its grid takes `Spread`: the leftover width
is shared out along the row, so the gaps between the tiles widen by equal amounts
and the margins at the two ends match, and widening the window past one more tile
re-flows the listing into an extra column. Only the space between the tiles
moves; a tile never stretches, so its icon slot, label field, and hit target read
the same at every window size. The pitch is the floor, so a row that fits its
tiles exactly is laid out identically under either policy, and the pixels that
will not divide into one per gap are left as the two matching end margins rather
than making one gap wider than another. The axis the grid *scrolls* along is
never spread: rows keep the fixed pitch below the header, and the space past
the last whole row shows the next one cut, one scroll from whole. The desktop's icon
field takes `FixedPitch` instead — it is a fixed field, not resizable content, so
keeping the pitch anchored to the edge its icons hug means an icon stays where
the user last saw it whatever the work area's exact extent is. A vertical
`lib/controls` `ScrollBar` is drawn in a reserved right-edge gutter over that
same `ScrollRange` — always: with nothing to scroll, or beside the "Listing…"
cue while a folder is read, it rests its thumb the length of the track, and
the cue lays out no entry an undrawn press or scroll could reach. The wheel arrives in the seat's scroll units, already
accelerated, and `scroll_wheel` moves the listing through that bar a fixed
distance a detent, carrying what is short of a pixel to the next turn and
reporting the bar and the items it slid; a selection-moving key reveals the
selection the least it can (`reveal_selection`) — the browser owns the one
`ScrollColumn` both consume. The in-place rename editor is drawn at the name's
laid-out place (`draw_rename_field`), so it scrolls with its item.
`render::visible_range` is the one definition of which entry indices are on
screen, dispatching on the view mode over the same geometry both painters use,
so the folder-occupancy probe the app resolves before a frame asks about
exactly the rows it is about to draw.
The surface is rectangular; the compositor places and rounds it through its
single anti-aliased rounded-corner path, so there is no rounding in the app.
Every length saturates so a degenerate viewport paints what it can rather than
panicking (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).

#### A repaint costs what changed, not a window

The window holds one surface for its whole life, so a round that can say what
it moved is redrawn and copied only inside that rectangle: every pixel outside
it is the one already on screen, and the shared frame region holds the same.

Nothing in the view is a retained control — every row, tile, and rail row is
built afresh from the browser's own state each frame — so what a round moved is
the difference between two readings of that state. `sidebar::RailMark` is the
rail's (its hover, its cursor, and whether it holds the keyboard) and
`listing::ViewMark` the listing's (the focused entry and the scroll offset);
each resolves back to rectangles through the renderer's own geometry
(`render::entry_rect`, `SidebarView::shown_row_rect`, `render::item_area`), so
the reported rectangle and the painted one are the same fact. Sliding the
pointer down the rail costs the row it left and the row it entered; a second
sample inside one row costs nothing at all. A scroll draws every entry
somewhere new and moves the bar's thumb with them, so it marks the item area
and the gutter, and a scroll of the rail marks its rows and its bar. A focus
flip on the rail marks the whole rail, because a rail that holds the keyboard
draws every row as a member of the focus field.

Every other round presents the **whole** window, and that is the correct
answer rather than a deferral: replacing the listing, opening or dismissing an
overlay, running a toolbar command, a resize onto a fresh surface, and a
desktop re-theme each move more than any report could describe. A round that
reported *some* rectangles and also did one of those covers the window too —
the two conclusions are merged, never traded — and a round that changed
something and reported nothing at all still covers the window, so an
under-report can only ever cost pixels, never leave a stale frame.

### Folder occupancy

An empty folder and one that holds something draw different icons:
`IconKind::Folder` and `IconKind::FolderFilled`. A directory's `size` is `0`
and no VFS surface reports a child count, so occupancy is a separate read, and
the engine only ever draws an answer it has:

- `Entry::occupancy()` is one of four honest states — `Unprobed`, `Empty`,
  `NonEmpty`, and `Indeterminate` (a probe that was refused or failed). Only
  `NonEmpty` draws the filled folder; every other state, and every file or
  bundle, draws exactly what it drew before.
- `DirectorySource::has_children(components)` is the probe, answering
  `Probe::Ready(bool)` or `Probe::Pending`. `VfsDirectorySource` answers it
  with the cheapest honest call sequence — open the directory, read **one**
  maximal record, close — never a listing and never a walk, so the cost does
  not grow with the child count. The kernel packs a whole listing or refuses,
  so no bytes means empty, some bytes means occupied, and a listing too large
  for the one-record buffer means occupied too.
- **A source that probes elsewhere answers `Pending`, and that is what lets the
  cue be resolved from inside a paint.** The file manager's source records the
  ask and returns `Pending`; the probe runs on its reader thread and the answer
  is drawn a frame later. So the paint performs no I/O at all — it asks, which
  costs a recorded request, and draws what has already arrived (`AGENTS.md`
  §28.5). A pending entry stays `Unprobed` and is asked again on the next
  resolve, because latching a pending probe would mean the answer never
  arrived. The recorded set is probed as one batch: a screenful of folders
  answered one wake at a time would be a screenful of repaints.
- `Browser::resolve_occupancy(range)` answers only the indices its caller
  passes, and only for an entry that still needs one. The file manager passes
  `render::visible_range`, so a hundred-thousand-entry directory probes what is
  on screen rather than what is listed. A refusal is recorded as
  `Indeterminate` and never re-asked, so a locked folder costs one probe rather
  than one per frame; a fresh listing resets every answer, so a refresh
  re-probes.
- The probe is a directory read on a child the caller is only *displaying*, so
  a source may decline it: the trait's default answers `NotImplemented`, which
  reads as `Indeterminate`. The trusted picker takes that default deliberately
  — the cue adds nothing to choosing a file — so it exercises no authority it
  does not need and its folders stay plain.

### Grid-view icon artwork

The grid draws each application's own icon, and the OS's shipped class masters
for everything else. The `Run` binary binds the renderer's `IconArtwork` lookup
to the shared artwork layer (`lib/icon::artwork`), so a tile shows the real
picture where one exists and the built-in vector glyph where it does not.
Resolution is therefore **total**: an absent, over-long, undecodable, or
disbelieved asset degrades to a glyph and never to a blank tile (`AGENTS.md`
§10, §2.9).

- **Where the assets come from.** For an application bundle, the icon its own
  signed `AppInfo` names inside its own `Resources/`; for everything else —
  and for a bundle that declares none, or whose icon will not serve — one
  `<asset-id>.png` or `<asset-id>.svg` per icon kind under
  `/System/Graphics/Icons` (`tairix_icon::icon_artwork_path`,
  `icon_vector_path`), the same store and the same spelling the
  desktop session resolves, not a file manager copy (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The
  kind comes from the one content-type registry
  (`media_for_entry(entry, parent).icon()`), so the artwork a name gets and the
  applications offered for it can never drift apart. A bundle's manifest is
  read at that boundary as untrusted input: bounded, decoded fail-closed, and
  its icon name accepted only as a plain file name resolved inside the
  bundle's own directory.
- **How the bytes are read.** Through the app's own capability-checked VFS read
  under the launching user's identity — no new authority — bounded to one byte
  past `tairix_icon::MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES`, so an over-long asset is *detected* as
  over-long rather than silently truncated into something that looks decodable.
  It is the same bounded open/read/close the bundle-manifest scan uses, with a
  different ceiling; there is no second copy of that loop.
- **How the pixels are produced — in a sandbox, never in the app.** Icon
  artwork is a file on a volume, i.e. untrusted input, so it is decoded by the
  shared `lib/sandbox` `imagerender` service running in a minimum-capability
  worker (`AGENTS.md` §19.5). The `Run` binary re-enters **itself** in the
  reserved worker role over a fresh pipe pair — the same production launcher
  pattern the desktop session uses (`ParserSandbox` over `RtLauncher`), not a
  second mechanism — and the kernel brands that child capability-empty and
  confines it to the sandbox syscall allow-list. Nothing is decoded in the file
  manager's own address space.
- **The reply is not trusted.** The worker's echoed side and exact pixel length
  are validated by the transport, and the shared cache re-checks the block is
  exactly `side`×`side` straight-alpha RGBA8 before a surface is built from it.
  A short, long, or refusing reply resolves to `None`, which draws the glyph.
- **The fallback chain, in order.** Shipped raster artwork → the shipped vector
  asset → the built-in vector
  glyph. Every failure along the way (asset missing, asset over-long, decode
  refused, worker crashed and was replaced, reply disbelieved) falls to the
  glyph, and the refusal itself is cached so a broken asset is not re-read every
  frame.
- **Only what is drawn is decoded.** The renderer asks the lookup for the
  visible tiles alone, at the exact `IconTile::icon_side` each tile reserves, so a
  hundred-entry directory costs one read and one decode per *visible kind* — not
  per entry — and scrolling decodes only the kinds that just came into view.
  Nothing pre-warms an icon for an entry that is scrolled out of sight.
- **And nothing is decoded on the event loop at all.** A tile that misses
  records the decode on the shared deferred-decode desk
  (`tairix_icon::ArtworkDesk` — the same policy the desktop session's worker
  thread drives) and draws its built-in glyph; the decode itself runs on the
  app's one reader thread, which owns its **own** sandbox child so no sandbox
  handle crosses a thread. So the first frame of a folder of picture-bearing
  bundles does not block on a sandbox round trip per tile, a scroll step does
  not block on the newly revealed row, and a key or a click waits on nothing.
  The reader nudges the loop once its artwork queue drains rather than after
  each icon, so the repaint is one whole-window pass per batch and the tiles
  appear together — a present is a round trip through the compositor and
  dearer than the decode that produced a single tile. A fresh round opens on
  every delivered event, which is what stops a decode the cache evicted from
  being answered "not yet" for ever. The lock carries only the desk: the cache
  stays on the paint side, because a picture is handed out as a borrow into it.
  The paint side is `userland/apps/files/src/icons.rs`, host-tested there —
  including the assertion that a paint performs no read and no sandbox call at
  all, and that a decode in flight is neither re-offered nor re-recorded.
  Where the kernel grants no reader thread the read and the round trip happen
  in the paint instead, exactly as they used to: slower under load, never
  wrong, and stated once.
- **The memory is governed and given back.** The cache is built through the one
  shared `tairix_icon::artwork_cache` constructor with the app's real seat,
  frame size, live pressure gauge, and audit sink, so it is classified and
  budgeted by the same reclaimable-memory policy the session's caches obey — no
  hand-picked numbers. The app adds the memory-pressure system notice to the
  wait-set it already parks on: it reads the band once before the first present
  (the member reports only *changes*, and the process gauge starts at the
  fail-closed unknown band, which admits nothing) and, on each pressure wake,
  re-reads the band and trims the cache at the wake itself. There is no
  timer and no poll. Dropping the pipeline tears the cache down, overwriting the
  artwork first, so the pixels are released on every way out of the app — a
  window close and a fail-loud exit alike.
- **No new capability.** Hosting the sandbox worker is an ordinary restricted
  spawn, and `files.app` already requests `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` for launching an
  activated bundle; the sandbox launch reuses that same authority and asks for
  nothing more. Decoding in-process to avoid the spawn would be the wrong trade
  and is not done.

The safety properties are host-proven in `lib/browse`'s tests with fakes for
both seams (no live sandbox): artwork reaching a tile, a missing asset and an
over-long asset each reproducing the glyph frame exactly with the decoder never
reached, a wrong-length reply refused without touching the frame, one decode
across a hundred tiles, a scroll decoding only the newly visible kind, and
`teardown` dropping the charged bytes to zero.

### The places / devices sidebar

The file manager draws a vertical shortcut rail down the leading edge of its
window. The model is `lib/browse`'s `places` module and it is **pure**: it is
handed the user's home path components and a list of volumes, and returns an
ordered, validated list. It never opens, stats, or lists anything, so it is
host-testable and cannot smuggle a read past the app's own capability-checked
seam.

**Order.** One deterministic order, so the rail never reshuffles between two
paints of the same state:

1. `Home`, `Desktop`, `Documents` — the user's own places, derived from their
   home components. They are always listed, whether or not the directories
   exist (the model does no I/O and cannot know); a shortcut that turns out to
   be missing fails closed on activation and says so.
2. `Apps`, `System` — the machine's application and system roots.
3. a separation, then the mounted volumes, sorted by label.

With no home components the three home-derived rows are dropped rather than
spelled as rows that navigate nowhere.

**Volumes come from the live mount table, and the medium is real data.** The
app reads the ungated `MOUNT_LIST` query through `lib/procinfo`'s
`for_each_mount`, keeps only mounts that are actually serving I/O, and passes
each one's label, target, and `MountRecord::medium()` to the model. The icon is
`tairix_icon::disk_icon(medium)`: rotational, solid-state, and removable each
get their own shipped artwork, and a paravirtual or unreported medium gets the
generic drive glyph — never a guessed classification.

**Malformed input is dropped, not repaired.** A volume whose label is empty,
longer than `MAX_PLACE_LABEL`, or carries a control character; whose target is
not an absolute path; or whose target duplicates a row already accepted (a
fixed place included) is left out. The mount table reports what the machine has
mounted, including text this process did not author, so it is validated rather
than trusted.

**Layout and paint go through the shared machinery.** `SidebarView`
(`lib/browse::layout`) is the one definition of the rail's geometry: its width
derived from the row's icon column plus the widest fixed label measured in the
active font plus the theme's padding (never a fixed pixel count, and clamped to
a third of the window), its per-row rectangles, the separator band, and the
`index_at` hit-test that inverts them exactly.

**A rail longer than the window scrolls.** The rows are laid out unscrolled at
their natural size (`row_rect`) and shown through a `ScrollView` (`view`), so a
machine with more volumes than the window has room for reaches every one of
them rather than losing the rows past its end. While `content_height` exceeds
the rail, a bar is carved from the rail's trailing edge (`bar_rect`) and the
rows take what is left (`rows_area`). `shown_row_rect` is the part of a row the
window shows, and `index_at` resolves a window point through the view, so a
row the edge cuts is hit on whatever part of it shows and a point on the bar is
no row. The paint draws only the rows `visible_range` names, found from the
offset rather than by walking the rows, so it costs what it draws however many
volumes are mounted. The offset lives on the rail's own `ScrollColumn`
(`Places::scroll`) —
the column the listing's bar is — so the two bars behave alike, and it is
clamped wherever it is read, so a rebuild onto a shorter rail cannot leave it
past the end.

**The command toolbar is window chrome, and the rail starts below it.**
`render::sidebar_view` lays the rail out in the window inset at the top by the
toolbar band and no taller than what is left, so the rail's first row top *is*
the first listing row's top and every rail row sits on the same `row_height`
grid as the
listing rows beside it. `render::toolbar_bounds` — and the three hit-tests that
invert it, `toolbar_command_at`, `manager_tool_at`, and `manager_tool_rect` —
take the **whole window**, because the band spans it edge to edge like the rest
of the desktop's chrome. `render::content_area` is what the
list/grid, the scrollbar, and every overlay drawn over the view occupy — the
window less the rail on the leading edge, full height — and is the rectangle
those entry points are hit-tested against, so a click resolves to the control
the user saw. With no rail it returns the window unchanged, so the trusted
picker's pixels and hit-tests are exactly as they were.

**Both bands are off when a window opens, and are the user's to turn on.** A
file manager window is the listing: `chrome::Chrome::HIDDEN` is what every
window starts on, so neither the rail nor the command strip reserves any of it.
`chrome::ToolbarBand` (`Shown` / `Hidden`) travels beside the
`Option<&Places>` that already said whether a rail is drawn, through every
measurement of the listing and every hit-test that inverts one — so
`chrome_height` is zero, `sidebar_view` starts the rail at the top of the
window, and `toolbar_bounds` yields **no** rectangle rather than a flat one.
That last point is the fail-closed one: the shared `Toolbar` lays its buttons
out from whatever origin it is given, so a zero-height band would have
resolved a press on the window's top row against a strip nothing painted
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4). A window showing no rail likewise routes nothing to one.

`F9` shows or hides the rail; `Ctrl+F9` the toolbar. They are what keeps every
command the strip carries reachable while it is hidden — the view toggle, the
sort cycle, and the Trash tools have no keyboard equivalent of their own —
until the desktop settings application sets the same two fields from the
user's stored preference. The picker is unaffected: `ManagerChrome::none()`
still carries `ToolbarBand::Shown`, and `picker::PICKER_CHROME` names that
once so the painted band and the hit-tests cannot disagree.

Rows are drawn with the shared `ListRow` control, which already carries the
artwork seam, so a volume shows its medium's artwork and falls back to the
built-in glyph. Every state the control offers is reachable: the pointer's row
hovers, the keyboard cursor's row is focused while the rail holds focus, the row
matching the browser's current location is *selected* through the control's own
selection state (an exact component match — standing inside a place is not
standing on it), and a row whose navigation was refused reads *disabled*.

**Input.** A primary press on a row focuses the rail, moves its cursor there,
and navigates. A press on the rail's bar, the drag that follows it, and a wheel
turn while the pointer is over the rail scroll the rail and never the listing
(`render::sidebar_scroll_pointer`, `sidebar_scroll_wheel`). The window records
where every pointer event puts the pointer, whether or not it draws a rail,
because a wheel turn carries no position of its own. `Tab` moves focus between
the rail and the file view from either side; while the rail holds focus the
up/down arrows move its cursor and scroll the least that shows it whole
(`sidebar_reveal`), `Enter` activates, and `Escape` hands focus back. Every
other key is swallowed rather than navigating the listing behind the rail —
except the window's accelerators (`chrome::Accelerator`: `Alt+←/→/↑`, `F5`,
`Ctrl+Shift+N`), which act on the window whichever field holds the keyboard
and run through the same dispatch as their toolbar controls. A place that
cannot be listed leaves the browser exactly where it was, states the reason on
`stderr`, and marks the row unavailable so it reads disabled from then on — it
never wedges or blanks the window.

**The lit row follows the rows.** Every round that moves the rows under a
still pointer — a wheel turn, a drag, an arrow that scrolls — lights the row
now under the pointer. A change no round describes — a rebuilt rail, a toggled
band, a resize, a re-theme — is presented whole, and the whole repaint finds
the row again (`sidebar::follow_pointer`); a window drawing no rail lights
none.

**Attach and removal.** The volume rows converge on the kernel's mount-change
notice: the manager holds a `Mounts` wait-set member, and an attach, a
re-backing, or a removal wakes it. The rebuild happens off the event loop —
what is mounted comes from the System Information service, so reading it on the
loop would stall a frame — and every window's rail is redrawn when the answer
lands. There is no polling loop and nothing spins waiting for a mount; the
keyboard focus, the cursor and the scroll survive the rebuild.

**Refresh.** `F5`, or the toolbar's Refresh command, re-reads the rail in the
same gesture that re-lists the directory. The rail is asked of the same reader
and lands through the same path as a mount notice's read, in every window, so
the gesture never stalls a frame on the System Information service. An attach
or a removal needs no gesture.

**The trusted picker draws no rail.** `render` takes the manager chrome —
write tools plus the optional rail — as one `ManagerChrome` value, and the
picker passes `ManagerChrome::none()`. That is deliberate: the picker is a
read-only chooser bounded to the tree the requesting application was authorised
to be shown, and one-click jumps to arbitrary mounted volumes would widen the
pick beyond what was asked for.

### The `Run` bundle

`files.app`'s entry point (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3) wires `VfsDirectorySource`
over `tairix_rt::read_dir_all`, creates and grants the zero-copy window
frame region, parks on its window-event mailbox, and drives the browser
with the keyboard (`Down`/`Up` select, `Enter` activates the selection —
descending into a directory or launching a selected `<Name>.app` bundle
(spawning its own `Run` through the signed load gate, async, the launched
child reaped on the wait-set's any-child member; see *Activating an entry*),
`Backspace` climbs, `F2` renames the selected item, `Ctrl+Shift+N` makes a new
folder, and the toolbar accelerators `Alt+←/→/↑` and `F5`) and the pointer: a
primary-button press first checks the manager-only write tools
(`render::manager_tool_at` → New Folder), then the read-only command toolbar
(`render::toolbar_command_at` → the shared `apply_command`, so a click on a
disabled tool does nothing), and a press on an item selects
it (`Browser::select`) — the GUI is a spelling of the user's
intent, never an escalation, so a refused re-listing leaves the browser exactly
where it was. A `CloseRequested` from the desktop ends it cleanly, and every
bring-up refusal exits fail-loud with its reason on `stderr`. It opens at the
directory named as its first argument — the operand validated fail-closed
before any syscall, a refusal stated on `stderr` and degraded to the launching
user's home directory and then the root view, so a bad argument never leaves
the user without a window — or at that home directory when no argument is
given. The autostarted file manager takes the first slot on the taskbar's
application strip and opens a window on demand (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T4).

### In-place rename

`F2` renames the selected item in place. The *edit* is modelled in
`lib/browse` (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM5) so it is host-tested without a
kernel; the `Run` binary supplies only the text editor and the `fs_rename`
seam. Pressing `F2` opens the one shared `lib/controls` `TextField`
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2 — never a browser-private text box) directly over the
selected item's **name** — the list row's name cell, past its icon and well
short of the size and date columns, or the tile's label band under its
picture — pre-filled with the current name and bounded by the kernel's
`FS_NAME_MAX`. That rectangle is `render::selection_name_rect`, read from the
drawn controls' own geometry (`TableRow::cell_text_rect`,
`IconTile::label_rect`), so the field lands on the text it is editing and
cannot drift from where the renderer put it. Typing edits the name and live-validates it: a name that
breaks a rule or clashes with an existing sibling shows the reason in the
field as you type. `Enter` commits and `Escape` abandons the edit.

The typed name is spelled through the one shared `tairix_path::validate_file_name`
rule (the same rule the browser's path components go through, `AGENTS.md`
§2.2): non-empty, not `.`/`..`, no `/`, no control character or `:`, within
the name bound. A rename to the current name is a no-op that touches neither
the VFS nor the view. A commit that survives validation is applied by
`Browser::rename_selected`, which builds the two absolute paths and calls
`fs_rename` **under the launching user's own identity — no new capability**:
the per-inode owner/mode/ACL model gates the write exactly as it would from
the shell. The whole operation is transactional and fail-closed — the name
is validated before any syscall, and a VFS refusal (a permission denial, a
read-only mount, a lost race) leaves the listing untouched and states the
kernel's reason in the field (`AGENTS.md` §2.24, §5.4), never a silent or
fabricated success. On success the directory is re-listed and the selection
follows the entry to its new name. The trusted file picker composes the same
`Browser` and simply never calls the write path, so it stays read-only
(`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6).

### The trusted picker opens at the user's home

The desktop session's trusted file picker (the CU6 delegation UI,
`plans/APPWIN.md` AW5) opens at the logged-in user's home rather than the
storage-forest root: the session reads its `HOME` environment (exported by
login), parses it through the shared `vfs::components_from_absolute_path`, and
`open_at`s the picker's `Browser` there, falling back to `/` when `HOME` is
unset or a pick-time listing of it is refused (fail closed, never a guessed
path). So the user lands among their own files, one click from a document,
instead of drilling down from `/` every time — and the read-only picker still
composes the exact same `Browser` (it only chose a different starting
directory, `AGENTS.md` §2.2).

Opening a file into a viewer through this picker works as follows
(`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM9-b): the session launches `view`, which (handed
no document) asks the picker, the picker opens at `/Users/root`, a click on the
planted document row concludes the pick, and the session delegates the chosen
file to `view` through the CU6 one-shot `fd_grant` / `fd_redeem` — `view` then
reads exactly that one file with no filesystem capability of its own.

**Coverage: host-proven and guest-proven.** The kernel delegation path (mint,
the instance gate, one-shot redemption, the grantor-identity re-check) and the
picker's own model are unit-tested on the host, and the
`filepick-qemu-aarch64` vertical drives the whole click-through on a running
kernel: it launches `view` from the program library, waits for the session's
own `PICKER_SHOWN` record, clicks the planted document's row, and passes only
on a `SyscallInvoked` `sc=fd_grant` from `comm=desktop` followed by
`sc=fd_redeem` from `comm=view`. The planted document is a text file, which a
picture viewer states it cannot draw — the claim the run makes is which
principal delegated to which, and a refusal reads it just as a render would.

Its sibling, the `handover-qemu-aarch64` vertical, drives the **three**-principal
route the file manager uses (`plans/VIEW.md`): with `view` already running and
holding no window, activating a planted picture in a file-manager window makes
the *manager* open the file under the user's identity and mint a delegation for
it *to the session*, the session redeem that delegation and grant the same
authority on to the live instance, and the viewer redeem what arrives and open
a window for it. Its PASS is two complete relays of `comm=files sc=fd_grant`,
`comm=desktop sc=fd_redeem`, `comm=desktop sc=fd_grant`, `comm=view
sc=fd_redeem` in that order, the viewer's two redeems required to come from the
same kernel-attested task — so one process took both documents and opened a
window for each, which is the single-instance funnel doing its job rather than
a second viewer being started. Each latched step prints its own marker, so a
failing run names the hop that was missing.

The activation is the item's own context-menu *Open* row, which runs the
manager's same `activate`: two single presses, each gated on a witness the
emitting side states for itself, where the drawn plate is the only statement
anywhere that the press reached an entry — no audit record names a pointer
action. The *double-click* path to `activate` is host-tested where it is
decided rather than stated by this run (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D132).

Attributing each half to the principal the kernel says made the call is what
makes the run a statement about a hand-off *between* two processes rather than
about one process touching its own descriptor, and requiring that order rules
out a redemption that could not have come from this pick. Removing the
pick-click makes the run fail with the Viewer launched and the picker on screen
but no delegation at all, so the witness is caused by the gesture rather than by
the launch.

The pick-click waits on `PICKER_SHOWN` because nothing earlier is honest: the
picker is a window the session owns, so the window channel says nothing about
its pixels; the requesting application learns only that its `PickFile` was
*accepted*; and the listing is read on a worker, so acceptance is not yet a row
to click.

### Multi-selection and the clipboard model

The management verbs — cut, copy, move, delete — act on a *set* of entries,
not just the focus cursor. That set and the cut/copy clipboard are modelled
purely in `lib/browse` (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7), host-tested without a
kernel exactly as the rename and activation models are; the app-side verbs
that execute a plan (the `fs_rename` / streamed copy / `fs_unlink`) ride on top
of it in a later increment.

`select::Selection` is the per-listing set of marked entries plus the anchor a
range extension grows from. `Browser` drives it with the familiar gestures: a
plain click or unmodified keyboard move selects one entry (`select`), a
`Ctrl`-click toggles one (`toggle_selection`), a `Shift`-click selects the
contiguous range from the anchor (`extend_selection_to`), and Select All
(`select_all`) marks everything; each bounds-checks its index against the live
listing and fails closed (`BrowseError::NoSuchEntry`) rather than marking a
phantom row. Because the members are indices into the current listing, any
listing change — a navigation, a refresh, or a re-sort — collapses the
selection back to the single focused entry, so it can never point at a stale
row.

`Browser::clipboard(op)` captures the selected entries' absolute component
paths onto a `clipboard::Clipboard` for a `Copy` or a `Cut` (`None` when
nothing is selected, so "paste" is simply unavailable rather than a silent
no-op). Because it holds absolute paths, the clipboard stays valid after the
user navigates to the directory they want to paste into. `plan_paste(clipboard,
target)` then resolves each source to a destination under the target directory
and is **fail closed** (`AGENTS.md` §5.4): a target that is one of the moved
items or lies inside it is refused as `PasteError::WouldRecurse` — an exact
root-first component-prefix test, so `/a/b` is inside `/a` but `/ab` is not —
and a paste back into an item's own directory is not silently applied but
flagged (`PasteItem::overwrites_source`) for the app to confirm or to give the
copy a new name (`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The engine only names *what* would move
where and *why a paste is refused*; the app performs the capability-checked
`fs_rename` / streamed copy under the launching user's own identity, so
composing the model grants no authority and the trusted picker never builds a
clipboard.

Given a `plan_paste` result, `execute::paste_strategy(op, source, dest)` decides
*how* each item is carried out from the clipboard operation and the two items'
`execute::VolumeId`s (the 16-byte `fs_stat` volume identity): a `Copy` always
streams, a `Cut` within one volume is a single `Rename`, and a `Cut` across
volumes is a `CopyThenDelete` — the same `st_dev` decision `mv` makes, in one
place (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). A streamed copy runs through an `execute::CopyCursor`:
it walks a known-length source in fixed `execute::COPY_CHUNK_LEN` steps,
yielding the next `execute::CopyChunk` for the app to read and write, then
`advance`s by the bytes actually carried — so a large copy holds no unbounded
buffer and never spins (`AGENTS.md` §2.23), stays cancellable between chunks,
and `resume`s from a persisted offset after a cancel or a preemption. It is
fail closed: advancing or resuming past the source length is
`execute::CopyError::Overrun` rather than a silent wrap (`AGENTS.md` §5.4), and
the source of a cross-volume move is removed only once its copy has fully
succeeded, so a failed copy loses no data. The engine does no I/O; the app
performs every `fs_rename` / `fs_read` / `fs_write` / `fs_unlink` under the
launching user's own identity, so the read-only picker never runs it.

Where an `execute::CopyCursor` streams one *file*, an `execute::CopyWalk` copies
a whole *tree* — the copy-side analogue of the delete-side `delete::DeleteWalk`.
Where a delete removes a directory's contents *before* the directory, a copy
*creates* the destination directory *before* streaming its contents into it, so
a child always has a parent to land in. `CopyWalk::from_items` begins the walk
from the resolved `(source, dest, is_directory)` items — the app supplies each
item's kind, which the path-only clipboard does not carry — and is fail closed:
an empty set, or a source or destination naming the root, yields no walk
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4). `CopyWalk::next_action` yields the next `execute::CopyAction`
— `MakeDir { dest }` (the app `fs_mkdir`s the destination directory and reports
`CopyWalk::created`), `List { source }` (the app reads the source with
`fs_readdir` and reports its children with `CopyWalk::expand`), or
`CopyFile { source, dest }` (the app streams the bytes with a `CopyCursor` and
reports `CopyWalk::copied_file`). It keeps its own explicit stack rather than
recursing on the call stack, so a deeply nested tree cannot overflow it, and it
is bounded by `execute::MAX_COPY_DEPTH` — the same `MAX_WALK_DEPTH` fail-closed
recursion bound `DeleteWalk` obeys, held in one place so the two walks cannot
disagree (`AGENTS.md` §2.2, §26.6). It holds its exact position between steps, so
the app may cancel or be preempted and resume without repeating or skipping work
(`AGENTS.md` §2.23); a deeper tree is `CopyWalkError::TooDeep` and driving it
against the wrong step is `CopyWalkError::OutOfStep`, both leaving the walk
unchanged. `CopyWalk::copied` is the honest rising count a progress indicator
shows; the total is unknown until the reads reveal it, so nothing fabricates a
percentage. The engine does no I/O; the app performs every syscall under the
launching user's own identity, so the read-only picker never runs a walk.

### The delete model

Deleting the selection (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b) is modelled purely in
`lib/browse::delete` plus `Browser::plan_delete`, host-proven ahead of the app's
Delete verb exactly as the clipboard and paste-execution models are.
`Browser::plan_delete()` captures the current multi-selection into a
`delete::DeletePlan` (`None` when nothing is selected), one `delete::DeleteTarget`
per marked entry in listing order. Each target carries the entry's absolute
component path — so it names exactly the node the browser shows and can never
resolve to a different one (`AGENTS.md` §2.2) — and whether it is
directory-backed on disk: a directory *or* a sealed `<Name>.app` bundle, since
either is removed with `UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY` and recursed into as the
directory it really is, while a regular file is a leaf. `DeletePlan::new` is
fail closed: an empty selection, or any target naming the filesystem root (an
empty component list), yields no plan rather than one that could remove nothing
or the root itself (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). `DeletePlan::len` and
`DeletePlan::has_directories` are the honest figures a delete confirmation
reports — the count, and whether folders (and their contents) are among the
removals — so the app's `lib/controls` `Dialog` warns truthfully rather than
treating every deletion as a single file (`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The model names
*what* would be removed; the app performs each `fs_unlink` under the launching
user's own identity — an ordinary permission-checked VFS call, no new
capability — so composing the model grants nothing and the read-only picker
never builds a delete plan.

Where the `DeletePlan` names *what* would be removed, `delete::DeleteWalk`
models *how* — the depth-first recursive removal that clears a directory's
contents before the directory itself. It is the delete-side analogue of the
paste-side `execute::CopyCursor`: a pure, host-provable driven cursor that
touches no filesystem. `DeleteWalk::from_plan` begins the walk and
`DeleteWalk::next_action` yields the next `delete::DeleteAction` — `List(path)`
(the app reads that directory with `fs_readdir` and reports its children with
`DeleteWalk::expand`, so they are removed first) or
`Remove { path, is_directory }` (the app unlinks the leaf file, or the
already-emptied directory with `UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY`, and reports it with
`DeleteWalk::complete_removal`). The walk keeps its own explicit stack rather
than recursing on the call stack, so a deeply nested tree cannot overflow it,
and it is bounded by `delete::MAX_DELETE_DEPTH` (a fail-closed defence, not a
scaled capacity — a tree deeper than the bound is `DeleteError::TooDeep`, never
descended without limit, `AGENTS.md` §26.6, §24.4). It holds its exact position
between steps, so the app may cancel or be preempted between any two steps and
resume without repeating or skipping work — no unbounded buffer and no spin
(`AGENTS.md` §2.23). Driving it against the wrong step (an `expand` on a leaf,
or a `complete_removal` on a directory not yet listed) is
`DeleteError::OutOfStep` and leaves the walk unchanged. `DeleteWalk::removed` is
the honest rising count a progress indicator shows; the total is unknown until
the reads reveal it, so nothing fabricates a percentage. This is the browser
engine's own component-path traversal, deliberately distinct from `rm`'s
coreutils removal engine (which recurses natively over its own raw-path removal
seam with prompt/force/verbose semantics) — two consumers with two data models,
not one algorithm copied twice (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The engine does no I/O; the
app performs every read and unlink under the launching user's own identity, so
the read-only picker never runs a walk.

The Delete verb is wired in the `files.app` `Run` binary. Pressing `Delete` on
a selection opens a modal confirmation `lib/controls` `Dialog`, built by the
shared `render::build_delete_dialog` from the captured `DeletePlan`: the title
names a single target or reports the honest count, and the message warns that
folders (and their contents) are removed when the plan includes a directory
(`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The honest Action Warmth sits on the safe **Cancel**
(recommended), never on the destructive **Delete**. `render::delete_dialog_rect`
centres and clamps the dialog to the window and `render::delete_dialog_action_at`
mirrors its button geometry so a click resolves to exactly the button pressed
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2); `Escape` (or Cancel) dismisses it, `Enter` (or Delete)
confirms. On confirm a *recoverable* removal is a move to Trash (the
move-to-Trash section below); this paragraph describes the *permanent* removal
the app falls back to when Trash is unavailable or cross-volume. It drives a
`DeleteWalk` to completion — reading each
directory with the same capability-checked listing call and shared decode the
browser navigates with, and `fs_unlink`-ing each node depth-first (with
`UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY` for a directory-backed target) under the launching
user's own identity, no new capability. The removal is bounded and fail closed:
the first refused read or unlink stops it, states the reason on `stderr` (fail
loud, `AGENTS.md` §2.24), and leaves whatever was already removed removed rather
than a fabricated success; the view is then re-listed so a partial removal is
shown honestly (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). Only the file manager builds and drives this
— the read-only picker never deletes.

A long removal — and a long copy/paste — shows **progress** and can be
**cancelled**. Rather than driving the walk to completion in one blocking pass,
the confirmed operation is handed to an *interleaved operation* the event loop
advances a bounded slice at a time (`advance_operation`, up to
`OPERATION_STEP_BUDGET` units of work per turn — one directory read, one unlink,
one `fs_mkdir`, one copy chunk, or one rename): between slices it repaints a
modal progress panel and polls the event mailbox *non-blocking* for a mid-run
cancel or a close, so even a large recursive delete or a multi-gigabyte copy
never freezes the window and never busy-spins — continuously stepping the walk
is genuine pending work, not a spin (`AGENTS.md` §2.23). A single `Operation`
carries either a `DeleteWalk` (a delete) or a `Paste` state machine (a
copy/move), so both drive through one interleaving path (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The
panel is the shared `lib/browse::progress` model (`ProgressModel` — the
operation kind, the honest rising `DeleteWalk::removed` / paste-node count, and
a *latched* cancel) drawn by `render::draw_progress_dialog` as a `lib/controls`
`Panel`, an indeterminate `Progress` "working" trace (no fabricated percentage,
since the total is unknown until the reads reveal it, `AGENTS.md` §2.24), and a
Cancel `Button`; `render::progress_cancel_at` mirrors the button geometry so a
click resolves to exactly the drawn Cancel (fail closed off it, `AGENTS.md`
§2.2, §5.4). The app's modal routing lives in the host-testable
`userland/apps/files/src/operation.rs`, which takes the window plus the drawn
places rail and derives the panel's rect through the same `content_area` the
panel is painted in, so the drawn button and the clickable button cannot drift
apart by the rail's width and a caller cannot hand the routing the wrong
rectangle. A cancel is latched and stops the walk at the next unit boundary —
never mid-node, and never mid-chunk — and a completed or cancelled/refused run
alike re-lists so what actually remains is shown honestly. A cross-volume move's
source-removal cleanup runs as a `Deleting` stage of the same interleaved
`Paste`, over the shared delete walk, so a move's cleanup and an interactive
delete share one removal definition (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

### The move-to-Trash model

A delete should be reversible when that costs nothing (`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The
`lib/browse::trash` model (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM10) is the pure decision
behind that recoverable delete, host-proven ahead of the app wiring exactly as
the delete and paste-execution models landed ahead of their verbs.
`trash_strategy` decides, from the item's and the user's Trash directory's
`execute::VolumeId`s, whether the removal can be a cheap `TrashStrategy::Move` —
a single same-volume `fs_rename` that carries the item into Trash intact,
recoverable until the user empties it — or must fall back to the irreversible
`TrashStrategy::Unlink`, the existing `DeleteWalk` path, when the item lives on
a different volume from Trash (a rename cannot span a volume boundary, exactly
as `mv` decides from `st_dev`). It is the same volume identity
`execute::paste_strategy` compares, so the two decisions share one definition
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). `trash_dest_path` resolves a collision-free home *inside*
the Trash directory: the original leaf name when it is free, otherwise the
smallest ` (n)` disambiguation inserted before the extension (`notes (2).txt`),
reusing the one shared `icon` extension split so a disambiguation lands before
the same extension the icon and "Open With…" classifiers recognise. It never
overwrites an existing trashed item (`AGENTS.md` §2.24) and is fail closed: it
refuses a Trash directory that names the root (`RootTrash`), an invalid original
name (`InvalidName`), a disambiguation past the per-name length limit
(`TooLong`), and a search that exhausts the fixed `MAX_TRASH_NAME_ATTEMPTS`
bound (`NoFreeName`, `AGENTS.md` §5.4, §24.4). The model touches no filesystem
and holds no authority — the app performs the `fs_stat`/`fs_rename` under the
launching user's own identity, no new capability — so composing it grants
nothing and the read-only picker never runs it.

The **move-to-Trash verb** (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM10b) is wired into the
confirmed-delete path in the `files.app` `Run` binary. Because a selection lives
in one directory — hence on one volume — a whole delete plan is uniform, so the
app decides one disposition for it *before* showing the confirmation, and the
dialog's wording matches exactly what a confirmed delete will do (`AGENTS.md`
§2.24). `begin_delete` resolves the user's home from the `HOME` the session
exported (the same source the trusted picker starts at), spells the fixed
`Library/Trash` subtree with the shared `trash::trash_dir` (one definition, so
the app and its QEMU witness agree on where a trashed item lands, `AGENTS.md`
§2.2), ensures that directory exists (`fs_mkdir` of `Library` then `Trash` under
the user's own identity), and — when the Trash and every target share a volume —
resolves each target's collision-free `trash_dest_path`. If all of that holds
the removal is a recoverable **move to Trash**: `render::build_delete_dialog` is
built with `trash::DeleteDisposition::Trash` (a safe, recommended *Move to
Trash* action and a "you can restore them" message), and on confirm the app
drives a `Job::Trash` operation that renames each target into its captured Trash
destination — one `fs_rename` per item through the same interleaved
progress/cancel runner as a delete or paste (`ProgressOp::Trash`), so even a
large selection stays responsive and cancellable (`AGENTS.md` §2.23). Anything
that makes the move impossible — an unset or root `HOME`, a Trash directory that
cannot be created or stat'd, or a cross-volume target (a mounted volume under
the current directory) — falls back, fail closed, to the irreversible
`DeleteWalk` unlink, and the dialog is built with `DeleteDisposition::Permanent`
(the destructive *Delete Permanently* action and the "cannot be undone"
warning), so the user is never promised a recovery the removal will not honour.
Every step is the launching user's own §5.3-checked call — **no new
capability**, no ambient authority.

The **empty-Trash model** (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM11a) is the irreversible
counterpart of the move above — now that the move fills the Trash, permanently
emptying it is no longer speculative surface (`AGENTS.md` §2.4).
`trash::empty_trash_plan` turns an `fs_readdir` of the Trash directory into a
`delete::DeletePlan` over its *contents* — never the Trash directory itself, so
emptying leaves the now-empty folder in place — carried out by the same
recursive `DeleteWalk` a permanent delete already uses, so there is no second
removal engine (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). Emptying is always permanent, so the app
confirms it with `DeleteDisposition::Permanent`. It returns nothing to do for an
already-empty Trash (a no-op the app simply does not offer, not an error) and is
fail closed: a root Trash directory (`RootTrash`) or an invalid child leaf
(`InvalidName`) refuses the whole empty rather than remove outside Trash or
silently skip an item (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). Like the move, it touches no
filesystem and holds no authority — the app drives the plan with its own
`fs_readdir`/`fs_unlink` under the launching user's identity — so composing it
grants nothing and the read-only picker never builds one.

The **empty-Trash verb and the Trash view** (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM11b)
are wired into the `files.app` `Run` binary through two manager-only toolbar
tools (see the frame model above), which the file manager hands to `render` and
the read-only picker never draws. **Go to Trash** (`ManagerTool::Trash`) is the
navigable Trash location: it resolves the user's home from `HOME`, ensures the
`Library/Trash` subtree exists (the shared `trash::trash_dir`, one definition,
`AGENTS.md` §2.2), and navigates the browser there with `Browser::navigate_to`
so the Trash's contents are shown like any other directory. **Empty Trash**
(`ManagerTool::EmptyTrash`) renders disabled — muted, never hidden — unless the
current directory *is* the user's Trash and it is non-empty (a `ManagerToolModel`
the app computes from `HOME`, since the engine does not know it); when it is
enabled, clicking it re-reads the Trash, builds `trash::empty_trash_plan`,
confirms it with the `DeleteDisposition::Permanent` dialog, and — on confirm —
drives the plan's `DeleteWalk` through the same interleaved progress/cancel
runner an ordinary delete uses (`ProgressOp::Delete`), under the launching
user's own `fs_readdir`/`fs_unlink` (no new capability). A stale click recomputes
the Trash location and refuses to empty anything else (fail closed, `AGENTS.md`
§5.4).

The whole empty-Trash flow is proven end to end on the production desktop by
the autoload QEMU vertical (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM11c, appended after
FM10's move-to-Trash delete): the runner clicks **Go to Trash** to navigate the
front files window into `Library/Trash` (now holding the trashed folder),
clicks **Empty Trash** to open the *Delete Permanently* confirmation, and
clicks its Delete button — every point reconstructed from the app's own layout
code (`render::manager_tool_rect` over the whole window for the tools;
`trash::empty_trash_plan` → `render::build_delete_dialog` with
`DeleteDisposition::Permanent` → `Dialog::action_rects` for the confirm button,
the same code the guest paints and hit-tests with, `AGENTS.md` §2.2). The
guest's PASS gate latches on the kernel's own `FsNodeMutated op=rmdir` audit
record whose target is under
`Library/Trash`, observed only after the FM10 move has latched, so no earlier
removal can satisfy it (fail closed). The empty burst is held behind a one-shot
serial marker the test kernel emits the first time it observes the move latch,
so the clicks land only once the folder is provably in the Trash and Empty
Trash is enabled.

For the file manager to find the user's Trash, the desktop session hands its
launched apps the **user environment** login exported. Plain `spawn` gives a
child an empty environment; the session's `spawn_app` helper instead launches
the file manager, terminal, and viewer with `spawn_with`, forwarding its own
environment (so `HOME`, `LANG`, … are inherited exactly as a login shell's
children inherit them) under the session's attested credential and console —
the environment is data and carries no authority (`AGENTS.md` §4, §5.4).

### The cut / copy / paste verbs

The clipboard verbs (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b) are wired in the
`files.app` `Run` binary on top of the FM7a/FM7b engine models above. The app
holds one `clipboard::Clipboard` in its overlay state, captured by
**`Ctrl+X`** (a move clipboard) or **`Ctrl+C`** (a copy clipboard) from the
current selection (`Browser::clipboard(op)`); with nothing selected the verb is
simply unavailable (fail closed). Because the clipboard holds absolute paths it
survives navigating to the paste target. **`Ctrl+V`** pastes it into the
current directory: `plan_paste` validates the plan (a paste of a folder into
itself is refused outright and nothing is enqueued), the app stats the
destination directory for its `execute::VolumeId`, and hands the plan to an
interleaved `Paste` operation the event loop then carries out a bounded slice at
a time (see the progress + cancel description above), so a large copy never
freezes the window. Every item runs under the launching user's own identity —
**no new capability**, every operation an ordinary §5.3-checked VFS call the
user could perform themselves. `execute::paste_strategy` chooses the mechanism
per item from the two nodes' volume ids: a same-volume move is one `fs_rename`,
a cross-volume move is copy-then-delete (the source removed through the shared
delete walk, as a `Deleting` stage of the same interleaved `Paste`, only once
its copy has fully succeeded), and a copy streams — a single file through an
`execute::CopyCursor` and a directory (or sealed `.app` bundle) through an
`execute::CopyWalk`, both driven over `fs_read`/`fs_write`/`fs_mkdir`/`fs_readdir`
with one reused, fixed-size (`FS_IO_MAX`) buffer so a copy of any size holds no
unbounded buffer and never spins (`AGENTS.md` §2.23, §26.6). It is bounded and
fail closed: the first refused operation stops the paste, states the reason on
`stderr` naming the item (fail loud, `AGENTS.md` §2.24), and leaves whatever
already landed in place rather than a fabricated success (`AGENTS.md` §5.4); the
view is then re-listed so a partial paste is shown honestly. Initiating a `Cut`
paste clears the clipboard (its sources are being moved, so re-pasting the same
cut would name items that are gone); a `Copy` keeps it for another paste. A
destination is created **exclusively**, so a pre-existing item of the same name
is refused rather than clobbered, and a `Copy` back into an item's own directory
is refused rather than silently duplicating a file onto itself (`AGENTS.md`
§2.24) — overwrite/merge confirmation is a separately-staged follow-up. Only the
file manager builds and drives this; the read-only picker never pastes.

### The new-folder model

Creating a folder (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b) is modelled purely in
`lib/browse::mkdir` plus `Browser::create_directory`, host-proven ahead of the
drawn New Folder tool exactly as the rename model landed ahead of its editor.
`validate_new_dir_name` spells the typed name through the one shared
`tairix_path::validate_file_name` rule — the same rule the rename editor and
every path component obey (`AGENTS.md` §2.2) — and refuses a name a sibling
already carries (`MkdirError::Clash`); both are decided *before* any syscall,
so a rejected name touches neither the VFS nor the view.
`Browser::create_directory` spells the new folder's absolute path through the
same shared `spell_child` the launch/open targets use, so the create can never
name a different node than the browser shows, then applies it through an
injected `fs_mkdir` seam under the launching user's own identity — an ordinary
permission-checked VFS call, no new capability (`AGENTS.md` §4, §5.3). It is
transactional and fail closed: a VFS refusal (a read-only mount, the user
cannot write the parent, a lost race) leaves the listing exactly as it was and
is surfaced as `MkdirError::Refused` for an honest in-UI answer (`AGENTS.md`
§2.24, §5.4). On success the directory is re-listed and the selection follows
onto the new folder, ready for the app to open its inline rename editor over
it. The model reads nothing and holds no authority, so the trusted picker
composes the same `Browser` and never calls the write path.

The drawn tool is wired (see the frame model above): New Folder is a
manager-only `chrome::ManagerTool` the file manager hands to `render` (the
picker does not), reachable by clicking the toolbar tool or pressing
`Ctrl+Shift+N`. The `Run` binary names a non-clashing placeholder with
`mkdir::suggest_new_dir_name`, creates it through `Browser::create_directory`,
and opens the inline rename on the new folder so the user names it at once.

The whole New-Folder + inline-rename flow is proven end to end on the
production desktop by the autoload QEMU vertical
(`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM9-a, appended after the AW4 terminal round
trip): the runner refocuses the served files window, descends into
`/Users/root` by coordinate-computed pointer clicks — reconstructing the
browser's own row layout through `render::entry_rect` over the real
listings and the New Folder tool through `render::manager_tool_rect` over the
whole window (the band the toolbar is drawn across), the same layout code the
guest paints with, offset by the window manager's client inset
(`WindowFrame::insets`) so a click lands on the client, not the decoration
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2) — and seat-keyboard `Enter`s, clicks the New Folder tool,
and types a distinct name. The guest's PASS gate latches on the kernel's own
`FsNodeMutated` audit records — `op=mkdir` then `op=rename`, observed after the
terminal round trip so no boot- or login-time directory creation can satisfy
them — so the mkdir and the rename are kernel-attested, under the logged-in
user's own identity, and a refused mutation (`FsMutationDenied`) can never
count (fail closed).

The **confirm-and-remove** flow (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM9-c) is reached
by right-clicking the selection and choosing **Delete**, which runs the same
`begin_delete` → confirm-dialog → `DeleteWalk` path the `Delete` key drives.
Making the right-click reach the app required a compositor fix that makes the
*whole* context menu usable in the desktop: secondary (right) button presses
were being dropped, so `tairix_wm`'s input router now raises+focuses and
delivers a client-area right-press as `InputResponse::SecondaryActivated`, the
desktop session's router forwards it to the window manager, and the session
delivers `WindowEvent::Pointer` `Pressed(Secondary)` to the app — host-tested
in `tairix-wm` and `tairix-desktop-session`.

The earlier note that a scripted right-click "never arrives in the guest" was a
test-harness bug, not an emulator limit, and is now fixed and proven. QEMU's
HMP `mouse_button` help string ("1=L, 2=M, 4=R") is wrong: `hmp_mouse_button`
maps state bit `0x2` to the right button and `0x4` to the middle (the legacy
`MOUSE_EVENT_*` `bmap`). The QEMU test harness (`tools/qemu`) had trusted the
help string and sent a secondary press as bit `0x4`, so QEMU delivered a
*middle*-button event and no OS layer ever saw a right-click.
`MouseButton::mask_bit` now sends `0x2` for the secondary button, and a
dedicated aarch64 vertical
(`tairix-test-pointer-button-virtio-mmio-qemu-aarch64`) proves it: it attaches
a `virtio-mouse-device`, injects a secondary press+release, and asserts the
driver decodes `BTN_RIGHT` (`0x111`), never the middle button (`0x112`) — it
times out with the old mask and passes with the fix.

**No QEMU vertical clicks the file manager's context menu.** The plates are the
desktop's now, so a script that aimed at one would reconstruct the *session's*
chain rather than the app's layout — and the session's chain is already driven
end to end by `tests/integration/menu_qemu_aarch64`, which opens a menu, waits
for the `MENU_SHOWN` record that says a plate actually reached the display,
photographs the plate at the rectangle the production chain reports, and clicks
one of its rows. What is left unproven by a host test in the file manager's own
case is the glue that sends the open and matches the answer's id, which is the
same shape that vertical already exercises for the terminal.

### The properties model

The Properties panel (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM8) shows one selected node's
metadata. That view is modelled purely in `lib/browse::properties`, host-tested
without a kernel exactly as the rename, activation, and clipboard models are;
the drawn panel that paints it is described below.

`Properties::from_stat(name, kind, stat)` turns an entry's name, its browser
`EntryKind`, and the `fs_stat` `FileStat` the app read for it into the
display-ready fields the panel renders: a human kind label (`Folder` / `File` /
`Application` — the `EntryKind` distinguishes a sealed `<Name>.app` bundle from
an ordinary directory — or, for a symbolic link, `Alias to folder` / `Alias to
file` / `Alias to application`, and `Broken alias` when it names nothing
reachable, with `with_target` attaching the spelling the link stores so the
panel can show where it points), the apparent `size` and on-disk `allocated` bytes (both
via the shared `format_size`, never one derived from the other), the raw mode
and its four-digit octal spelling, the ten-character permission string
(`drwxr-xr-x`), the owning uid/gid, and the four `Time64` stamps rendered as
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` through `format_datetime`. Every field comes straight
from `fs_stat`; a stamp the backing does not keep is `Time64::UNIX_EPOCH`,
which renders blank rather than as a fabricated `1970-01-01` wall time
(`AGENTS.md` §21). The permission string is the one shared
`tairix_abi::fs::mode_string` spelling — the same definition `ls -l` renders —
so the two can never disagree on what a mode means (`AGENTS.md` §2.2); the
permission string's leading type indicator reads from the structural
`FileStat::kind`, so a bundle is *labelled* "Application" yet honestly shows a
directory's `d`, and a link labelled "Alias to folder" still shows `l`. The model reads nothing and holds no authority: the app
performs the one capability-checked `fs_stat` under the user's own identity and
hands the result here, so the trusted picker composes the same view.

### The Properties window

The closed `render::Field` vocabulary is the one definition of *which* facts
the General section states and how each reads — Kind, a link's stored target,
Size (apparent plus on-disk), and the four timestamps — so the display order,
each label, each value, and which facts a given node shows can never drift
apart. The alias row appears only for a node that stores a target and carries
the spelling the link holds verbatim, which is what explains a broken one. The
facts are a `lib/controls` `FactList` — muted label, right-aligned value,
separated rows. The trusted picker shows no Properties: choosing a file needs
none.

The **file manager's Properties is a window of its own**
(`render::draw_properties_window`, opened at `render::properties_window_extent`
and resizable thereafter). Several are open at once, each pinned to its node by
*path*, so the listing behind them may be reloaded or navigated away from
without any of them describing or writing to something else — and the listing
stays usable while they are open, which an in-window modal could not offer.

The client is three bands: an **identity band** naming the subject, a **section
strip**, and the selected section's **body**. There is no second panel header
inside a window that already has a title bar.

- The identity band (`render::Identity`, `render::draw_identity`) draws the
  node's own artwork at 48 logical pixels beside its name in the
  `TextRole::ItemTitle` face, with a muted line stating what it is and how big.
  The artwork resolves through the shared icon cache and the same
  `media_for_named` classifier the listing types its rows with, so a node is
  pictured identically in both places, and it is resolved from the *name*
  alone, so the picture does not change under the reader when the read lands.
  The band is shared with the "Open With…" chooser rather than written twice
  (§2.2).
- The section strip is a `lib/controls` `Tabs` over the closed
  `render::PropertiesTab` vocabulary: **General** (the metadata facts),
  **Permissions** (the mode bits and the owning ids), **Attributes** (the
  extended-attribute store). Which section a field belongs to is the one
  `render::Field::tab` definition, so the strip, the body and the hit-test
  cannot disagree. While the strip holds the keyboard, `Left`/`Right` walk it
  without wrapping past either end, so every section is reachable with no
  pointer.

The three-band frame is resolved from the **client alone**, never from the
node, so which fields a node happens to show can no longer move a control
under the pointer: the single-column layout this replaced pushed every band
below an alias row down a line, so the same click meant different things on a
link and on a plain file. Each section gets the whole body, which is what
removes the crowding that made nine permission checkboxes sit a glyph apart.

`files.app` opens one with **`Alt+Enter`** on the selection or the context
menu's *Properties* row. The node is resolved from the listing that named it —
its path through the shared `Browser::selected_target_path` spelling — and then
**read off the event loop**: describing a node is one `fs_stat` plus one
`fs_attr_get` per attribute key, which on a contended volume is a visible stall
rather than a frame (`AGENTS.md` §28.1). The window states that it is reading
until the answer lands, and states a refusal's reason if the node can no longer
be named or described — an answer, not a crash, and never a fabricated summary
(`AGENTS.md` §2.24, §5.4). `render::properties_hit` is the one hit-test over
the whole client, so the precedence between its controls is stated once: the
capability-free permission toggles resolve before the privileged ownership
control, and a press on nothing resolves to nothing. It resolves the strip
before the body it selects, and then only the controls the **selected** section
actually drew — so a press can never reach a toggle on a section the user is
not looking at. It takes the same `PropertiesControls` the draw took — the
ownership gate and any open id editor among them — so a session that may not
reassign an owner resolves nothing on an ownership cell rather than opening an
editor whose commit could only be refused, and a press lands on exactly the
control that was painted.

The keyboard is scoped the same way, through the host-tested
`route::properties_key`. The strip holds the keyboard to begin with: there
`Left`/`Right` walk it and `Escape` closes the window. The **Permissions**
section takes the keyboard on `Down` or `Tab` and hands it back on `Tab` or
`Escape`; while it holds it, the arrows and `Space`/`Enter` are its own (below).
On the **Attributes** section everything but the strip's arrows belongs to its
list and editor. So no key reaches a control the selected section does not
draw.

### Editing permissions

The permission-edit *model* (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM8b) is
`lib/browse::mode_edit`, host-proven ahead of the drawn permission control
exactly as the properties view model landed ahead of the drawn panel.
`validate_mode` fails closed on any bit above `tairix_abi::fs::FS_MODE_MASK` —
the settable `rwx`/setuid/setgid/sticky word — refusing it rather than masking
it into a lesser mode, so the mode committed is always exactly the one asked
for and never silently a different one (`AGENTS.md` §2.24, §5.4). `set_mode`
validates the mode *before* any syscall and applies it through an injected
`fs_set_mode` seam under the user's own identity — an ordinary
permission-checked VFS call, no new capability (`AGENTS.md` §4, §5.3). A VFS
refusal (the user does not own the node, a read-only mount, a lost race) leaves
the node's mode exactly as it was and is surfaced as `ModeError::Refused` for
an honest in-UI answer (`AGENTS.md` §2.24). The model reads nothing and holds
no authority, so the trusted picker never calls the write path.

### The drawn permission control

The Permissions section is composed of the shared form family
([`lib/controls`](../lib/controls.md), `FieldGroup`/`FieldRow`) and carries no
layout of its own: two groups stacked down the body by the shared plate column
(`tairix_controls::stack`). **ACCESS** holds the node's symbolic and octal mode
as a read-only `Reading` row, then one row per class — `Owner`, `Group`,
`Other` — whose slot is a `FlagSet` of three labelled `Checkbox`es, `Read`,
`Write` and `Execute`, reflecting the current mode. **OWNERSHIP** holds the two
owning ids (below). Every control in the section lines up in one column, the
width a class's flags need, so neither a node's reading nor an open id editor
can move one. `render::PERMISSION_BITS` and `permission_cells` are the one
definition of which of the nine owner/group/other bits each flag carries, and
the `Permission` arm of `render::properties_hit` returns the bit a click flips
(and nothing off a flag, fail closed). The paint, the hit-test and the keyboard
all read the one placement (`render::PermsSection`), so a click always lands
on the box it depicts (§2.2). Only the file manager's window draws it.

The window opens wide enough to seat every flag whole: its width is the larger
of its own floor and the access group's `natural_width`, so a wider type ladder
is seated rather than cut. A window dragged narrower keeps every box and elides
the labels through the checkbox's own mark. One dragged shorter than a section
keeps the section at its natural height and scrolls it through the body, a bar
beside it: the wheel (`properties_scroll_wheel`) and the bar
(`properties_scroll_pointer`) move it, a key that moves a cursor reveals the row
it lands on (`properties_reveal`), and a press lands only on what the scroll
shows. The General facts and the attribute list scroll the same way; each
window holds one `ScrollColumn`, and a section switch starts the new section at
its top.

The keyboard reaches every control the pointer does. Once the section holds
it, `Up`/`Down` walk the rows and carry from one group into the next,
`Left`/`Right` walk an access row's flags — keeping the column as the cursor
moves between classes — and `Space`/`Enter` toggle the flag, or open the
ownership cell, the cursor rests on. `render::properties_permissions_key`
resolves that key to the same `PropertiesTarget` a press on the control is, so
the window acts on both through one path; the cursor itself is
`render::PermsCursor`, carried in `PropertiesView` beside the section's scroll.

A primary-button press on a toggle flips only that `rwx` bit — preserving the
current setuid/setgid/sticky bits (the settable word masked by `FS_MODE_MASK`,
dropping the non-settable file-type bits `fs_stat` also reports) — and commits
the new mode over `fs_set_mode` under the user's own identity. On success the
node is re-read, so what the window shows is what the kernel applied rather
than what was asked for; a refusal is stated on `stderr` and leaves both the
node's mode and the shown value exactly as they were (`AGENTS.md` §2.24,
§5.4). The setuid/setgid/sticky bits stay visible in the octal and symbolic
spelling and are edited through the `chmod` command — a deliberate scope
boundary for a bloat-free surface, not an omission.

### Editing ownership

The ownership-edit *model* (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM8b) is
`lib/browse::owner_edit`, host-proven ahead of the drawn ownership control
exactly as the permission-edit model landed ahead of its control. It is
deliberately unlike the other write verbs (rename, mode, mkdir), which are the
user's own per-inode-checked writes needing no new capability: reassigning a
file's **owner** is a privileged operation, so it is gated by a dedicated
capability, `CAP_FS_CHOWN` — the Unix `CAP_CHOWN` analogue, carried by the
administrator ceiling and by nothing an ordinary session holds (`AGENTS.md`
§5.2). The whole authority rule lives kernel-side in the secured VFS behind the
`fs_set_owner` syscall: reassigning the uid, or setting a group the caller is
not a member of, requires `CAP_FS_CHOWN`; otherwise only the node's owner may
change the group, and only to a group they already belong to (the unprivileged
`chgrp`). Any successful change clears the set-user-ID bit (and the
set-group-ID bit of a group-executable node — a set-group-ID directory keeps
it), so a reassigned file can never carry a stale set-*id* escalation, the
standard `chown(2)` safety behaviour.

The engine models none of that policy. `OwnerChange` names *what* to change —
each of `uid`/`gid` is either `None` (leave unchanged) or `Some(id)` (set) —
and `validate_owner` fails closed on a field set to the reserved
`FS_OWNER_UNCHANGED` sentinel as an explicit target, refusing it before any
syscall rather than misreading it as "unchanged". `set_owner` validates before
any syscall, maps `None` onto the sentinel, and applies through an injected
`fs_set_owner` seam under the user's own identity; a VFS refusal — including
the `PermissionDenied` a caller without `CAP_FS_CHOWN` receives — leaves the
ownership exactly as it was and is surfaced as `OwnerError::Refused` for an
honest in-UI answer (`AGENTS.md` §2.24, §5.4). The model holds no authority, so
the trusted picker never calls the write path.

### The drawn ownership control

The section's **OWNERSHIP** group holds an **Owner** row and a **Group** row,
each carrying its id in its slot. Where the launching user holds `CAP_FS_CHOWN`
— read once from the kernel-attested `self_origin` at start-up — the id is a
pressable plate, so it reads as "press to change this". Where they do not, the
same plates are shown refused: the rows' state is `NeedsCapability`, so they
wear the Authority Mark, the group's footnote says why, and a press or a key on
them resolves to nothing (`AGENTS.md` §2.24). While one is being edited, the
row's slot holds the shared `lib/controls` `TextField` itself, published as
`render::properties_owner_editor_rect` for the host that feeds it keys, and a
press on it leaves the typing alone rather than reopening the editor. The plate
matters: an *idle text field* draws like the live one, so a reader could not
tell whether their keys were landing.

`render::OwnerField` and the `Owner` arm of `render::properties_hit` resolve a
click to exactly the uid or gid cell it edits — one placement serving the drawn
cell and the hit-test (§2.2) — and a click off a cell resolves nothing (fail
closed, §5.4). Like the permission control the write surface is separated by
call site, *and* additionally gated on the runtime capability, since owner
reassignment is privileged. Switching section abandons a half-typed id and hands
the keyboard back to the strip: both belong to the section they are drawn in,
and either left live behind a section the user cannot see would take their
next keystroke.

The editor opens on a click, or on `Space`/`Enter` from the section's keyboard
cursor, pre-filled with the current id and bounded to a
`u32`'s ten digits, live-validates the typed value, and on `Enter` commits over
`fs_set_owner` under the user's own identity (the kernel enforces
`CAP_FS_CHOWN` and the group-membership rule); `Escape` cancels. A non-numeric
or out-of-range id, or a VFS refusal, states its reason in the field and keeps
the editor open, an honest answer rather than a silent or fabricated result
(`AGENTS.md` §2.24, §5.4). On success the node is re-read so the window
reflects the new owner.

### Extended attributes

The Attributes section lists the node's visible extended attributes (the ARXFS
`namespace.name` store, `plans/ARXFS-METADATA.md`) and can set and remove them.
The section is named by its own tab, so it carries no heading of its own; its
`key = value` editor and the *Set* / *Remove* buttons beside it sit on a
control-height band at the foot. The kernel omits keys whose namespace the
caller may not read, so the window only ever sees what it may show: there is no
privileged-namespace surface to build, and `system.*` / `trusted.*` are
invisible rather than refused. Four states are distinguished rather than shown
as one empty list — a volume that stores no attributes says so, a listing that
was refused states its reason, a node that carries none says *none*, and the
`Visible` set is drawn as selectable rows scrolling in the band above the
editor, which stays put; the cursor over them is the shared `RowList`.

Values are opaque bytes, so every one is shown through the shared
`tairix_fsmeta::attr::display_value` escaping (`\xNN` for anything that is not
control-free UTF-8): nothing a volume stored reaches a surface raw. Clicking a
row loads it into the `key = value` editor for editing in place — and a value
whose bytes a typed line could not reproduce is offered back by key alone, with
the reason stated, rather than lossily rewritten. *Set* applies the line and
*Remove* deletes the cursor row's attribute, both through
`fs_attr_set`/`fs_attr_remove` needing only the `CAP_FS_ACCESS` the app already
holds — the real gate is the node's own write permission. The key is validated
through the shared `tairix_fsmeta::attr::parse_assignment` grammar *before* the
call, so a malformed or unknown-namespace key is refused in the app rather than
travelling to the kernel to be refused there; the kernel still owns every
authorisation (write permission, a writable mount, the fixed size bounds, the
privileged namespaces). A refusal states its reason and leaves the shown value
alone (`AGENTS.md` §2.24), and every applied change re-reads the node, so the
window shows what the kernel stored rather than what was typed (`AGENTS.md`
§28.4).

The on-disk `AttrFlags` (`SYSTEM`, `NO_BACKUP`) are a deliberate, stated
omission: no syscall surfaces them, so the window cannot show them and does not
invent them. Named streams (a `mac.resourcefork`'s content) are likewise staged
future work.

### Resizable window

The file manager opens its window `resizable`, so the window manager presents
it with a live maximize/restore size toggle and a resize grabber (a fixed-size
app is offered neither). On a `WindowEvent::Resized` the `Run` binary re-maps
its zero-copy frame region at the new client size and re-presents; the shared
`lib/browse` renderer lays the toolbar, listing, and scrollbar out to
whatever viewport it is handed, so the content fills the new size with no
per-size layout code. The re-map is fail-closed (`AGENTS.md` §5.4): a fresh
region is allocated and granted and adopted only once the session accepts
`WindowClient::resize`; the old region is released only after adoption, and a
refused or unallocatable resize leaves the current window intact rather than
blanking or crashing. The floor is *declared* on the window create
(`WindowSizing`) and enforced by the window manager, so a drag simply stops
there. It is **derived**, not hand-picked. Its width,
`tairix_browse::win_floor_width(scale, theme)`, is the larger of what a listing
still reads at and what the command toolbar's own tools need across
(`Toolbar::natural_length`), resolved at the desktop's density — the ABI field
is *physical* pixels while every desktop length is authored in logical ones.
That is what keeps the strip from ever being handed a band too narrow for its
tools: the shared `Toolbar` would then scroll, and a browser view rebuilds its
strip per frame so it holds no offset to scroll with. Its height,
`tairix_browse::browser_floor`, is one whole row of the listing beneath the
bands the window draws (`render::listing_floor_height`) — a line of tiles in
the grid, a row in the list — so a window can be made exactly one row tall,
and the window restates it as the view or its bands change. A Properties
window declares its own (`properties_sizing`). The app must not clamp a granted size itself: resizing its
own window back up while a drag keeps shrinking makes the two fight once per
pointer sample, which is what made the listing visibly bounce as the window
approached its minimum. An app never answers a resize with a larger size of
its own.

**The window is never taller than its listing.** Its height ceiling is what
the listing, and the places rail beside it, fill at the window's width
(`render::fitted_height`), declared through `tairix_browse::fitted_sizing`:
a drag stops there, a maximize grows no further, and a listing that shrinks —
a file deleted, a wider grid folded into fewer lines — restates it, and the
window manager brings the window down to it. A drag in flight follows the
ceiling as it is restated: narrowing a window folds its grid into more lines
and raises the ceiling, and the same drag can take the window that much
taller. A window opens at the height its
listing fills, up to the ordinary browser height (`manager_opening`, the one
rule a host reconstruction of the window shares), so an empty folder opens a
short window rather than one with a blank band beneath it; the first listing
is read before the window exists, so it opens at that height rather than
shrinking to it. Moving to another folder fits the window afresh as a new one
there would open, never taller than its user made it. A listing still being
read changes nothing until it lands.

**The window is glass.** It is drawn on `MANAGER_WINDOW_GROUND`, the frosted
window ground the Settings and Switchboard windows use: the listing's ground
lets the blurred desktop through, and it asks the compositor for that blur
before its first frame and on every desktop change. What it lays over its
own content — the rename field, the delete and progress dialogs, the "Open
With…" chooser, a Properties window — keeps the opaque theme
(`tairix_theme::Grounds`).

Icon-only buttons size their glyph from the plate itself — the smaller plate
dimension inside its frame, less a small margin proportional to the plate
(`lib/controls` `icon_content_side`) — rather than from the text inset
(`control_inset`, tuned to keep a *line of type* clear of the frame). On the
default 28px control plate the text inset left only a ~6px glyph adrift in the
button (the "tiny icon" defect); the proportional margin instead fills roughly
three-quarters of the plate. This is the one `lib/controls` icon-button paint
path, so every icon-only button across the desktop (the file manager's
navigation and manager-write tools, window controls, the taskbar) benefits
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

## Terminal emulator (`tairix-terminal`)

The terminal emulator hosts the system shell and shows its output on a
character-cell screen rendered through the active theme. Like the browser it is
split into a screen **model** and a **renderer**, both driven by an injected
shell I/O seam, so the parsing and rendering logic is testable without a kernel
(`AGENTS.md` §7).

### The shell seam

`ShellSource::read()` returns the bytes the shell has produced since the last
call (an empty read is not an error) and `ShellSource::write(bytes)` forwards
the user's keystrokes. On a running system the seam is
`spawned::PipeShellSource` (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW4): two kernel pipes to a
shell child the terminal spawned under its own `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`, wired at
spawn through `spawned::shell_wires` — the child's stdin is the keystroke
pipe and its stdout *and* stderr land on the one output pipe a terminal
renders (fd 3 is closed; advisory records are best-effort by contract).
Reads drain one bounded chunk per wait-set wake and surface end-of-stream as
the typed "shell has exited" refusal; writes loop over short writes and fail
closed on a wedged channel. The process-spawn authority lives in the `Run`
binary, behind the seam, not in the screen model.

### The screen model

`Grid` is a fixed `cols`×`rows` rectangle of `lib/vt` `Cell`s — a glyph plus
its folded `Attributes` — with a cursor and a rendition pen. It exposes the
cursor-relative operations a terminal needs: writing a glyph with the pen
(wrapping and scrolling at the edges), the C0 moves, absolute/relative cursor
positioning, the ANSI erase operations, the scroll region and explicit
scrolling, the alternate screen, cursor visibility, the saved cursor, the
window title, and clear.

`Parser` is a thin **consumer** of the shared `lib/vt` ANSI/VT/xterm
vocabulary (`plans/CURSES.md` C2): it lets `lib/vt`'s streaming parser turn
shell output bytes into the shared `Op` vocabulary and applies each `Op` to
the grid, so there is exactly one escape-sequence definition in the tree, not
a second divergent one (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The emulator is xterm-class —
printable text and Unicode, the C0 controls, SGR rendition with the
16/256/truecolour colour models, cursor addressing, the erase operations, the
scroll region (`DECSTBM`), the alternate screen (`?1049`), cursor visibility
(`?25`), the saved cursor (`ESC 7`/`ESC 8`), and the OSC window title — and it
honestly advertises `xterm-256color` because every capability that name
implies is really parsed (the compiled-in capability database is the next
`plans/CURSES.md` stage, `lib/termcap`). Because `lib/vt`'s parser is total, an
unrecognised, oversized, or malformed sequence is consumed without disturbing
the screen, so an unfamiliar stream degrades to dropped control rather than a
corrupted display or a panic (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).

`Terminal` ties the grid, the parser, and the seam together: `pump` reads the
shell's output and applies it to the screen, and `send` / `send_str` forward
input. The terminal never echoes input itself — echo, line editing, and job
control are the shell's responsibility, exactly as on a real tty — and a
failing seam call surfaces the boundary `Errno` while leaving the screen
unchanged (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

Because "echo, line editing, and job control are the shell's responsibility"
presumes a real tty *between* the emulator and the shell, the correct shell
channel is a **pseudo-terminal** whose slave carries the kernel's tty line
discipline (local echo, cooked line editing, `CR`/`LF`→`CR LF` on both
directions, `Ctrl-C`/`Ctrl-Z` job control), reusing the same discipline the
hardware console runs — never a second copy (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). That pty is
staged in `plans/PTY.md`; the environment-forwarding half (below) has landed.

### The size it opens at

A terminal's natural size is a character count, not a pixel count, so the
window is whatever the conventional 80×25 screen (`layout::COLS` ×
`layout::ROWS`) measures in the face actually being drawn with — the face's
own advance and line height, resolved from the font service at runtime, never
a compile-time constant. The window furniture is allowed for through the one
shared `WindowFrame::insets` definition the compositor decorates with
(`layout::chrome_insets`), so the app and the window manager cannot disagree
about how much room a decorated window needs.

When a display cannot hold that grid, the **text size** gives, never the grid:
`layout::fit_font_size` steps the profile's size down a logical pixel at a
time until the 80×25 screen plus its furniture fits, stopping at
`MIN_FONT_SIZE_PX`. A terminal that quietly dropped to 60 columns would break
every program that lays itself out for 80. The default 14-logical-pixel size
puts the framed window inside a 640×480 display with room left for the
taskbar, and a denser display multiplies it through the desktop scale. The
staged design is `plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md`.

### Rendering

`Screen` owns a `tairix-raster` `Surface` the size of the window's client
area and **keeps it between frames**, using the shared `tairix-font`
monospace family (Inconsolata EX plus the M PLUS 1 Code Japanese, D2Coding
Korean, and Noto Sans Hebrew companions). Hebrew and Yiddish letters,
final forms, punctuation, and marks occupy individual terminal cells;
Japanese and precomposed Hangul full-width bitmaps paint their lead and
continuation cells as one unit, so a continuation-cell background cannot erase
half a glyph.
Each cell is drawn with its own rendition: its
`lib/vt` `Attributes` select the foreground and background, resolved one way
through the user's colour scheme — a `Default` colour takes the scheme's own
foreground / background, the 16 basic colours and the low 16 palette entries
take the scheme's ANSI slots, the 6×6×6 cube and greyscale ramp above them are
the fixed xterm arithmetic no scheme reinterprets, truecolour is used
directly, `reverse` swaps the pair, and `bold` brightens a basic colour. The
visible cursor cell is drawn as the scheme's cursor block. The surface is
rectangular; the compositor places and rounds it through its single
anti-aliased rounded-corner path, so there is no rounding in the app. Every
length saturates so a viewport smaller than the grid paints what fits rather
than panicking.

#### A repaint costs what changed, not a window

`Screen::paint` holds the cells the surface was last painted from and
compares the grid against them, so a frame redraws only the block that
differs and returns it as the rectangle to present. A keystroke costs the
cell it wrote and the two the cursor moved between — a couple of glyph
blits, a couple of cells copied into the shared frame, and a two-cell
damage rectangle for the session to recomposite — rather than re-rendering,
re-converting, and re-presenting the whole window for one character. A wake
that changed nothing presents nothing at all. Two equal cells paint
identically only under the same colours and the same face, so a theme or
scale change calls `Screen::invalidate` and the next paint covers the window.
A *profile* change calls it only when it moved one of those two: a backdrop
blur the compositor draws behind the window, or a post-processing pass over
the finished frame, leaves every retained cell still true, so a drag of
either of those sliders keeps the diff rather than throwing a screenful away
per sample. A resize needs no such call: the present step reconciles the
picture to the display mode describing the shared frame region, so the two
can never disagree, and reshaping invalidates implicitly.
A damaged block is widened to whole glyphs before it is drawn, so
overwriting the continuation half of a wide glyph repaints its lead cell
too. The equivalence that makes this safe is a unit test: an incremental
repaint must land pixels byte-identical to a fresh whole-window paint of the
same grid, across typing, cursor moves, scrolling, rendition changes,
erases, and wide-glyph clobbering.

### Colour schemes, the profile, and screen effects

`scheme.rs` is the one place a terminal colour comes from: a `ColorScheme` is
the sixteen ANSI slots plus background, foreground, cursor, and cursor text,
and `Painted` resolves the scheme in force once per repaint rather than once
per cell. **System** follows the desktop's own dark/light appearance and is
the default, taking its ground from the theme's *document* role rather than its
window surface: a terminal's grid is a page, and the full-screen editors that
draw on it (`edit`, `vim`) are editing text on it, so it belongs on the same
ground an editable field does. **Midnight**, **Phosphor**, **Amber**,
**Ember**, **Contrast**,
and **Paper** carry fixed palettes; **Custom** is the user's own, editable in
the settings sheet.

Everything a user can change is one `Profile`, held in the OS app-data store
and reached through [`tairix-appdata`](../lib/appdata.md). It is private to
this application: the store is gated on the bundle identity the kernel attests,
so no other app the user launches can read or rewrite it — see
[the app-data service](../userland/confd.md).

A save writes only the keys whose value differs from what the store's layers
already imply, so the user's own document holds what they changed rather than a
copy of every default; *Restore defaults* removes those opinions instead of
freezing today's values, so a machine-wide policy or a later shipped default
then applies. A key no layer sets means its documented default; a stored value
the registry refuses leaves that one field at its default and names the key on
`stderr`; and a store the service cannot serve leaves the bundle's shipped
defaults standing, also said on `stderr`. Colours are written as bare `rrggbb`
because the format's comment marker would cut a `#`-prefixed value away.

The settings sheet writes nothing while a control is still moving: a drag is
shown live and saved once it settles, on a worker, one write at a time. The
store's answer applies to every setting the user has not touched since that
write was asked for, so a machine-wide policy still wins where the user is not
editing and an answer landing mid-drag never moves the slider under the
pointer. A *Restore defaults* asked for behind an outstanding write waits for
it rather than being displaced, and a refused write says why on `stderr` and
puts the settings it carried back to what the store holds.

The screen effects are an ordered, typed pipeline (`effects::Pass`) rather
than code inlined into the renderer, so a display that can composite hardware
layers can programme its own engine from the same description with the
software passes staying the conformance oracle. Translucency is not a pass at
all: the default background is filled at the profile's alpha, so the
compositor's own premultiplied blend shows the desktop through while a glyph
stays opaque. Backdrop blur is the compositor's (`set_backdrop_blur`), since
only it can see behind a window. Scan lines, glow, fuzz, phosphor persistence,
and wobble run over the finished frame. **Glow** is halation, the spatial half
of a tube's light to phosphor's temporal half: the light of brightly-driven
pixels spread into their neighbourhood and added back, so bright text carries a
soft halo. Its drive is a pixel's peak channel rather than a luma weighting —
a phosphor driven to full emits as much light whatever its colour, and weighted
red would carry no halo at all — and the spread is the desktop's one separable
box blur (`tairix_raster::box_blur`) run twice, so the falloff is a tent rather
than a box with a visible edge. A knee at half scale is what makes it read as
light off the text rather than a flat wash, and the intensity is a *gain*: at
full strength the halo is brighter than the light it was spread from, which is
what makes a lit glyph bloom rather than merely soften. It is still capped for
the reason the opacity floor exists: a slider must not be able to make text
unreadable. An animated effect is a pure function of a
monotonically increasing `Phase` that the program advances on a one-shot frame
deadline in its wait-set park — there is no poll loop, and a terminal with the
effects off never wakes for them at all.

A new terminal opens at **80% opacity with the backdrop blurred at half
strength** (`Effects::default`), the five pass effects off. Translucency is
free — it is the alpha the background is filled at, so the compositor's own
blend does the work — and the blur is what makes the window read as frosted
glass rather than as a hole. A screenful of them is affordable because
frosting is rationed front to back: what the frost cache's budget reaches is
frosted, and a terminal beneath that composites as the plain translucent window
it also is (`docs/src/desktop/wm.md`, *Frosting is rationed, front to back*).

A pass is a *whole-frame* post-process by nature — wobble displaces rows,
phosphor decays every pixel, and the glow spreads light across them — so when
one is in force the finished screen is
copied into a reused buffer, the passes run there, and the whole window is
presented. The retained screen itself stays clean, so the next frame's cell
diff still describes the text rather than the effect's own churn, and an
animated terminal re-runs its passes without re-rendering the grid. That
buffer exists only while an effect is on. Translucency and backdrop blur are
not passes, so a see-through, frosted terminal still types at cell-diff
cost.

### The menu and the settings sheet

A secondary (right) press asks the **desktop** for this window's menu:
*Settings…*, *Larger text*, *Smaller text*, *Actual size*, *Clear screen*, and
*Close*, each with a keyboard shortcut that really works whether or not the
menu is open. The terminal sends a row model and the window-local point it was
handed, and receives one outcome ([Menus](menus.md)); it draws no plate pixel,
never learns where the pointer is inside one, and cannot hold one open. A
refused menu is reported on `stderr` and the terminal carries on with none —
never a fallback to drawing its own.

The settings sheet reports what it changes. The shared controls report the
fields they redraw into a damage sink and report **nothing** for a sample that
leaves a control where it already was, so resting the pointer on one costs no
frame — and a round that *did* report keeps its whole-plate repaint, because a
change the sheet composes above its controls (a switched tab's body) is wider
than the rectangle the control that caused it reports.

*Settings…* opens a modal sheet built from the shared Reactive
Alloy controls: an **Appearance** tab (the scheme chooser, the text-size
slider, and the custom scheme's twenty colour wells with the shared colour
picker editing the selected one, which shows the well's colour as it was when
it was selected beside it) and an **Effects** tab (one slider per effect). The
picker walks its own parts on Tab before the sheet moves on, takes Escape back
from a drag or typing before the sheet is dismissed, and settles a field it
leaves; a drag or a typed spelling is live, and only its settle is written.
Editing the custom scheme while another is in force repaints no terminal,
since nothing it shows has changed. Every edit clamps
through `Profile::clamp`, re-derives the colours and the face, reshapes the
grid — the pty window size follows, so the shell re-lays-out — and writes the
document.

### The `Run` bundle

`terminal.app`'s entry point reads the user's profile, creates the pty, spawns the user's default
shell (`tairix_users::policy::DEFAULT_SHELL`) forwarding its own **inherited
environment** to the shell (`USER`, `HOME`, `LOGNAME`, `PATH`, `LANG`, …, with
the emulator's own `TERM` replacing any inherited one — the shared,
host-tested `spawned::shell_env` rule), so the shell's prompt and its children
run under the logged-in user's identity and locale instead of the anonymous
`user@host` fallback, exactly as the desktop session forwards the environment
to every app it launches. The child-side pipe ends are closed after the spawn
(so each side observes the other's end-of-file honestly). It then creates and
grants the zero-copy window frame
region, and **parks** on one wait-set with three members — its window-event
mailbox (`Port`), the shell-output pipe's read end (`Stream`, the AW4 kernel
addition: ready on buffered bytes or end-of-stream), and the shell child
(`Child`) — dispatching on the woken member's token, never a poll loop. The
park carries a one-shot frame deadline only while an animated screen effect is
in force. A key press is claimed by an open menu or settings sheet, else by a
terminal accelerator, else encoded through the one shared `lib/keymap` rule
and written to the shell (releases send nothing); shell output is pumped into
the grid and the repainted frame presented. The shell exiting closes its
window. The user choosing *Close*, or a `CloseRequested` from the desktop,
closes the window and ends its shell with `Terminate`; the window's child
member stays on the wait-set until the shell is reaped. Each shell anchors a
session of its own inside the terminal's, so the jobs started in a window end
with its shell, and every window's shell ends with the terminal
(`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`). Every bring-up refusal exits
fail-loud with a reserved code and its reason on `stderr`. The desktop's
program-library popup lists the terminal's catalog entry, which spawns the
bundle (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5), and
the autoload QEMU vertical types a real command into the served window at
the seat keyboard, PASSing only on the kernel-attested keyboard → session →
terminal → pipe → shell → spawn round trip.

## Date & Time (`tairix-datetime`)

The `datetime.app` bundle sets the machine's wall clock
(`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T17). It is reached from the [taskbar clock's own
menu](taskbar.md#the-clocks-menu) rather than from the program library —
its manifest deliberately carries no `library` key, because the app is
useful only to somebody who can authenticate an account that may set the
clock.

**It is *given* the authority; it never assumes it.** Stepping the clock
needs `CAP_TIME_SET`, which the manifest requests and the kernel grants
as `manifest ∩ the launching account's ceiling`. A desktop session holds
no such capability and must never hold one, so it re-authenticates an
account that does through its console's elevation broker (see [the
desktop session](session.md#asking-for-an-account-that-may)) and the
broker starts this program *as that account*. The app performs no
authentication itself and asks for no elevation.

A refused set is therefore an ordinary outcome, not a defect: the app
states it in its window **and** on `stderr`, leaves the clock untouched,
and keeps running. It never reports a clock it did not change as changed,
and a refused authentication reads differently from a program that would
not start.

**One calendar, shared.** Seeding decomposes the reading with
`CivilTime::from_time64`; committing composes the instant with
`days_from_civil` — the exact inverse, from the same `lib/fsmeta`
calendar the desktop clock and `ls`'s date column read, so the app and
the bar can never disagree about what time it is. There is no second
day-counting rule and no leap-year table of the app's own.

**An unset clock shows nothing.** A machine whose wall time has never
been established reports `WallTimeState::Unset`, whose instant is the
epoch placeholder and means nothing; the fields open empty and the window
says so, rather than presenting `1970-01-01` as a reading the user is
invited to correct. Empty fields compose nothing, so an unset clock
cannot be committed by accident.

**Validation refuses, never corrects.** All six fields — year, month and
day in the first group, hour, minute and second in the second — are checked
before anything is set, and the first fault is named in the window: a
month outside 1–12, an hour outside 0–23, a minute or second outside
0–59, or a day that does not exist in the month and year entered (31
April, 29 February outside a leap year). Nothing is clamped, wrapped, or
saturated into range, because that would set a time the user did not ask
for. Dates before 1970 and beyond 2038 are ordinary input: the instant is
a 64-bit `Time64`, and the reading is UTC because the system keeps no
timezone offset.

The host-tested engine holds the fields, the faults, the composition, and
the one status line; `view` holds the window's geometry and its paint
through the shared `lib/controls` dialog and the form-field family — two
captioned `FieldGroup`s, the date above the time, each row a label and a
`TextField` in its slot. The window's extent is measured from what those
groups need at the active density and type ladder, so a wider ladder is
seated rather than pushed under the action band. The `Run` binary is the usual
windowed-app composition: one granted frame region, one event mailbox
parked on a wait-set, and the `WindowClient` calls.

## Picture and document viewer (`tairix-view`)

The `view.app` bundle is the desktop's viewer for pictures and documents
(`plans/VIEW.md`): the app the file manager hands a picture to, and a resident
application that asks the session's trusted picker when the user clicks its
icon-bar slot. It claims JPEG, PNG, SVG, GIF, TIFF, WEBP, BMP, ICO and
RISC OS Sprite — every format the decoder supports *completely*. PDF is
deliberately absent from its `associations` until `lib/pdf` lands behind the
same page source: claiming a format with no decoder behind it would offer the
viewer for a file it must always refuse.

**It is a viewer.** It holds no write capability and has no editing, saving,
export, annotation, or printing — which is why it needs no filesystem
authority of its own.

### One instance, a window per document, resident on the bar

The viewer is a **single** instance with a window per document: a second
document opens a second window in the one process, which is the rule for every
application with an icon-bar slot. Containment is not lost by it — each
window's document is decoded in its **own** sandbox, so a malformed file
crashes its own decoder and disturbs no other window, and each `Job` and answer
carries its window's key so one window's decode can never land in another.

Launched by the user it opens **no window at all** and simply takes its slot:
with nothing to display there is nothing to show, and the session shows a
served window on its first present, so opening one would put an empty frame on
the desktop. A primary click on the slot opens a window and asks the picker;
that window's present stays withheld until there is something in it. A pick the
user *cancels* closes that window rather than leaving it stating a refusal they
already know about, while a pick the session *refuses* and a document that will
not decode both state their reason in the window — a refusal is something to
show.

Closing a window keeps the process and the slot; only the slot's **Quit** row
ends it. The decoder of a closed window is ended by a job on the worker (the
sandboxes are the worker's and the loop may not reach them), so a window's
child process goes with its window.

One job is outstanding at a time and the window it is asked *for* rotates: the
desk is latest-wins, so submitting while one is in flight would displace a job
a window is waiting for, and a fixed scan order would let an animating window
starve another's open. An `Open` additionally carries a monotonic **open id**,
echoed back and dropped on mismatch — the same rule a render's echoed shape
has — so closing a window with a read in flight cannot land a stale document in
a later one.

### Two capabilities the viewer does not have, and one it does

Its manifest requests `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE`, `CAP_SHM` and `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`,
and deliberately **no filesystem capability**. A document reaches it only as
the user's own act: a read-only descriptor the file manager had the kernel
clone in at spawn (`DOCUMENT_ROLE_ARG` plus `STDIN`, the inherited-document
hand-off), the one-shot `fd_grant` a `FilePicked` carries after the user chose a
file in the *session's* UI under the *session's* authority, or a `Document`
open target the session **relayed** from a launcher that opened the file
itself — all three installed by the unprivileged `fd_redeem`. A `Path` open
target it cannot act on at all, and says so on `stderr` rather than pretending
to: it holds no authority to open a name with.

`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` is what lets the viewer re-enter its own binary as a
capability-empty decoder: the capability starts no child but one holding
nothing beyond its two wired pipes, whatever binary it runs. A document is
untrusted input and is **never**
decoded in the viewer's address space: `Run` measures the descriptor, streams
it to the worker in `MAX_DOCUMENT_CHUNK` pieces under a fixed input-byte
ceiling, and drives `open_view` / `select_page` / `render_page` against it.
The worker inherits nothing but its two wired pipes, so it holds strictly
less authority than the viewer, and a malformed or hostile file crashes it and
nothing else — the seam replaces it and the viewer states the refusal.

### Three spaces, and the request that keeps them exact

A page has a natural pixel size; the user may turn or mirror it, giving the
**displayed** size; the zoom scales that; and the canvas shows a window of the
result. The engine is careful about which space a value is in, because the
worker holds the page and knows nothing of the user's turn:

* the render request names an extent and a window **in page space**, so it is
  the same shape whichever backing answers it — a raster page resampled, or a
  drawing rasterised afresh at that extent;
* setting that page-space extent down through the user's turn gives back
  exactly the extent the viewer believes it is displaying, which is the
  property that makes panning exact to the screen pixel at any magnification;
* the window rectangle is mapped between the two spaces through
  `Reorient`'s own position map rather than a second piece of orientation
  arithmetic, so the rectangle asked for and the pixels the turn produces
  cannot disagree.

The turn itself is applied in the app, not the worker: it is a permutation of
pixels the app already holds and has validated, and the app holds
*premultiplied* pixels where the wire is straight alpha, so turning in the
worker would be a lossy round trip for no gain. `Surface::reorient_into`
re-fills a destination the app already holds, so panning a rotated picture
allocates nothing per pointer sample.

### Nothing waits on the loop that owes a frame

Reading the file and driving the sandbox both wait on something, so both run
on the shared worker desk (`tairix_rt::work::Worker`), whose state *is* the
sandbox session — open once, then draw from the page it holds. The loop
submits and carries on drawing; the answer arrives as a wake on the wait-set
it already parks in. The pixel buffer travels with the job and comes back in
the answer, so an interactive re-render allocates nothing once the geometry
has settled.

An answer is adopted only if it still describes what the state calls for. A
rectangle the user has panned or zoomed away from is a real picture of the
wrong place, and drawing it at the current placement would put those pixels
somewhere they do not belong — so it is dropped, and the render the state now
wants is asked for instead. A page container's first render is the ordinary
case of that: the container declares its *largest* page, so a smaller page's
own geometry only becomes known when the entry is decoded, and the viewer
refits to the page and asks again.

Animation is one-shot and tickless: playback arms a single deadline from the
frame's own declared delay and the park wakes on the next window event **or**
that deadline, whichever is first. A paused viewer arms no timer at all.

### The window

`Layout::for_window` is the one definition of where every band sits, read
unchanged by the painter and by every hit-test. The toolbar is claimed from
the top edge and the status line from the bottom before the body, so however
small the window becomes the tools stay reachable and only the canvas gives up
room; an information panel too narrow to say anything is not drawn at all
rather than drawn as a useless strip. A thumbnail sidebar is not part of the
app yet and is deliberately absent rather than reserved — the worker holds one
decoded page, so a thumbnail render would displace the page on screen
(`plans/VIEW.md`).

The toolbar's tools are one ordered list — glyph, command, and tooltip at the
same position — so the picture a tool draws and the action it runs cannot be
wired up apart. Every surface that can ask for something resolves to that same
`Command` set: the toolbar, the keyboard, and the app-declared menu the
session draws (the app draws no menu pixel). The zoom slider is a *view* of
the viewport rather than a second copy of it, and its value is tied to no
write at all — a viewer persists nothing, so a drag is smooth by construction.

The wheel pans the desktop's one fixed distance a detent
(`tairix_controls::WHEEL_STEP`, already accelerated by the seat), and it turns
the canvas's own scrollbars: a detent over the picture pans exactly as far as
one over its bar, and what a turn leaves short of a pixel is carried between
them. The arrow keys and the bars' end buttons step one line, the same fixed
share of the canvas. A pan repaints only the bars: the picture held is drawn
where it was until the render the pan asks for lands, and that answer repaints
the canvas.

A pinch begun over the picture zooms it smoothly by the fingers' spread,
holding the point it began on under the fingers and carrying it with their
centre as they move — both measured from where the pinch began, so a long
pinch accumulates no rounding — and a cancelled pinch puts the view back.

Transparency is drawn against a checkerboard, so a transparent picture reads
as transparent rather than as the colour behind it.

### A picked document's name

`WindowEvent::FilePicked` carries the authority; the viewer then pulls the
chosen file's leaf name once with `TakePickedName`, so the title and the
information panel name a picked document, and a RISC OS sprite area — which
carries no signature and is reached only by its name — opens from the picker
as it does from the file manager. A name the session no longer holds leaves
the document unnamed rather than refusing it.
