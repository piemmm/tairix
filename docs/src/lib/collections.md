# `tairix-collections`

The **heap-backed** `no_std` containers TAIRiX runs on that `core` and `alloc`
have no answer for. `alloc` already supplies `Vec`, `String`, `BTreeMap`,
`BTreeSet`, `VecDeque`, and `BinaryHeap`; none of them is re-implemented here,
and a container with no caller in the tree is not added.
`plans/COLLECTIONS.md` is the ledger of what has landed and what is still to
come.

The containers that allocate *nothing* live in [`tairix-inline`](./inline.md) —
a crate that links neither this one nor `alloc`, so the layer running before a
heap exists can use them. This crate depends on it for the inline half of its
`SmallVec`.

`HashSet` and `SmallVec` are the two types here without an in-tree caller yet.
Every remaining `BTreeSet` is either order-load-bearing (`kernel/sec`'s
per-process thread set fans signals out in ascending id order) or small enough
that the ordered set is the cheaper structure; `SmallVec`'s first consumer is a
compositor damage list, which is measured rather than assumed. Both arrive with
a later tier.

## Inventory

| Type | Guarantee | Stands in for |
|---|---|---|
| `HashMap<K, V, S>` | expected O(1) lookup, insert, and remove; one control byte and one `(K, V)` slot per bucket, no per-entry node | a `BTreeMap` used where the key order was never wanted |
| `HashSet<T, S>` | the same, over a zero-sized value | a `BTreeSet` used as an unordered set |
| `LruMap<K, V, S>` | the same table with a recency order through it: expected O(1) lookup, touch, and eviction of the coldest entry | a cache's `(tick -> key)` `BTreeMap` eviction index, O(log n) on all three |
| `RangeMap<K, V>` | disjoint half-open ranges, each an identity: O(log n) covering lookup, insertion that refuses an overlap, and first-fit placement over the gaps | a `base -> length` `BTreeMap` plus a hand-written overlap probe, and the occupancy bitmap a window scanned to place |
| `RangeSet<K>` | the same storage canonicalised — insertion absorbs what it touches, removal splits what it cuts | a run set built by hand per subsystem, and the free-list that fragmented beside a live-region map |
| `SmallVec<T, N>` | inline to `N`, then one spill to the heap | a hot path that holds a handful of elements and allocates anyway |
| `ByteQueue` | a byte FIFO under its holder's bound, kept as one contiguous run; amortised O(1) per byte, storage committed up front or as bytes arrive, and wiped before it is given back | the session frame arena `lib/sandbox` carried privately, and the SSH transport's three stream buffers |
| `RadixTree<V, TAGS>` | a sparse `u64`-keyed index of 64-way nodes: lookup, insertion, removal and tagging cost the tree's height — eleven nodes at most — whatever it holds, and an ordered or tagged walk resumes from the path it last took | a sorted `Vec` whose every insertion moved the entries above it |

## `ByteQueue`

A stream parser wants the bytes it has not consumed as one slice — to find a
frame's end, to decrypt a packet where it lies — which `VecDeque` cannot give
without rotating a record that straddles its wrap. `ByteQueue` appends at the
tail, takes from the head, and reclaims the consumed prefix by compacting
once it reaches half the arena, so the move is paid for by at least that many
consumed bytes and a queue drained as fast as it fills never moves at all.

Its bound is the holder's containment policy, not a capacity: a sandbox
session commits it at admission so the session's cost is known before it runs
(`committed`), and an SSH connection commits storage only as bytes arrive
(`new`), so an idle one costs a few kilobytes and a hostile one at most its
bound. Growth is fallible either way.

It is the one container here that scrubs. Its element is a bare byte, which
no holder can make self-zeroing, and a byte stream is exactly what a session
key or a password transits; growing by reallocation would leave a copy in
freed memory. So growth builds a fresh arena and wipes the old one, and drop
wipes what remains. Bytes consumed inside live storage are not wiped as they
go — they are overwritten, or wiped with the arena.

## `LruMap`

A cache holds what fits and drops what has gone coldest, and both halves of
that must be constant time or the cache costs more than the misses it saves.
`LruMap` is one open-addressed index over a node arena, with the recency order
and the free list threaded through that arena as two
[`IntrusiveList`](./inline.md)s:

* the index bucket holds the *node handle*, not a copy of the key, so a key is
  stored once however many structures reach it;
* each node carries the hash it was filed under, so eviction reaches its bucket
  without hashing a key and a table rebuild moves entries without hashing any;
* an evicted node returns to the free list and the next insertion reuses it, so
  a map at its steady occupancy returns to the allocator not at all;
* `clear` releases both allocations rather than keeping the capacity, because
  the callers that drain a whole map are caches a memory-pressure band is
  reclaiming and holding their peak footprint afterwards is the memory the
  drain was for.

It evicts nothing on its own. A caller bounds it by its own budget — entries,
bytes, or a pressure band — and calls `pop_lru` until the bound is met, which
is what lets one map serve a fixed-entry index and a byte-budgeted cache alike.
`get`/`get_mut` are uses and refresh an entry; `peek`/`peek_mut` and
`iter_lru` are observations and do not, so a diagnostic read never changes what
eviction takes next.

Every link it splices names a node from its own arena, so a refused splice
means something outside the map corrupted its bookkeeping. Such a refusal is
fail-closed — nothing found, nothing inserted — and a debug assertion, since no
input reaches it.

## `RadixTree`

Six key bits a level, as tall as its largest key needs: a key below 2^24
costs four nodes, and none costs more than eleven.

* Each node keeps a bitmap of its occupied slots and, per tag, one of the
  slots whose subtree holds a tagged entry, so a successor or predecessor
  search, and a walk of only the tagged entries, skip empty and untagged
  subtrees a word at a time.
* A walk keeps the path to the entry it last found and resumes from the
  deepest node that entry and its successor share, so a whole walk reaches
  each node it passes a bounded number of times, never a descent per entry.
* Nodes live in two arenas, interior and leaf. A removal chains the nodes it
  empties into its arena's free list and lowers the tree once its largest key
  no longer needs the height, so the nodes resident are the live keys' paths
  and a tree at a steady size draws nothing from the allocator.
  `try_shrink_to_fit` moves the live nodes to the front of their arenas and
  gives the freed ones and any spare room back, `clear` gives back
  everything, and `allocated_bytes` says what the arenas hold: a holder
  under memory pressure can account for and return a tree's memory.
* `try_reserve_key` allocates every node one insertion of a key needs and
  changes nothing else. A holder updating several trees at once makes every
  allocation first, so it changes all of them or none: the IOVA space
  (`kernel/iommu/api`), its first consumer with one tree per buddy order,
  reserves the buddies a split will record before the split removes anything.

## `RangeMap` and `RangeSet`

Address space, block numbers, and slot indices are all held in *runs*, and
every subsystem that held them had written the same interval arithmetic: find
the entry at or below a point, ask whether it reaches the point, split what a
removal cuts, join what an insertion touches. Getting that wrong silently hands
out memory twice, so it is defined once.

The two types share one storage and one disjointness invariant, and differ
only in what they do to a neighbour:

* **`RangeMap` keeps neighbours apart.** An entry is an identity — a
  reservation, a mapping, a run of slots — so two abutting entries stay two,
  and an insertion that would *overlap* one is refused rather than replacing or
  splitting the holder. That refusal is the container carrying a rule its
  callers used to leave unstated: a second record over one address would make a
  fault's backing, and a release's extent, a choice between two answers.
* **`RangeSet` canonicalises.** An insertion absorbs every range it overlaps
  *or touches* and a removal splits the ranges it cuts, so two sets holding the
  same elements hold the same ranges whatever order they were built in. The
  entry count is then one per contiguous run: releasing a hundred-terabyte
  extent costs one entry, not one per block. It keeps a running `covered()`
  total in step with its entries, so a caller's accounting reads it rather than
  summing.

Only ordering decides overlap, adjacency, and splitting, so `RangeKey` carries
just the arithmetic that *measures* a range: `span` turns one `(base, count)`
pair into a range with the overflow checked in one place rather than at every
call site that counts pages, blocks, or slots, and `distance_from` reports what
a range holds. `u64` and `usize` implement it — byte addresses and block
numbers for the first, slot indices for the second.

### Placement is the gaps, not a second structure

`RangeMap::place` hands out the lowest run of free elements inside a window,
first-fit over the gaps *between* what the window has already handed out. That
is the whole free-space representation: a released range is available again the
moment its record leaves, two released neighbours serve one larger request
between them, and there is no free-list or occupancy bitmap to fall out of step
with the live records.

It replaced both halves of that mistake. The anonymous placement window kept a
released-hole map beside its live-region map, and the two holes a pair of
adjacent releases left never joined, so a request larger than either was
refused while the address space for it sat free. The MMIO window kept a
`Vec<bool>` of slot occupancy and first-fit *scanned* it — up to the window's
whole ceiling per placement, growing the bitmap to the deepest slot ever
touched. A 1 GiB register window is 262 144 slots; the mapper now records the
runs it handed out and nothing per slot, and a placement walks those runs.

## The rules every container obeys

1. **Nothing that can fail panics.** Every allocating operation has a fallible
   form returning `TryReserveError` — `try_insert`, `try_reserve`,
   `try_with_capacity_and_hasher`. No map has an `Index` implementation,
   because a subscript that panics on a missing key has no place in a kernel.
   The one allocation this crate does not own is the ordered tier's:
   `RangeMap` holds its entries in `alloc`'s `BTreeMap`, whose insertion cannot
   be made fallible from outside `alloc`, and re-implementing an ordered map is
   not this crate's business. Every *read* on that tier still allocates
   nothing.
2. **No allocation on a read path.** Lookup, iteration, and removal allocate
   nothing; growth is amortised and off the hot path.
3. **No fixed capacity ceiling.** A container here grows on demand and fails
   closed only on genuine exhaustion; a caller-chosen compile-time bound is the
   other crate's business.
4. **Order is unspecified unless the container says otherwise.** A hash
   container's iteration order varies with the hash key, the insertion
   history, and the capacity, so anything compared, logged, paged, or
   reproduced uses an ordered container.
5. **Secret hygiene is the holder's job.** A container does not scrub the slots
   it frees — reuse inside one address space is not a security boundary — so a
   holder of a key, credential, or capability token stores a value type that
   zeroes itself on drop, exactly as the userland heap in `lib/rt` already
   requires.

## Choosing a hasher

There is deliberately no default construction: `HashMap::with_hasher` takes the
`BuildHasher` explicitly, so the choice is visible wherever a map is created.

```rust,ignore
// Keys an attacker can choose or influence.
let map = HashMap::with_hasher(BuildSipHash13::keyed()?);

// Keys the kernel assigns itself.
let map = HashMap::with_hasher(BuildFastHash::new());
```

`BuildSipHash13::keyed` refuses to build until the per-boot key has been
published (see [`tairix-hash`](./hash.md)). Hashing attacker-chosen keys under
a predictable key lets an attacker pick a set that all collide, turning every
lookup into a linear scan; the keyed pseudo-random function removes the attack,
and refusing to construct is the fail-closed answer to being asked before the
key exists.

## The table

Open addressing over sixteen-lane control-byte groups. One byte beside each
slot holds either `EMPTY`, `DELETED`, or the key's seven-bit tag, and a probe
loads a whole group and asks three questions of it at once: which lanes carry
this tag, which are empty (the probe chain ends there), and which are free to
take an insertion. Lookup and insertion share that one primitive.

Groups are **aligned**: probing steps whole groups rather than a byte offset
into one. The control array therefore ends exactly at `buckets` bytes with no
wrap-around mirror of its head, and there is no paired-write invariant to
maintain on every control update — the simplification that keeps the `unsafe`
core small.

Two invariants carry the removal path:

* A group holding an empty lane has no probe chain passing *through* it.
  Insertion maintains it by only stepping past a group with no empty lane.
* Removal therefore writes `EMPTY` only into a group that already had one, and
  `DELETED` otherwise, which keeps every chain through that group intact.

The load-factor limit is seven eighths. When it is reached — by live entries,
by tombstones, or by both — the table rebuilds into a fresh allocation sized
for the live set, which grows it and clears its tombstones in one pass. A
steady live set therefore settles on a steady footprint no matter how much
churn passes through it.

## The group scan is a dispatched ops table

The scan is a [`lib/cpuops`](./cpuops.md) family: an SSE2 candidate, a NEON
candidate, and a portable word-at-a-time baseline. Which one runs is decided
once per boot (`kernel/core`'s `resolve_accelerated_ops`) through the
capability gate and the mandatory self-verify, so a vector instruction is never
reached on a core that lacks it, and a candidate that disagrees with the
baseline on any vector cannot be selected. It is never benchmarked: the control
bytes it reads are tags derived from the per-boot hash key, and a benchmark is
a timing measurement over exactly that.

A target whose vector unit is off compiles no candidate at all and calls the
baseline directly, paying neither the resolved-cell load nor an indirect call.
That is riscv64 and wasm32, which have no candidate; `x86_64-tairix-none` and
`aarch64-unknown-none` carry SSE2 and NEON in their own feature sets.
The build script makes that decision from the target's own feature set, so no
target-conditional predicate appears in the crate source.

The portable baseline's byte-equality test is *exact*. The shorter
`(x - 1) & !x` zero-byte trick lets one lane's borrow forge a match in the
next, which would make the baseline disagree with the exactly-comparing vector
candidates and so make the self-verify's bit-identity conditional on the input.

## Measurement

Probe depth, not elapsed time, is what a hash table's performance is, and
unlike a stopwatch it is reproducible on any machine — so it, and not a timing,
is what the crate's tests gate. `HashMap::probe_groups` reports the control
groups a lookup examines and `allocated_bytes` the resident footprint. At the
maximum load factor:

| Counter | Gate | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Control-group scans per hit | ≤ 1.5 | 1.12 with 7 168 live entries; 1.00 below the limit |
| Bytes per live entry | ≤ 1.15 × (entry + control byte) | 19.43 for a 16-byte entry, against a 19.55 budget — exactly 8/7 |
| `LruMap` scans per hit | ≤ 1.5 | 1.00 at 3 584 live entries, the table's load limit |
| `LruMap` bytes per live entry | ≤ 8/7 × (handle + control byte) + one node | 58.29 for a 16-byte entry, met exactly |
| `LruMap` allocations per touch, insert-over-a-freed-node, and eviction | 0 | 0, held across 4 096 rounds of churn and at 16, 1 024, and 16 384 entries |
| Ranges a placement walks | the live run count | 3, in a window of a billion slots — the count `overlapping` reports, and the bound on the work |
| Entries a window holds | one per live run | 1 for a 1 024-page scan-out mapping in a 262 144-slot window, where the bitmap it replaces grew to 1 026 bytes |

Against the `BTreeMap` these replace, over page-aligned `u64` keys of the shape
the DMA-window index uses:

| Live entries | `BTreeMap` key comparisons per lookup | Control-group scans per lookup |
|---|---|---|
| 64 | 8.1 | 1.000 |
| 1 000 | 12.2 | 1.001 |
| 100 000 | 21.7 | 1.032 |

The ordered map's cost grows with the log of the population, and each level is
a pointer chase to a node whose fill varies between a half and full. The
table's does not move, and its footprint is what the load factor alone
accounts for.

## Tests

Unit tests live next to the code. Beyond the ordinary map and set behaviour
they cover the portable scan against a naive lane-by-lane reference over every
adjacent-byte pair, every compiled vector candidate against the same reference
at every lane, churn through tens of thousands of tombstones with every
survivor still reachable and the footprint still bounded, and one drop per
value ever inserted across growth, overwrite, removal, retention, and an
abandoned owning iterator.

The intrusive list is gated on the same kind of number: a mid-list unlink
reaches the departing node and its two neighbours and writes exactly those
three links, identically over three nodes and over ten thousand. That is what
"constant time, no search" is, stated as something a regression shows up in.

The sequence tier's tests hold each container to the same bar: one drop per
element ever taken, across a bulk push, a wrapped drain, an eviction and a
spill; a footprint that is the elements plus their indices and no heap block;
and — for `ArrayVec::retain`, the one operation that moves elements out and back
— that a predicate which unwinds leaves the vector describing exactly what it
has written back, so the unswept tail leaks where a double drop would be
unsound.

`tests/fuzz_collections.rs` drives the map against a plain association list
over deliberately colliding key streams, the recency map against a naive
`(membership, order)` list — the same membership, the same victim on every
eviction, and an arena that stops growing once the churn's bound is reached —
and the range containers against a per-element set and a naive entry list over
`(base, count)` streams whose lengths are the ones a caller does not control: a
`mem_map` page count, a run off a foreign volume, and the counts that run past
the top of the key space. Those sweeps run at the bottom of the key space, deep
inside it, and hard against `u64::MAX`, so the arithmetic that must saturate
rather than wrap is exercised rather than assumed. `tests/fuzz_sequences.rs` drives the
sequence tier against naive models over arbitrary lengths and text — the
lengths are attacker-influenced by design, since a boot audit line carries
caller-controlled text into an `ArrayString` and a console ring takes whatever
a keyboard produces — and `tests/fuzz_intrusive.rs` drives two lists over one
shared store against naive order models, since a free list's link/unlink order
is whatever a process's allocation pattern makes it. All under
`cargo xtask fuzz`, and
`cargo xtask miri` interprets the whole suite under the undefined-behaviour
oracle — the table's `unsafe` core is why that stage exists. A test suite says
what the code computes; only an interpreter says whether a raw pointer stayed
in bounds, whether a slot was initialised before it was read, and whether two
`&mut` ever aliased.

## Stability

**experimental.** The public API may change until the first tagged release.
