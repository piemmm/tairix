# `tairix-controls` — the shared Reactive Alloy control behaviour

Reactive Alloy is TAIRiX's GUI control design language
(`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`), and `lib/controls` is the single home for
its behaviour. A control is typed Rust state resolved against the shared
design tokens (`lib/theme`) and drawn through the shared rasteriser
(`lib/raster`); no application carries a second copy of a control's
behaviour. The crate lives in `lib/*` because its consumers — the compositing
window manager, the taskbar, and the graphical apps — may not depend on one
another.

## The theme chooses the face, not the caller

No control accepts a typeface. A control names the job its text does — a
`tairix_theme::TextRole` — and the active theme answers with the family, size,
and weight, converted to physical pixels through the one shared DPI scale
(`tairix_font::BitmapFont::for_role`, see
[Theming](../desktop/theming.md#typography)). Interface text resolves
`TextRole::Body`; window furniture (`TitleBar`, `WindowFrame`) resolves
`TextRole::WindowTitle`.

An application therefore *cannot* substitute a face of its own, so a menu,
button, or dialog reads as the desktop's own furniture wherever it is drawn:
inside the file manager, on the pinboard, or inside a terminal whose screen is
monospace. Passing the face in would have made the desktop's typography a
convention each application could break, and one of them did — the graphical
terminal drew the shared menu and settings sheet in its own monospace grid face
at the user's terminal text size, because that was the face it had to hand.

An application still draws *its own* content — a document, a terminal grid, a
label the shared controls do not own — in whatever face it needs. The rule
binds the shared controls, not the application's content.

Because the theme now owns the face, a plate that carries text is sized to
hold it: `Metrics::control_height` is a *floor*, not a fit. A theme may author
its ladder up to `Fonts::MAX_BASE_SIZE_PX`, well above that height, so a menu
row, rail item, dialog action, panel footer, and field row each take the
greater of the standard height and the line they draw. The shipped themes sit
under the floor and are unchanged.

A continuous control reports where its interaction *settled*, distinctly from
the values it took along the way: `Slider` answers `SliderAction::SetValue`
while the pointer is still down and `SliderAction::Settled` when the drag ends
(a key step, being one whole interaction, settles at once). Durable work — a
setting written, a document published, another process told — belongs on the
settle alone. Acting on every value change means acting once per pointer-motion
sample, which is how a slider ends up wired to a disk write.

Every one of them resolves its colours, metrics, corner radii, **and text
face** from the active `Theme` and `Scale` rather than a hard-coded pixel, hue,
or typeface, composes its appearance from the typed `state` vocabulary, and
emits a typed action for the owning service to authorise. Two control values compare equal exactly when
they would draw the same pixels, so a host can skip a repaint by comparing
what it is about to draw against what it drew last.

One control is drawn on *two* surfaces, and they draw different parts of it:
`TraySignal`'s compact capsule sits on the bar permanently, while its
instrument readout exists only while expanded. Whole-value equality therefore
over-reports for the capsule — a live value line the readout alone shows moves
it on every reading its owner publishes. `TraySignal::draws_same_capsule` is
the capsule's own gate, and it is exact rather than a hand-kept field list:
the glyph, composed state, and badge live in an inner value the bar paint is
the *only* reader of, so a field the capsule draws has to be added there to be
drawn at all. Byte-for-byte drift guards assert both directions — the label,
value, and action never move the capsule's pixels, and everything it does draw
always does.

`plate_rect(width, height, placement, viewport)` is the one placement rule for
every plate and everything that hangs where one would. A `PlatePlacement` names
the three values every caller carries together — the anchor region, the side the
plate prefers, and the clearance it leaves. The plate is bounded to the viewport,
opens on the preferred side, flips to the opposite one when that side has no room
(and the roomier one wins when neither does), then slides along the cross axis
and clamps. `Menu::anchored_rect` is its point case: a zero-extent anchor
opening trailing with no clearance, which is a context menu at a press point. So
a root plate, a slot-anchored icon-bar menu and a submenu beside its parent row
all read one piece of arithmetic rather than each deriving its own.

`ChainModel` is the one *model* a menu is built as: a plate title and a
parent-indexed list of `ChainRow`s, each carrying the id an outcome names, what
the row opens (nothing, a submenu, the desktop's information panel, or its
quick-entry field), why the row cannot be chosen (`ChainRow::explained` — the
seat shows it as a tooltip on dwell; a `MenuItem` has no way to carry it and
measures none, because a caption beside every disabled label made a plate as
wide as its longest excuse), and the `MenuItem` that draws it. The two are independent:
a row may carry an id *and* a child, so clicking it answers while arriving on
it opens. A desktop surface builds one in process; an
application's bounded wire declaration decodes into one
(`ChainModel::from_app_menu`), which is why the model lives here rather than with
the chain that renders it — its clients are not all in the process that owns the
chain. The wire model is a **bounded subset**, structurally: it has no field for
an authority state, so a decoded row can never claim that *the system* refused a
command (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §1.6).

### One setting, and the group it lines up in

A settings surface is a column of captioned groups of label/description/control
rows, and that shape is the `form` family's, not each application's. A
`FieldRow` is one setting: a leading label, an optional secondary description,
and a trailing slot holding one real `Toggle`, `FlagSet`, `ComboBox`, `Slider`,
`TextField`, `Button`, a read-only `Reading`, or a stated `Unmeasured` absence
of one. A `FieldGroup` is the captioned plate those rows sit on, with an
optional footnote beneath. Both compose the row chrome `ListRow` and `TableRow`
draw — the hover wash, the leading pressure and selection rails, the activity
seam, the trailing Signal Bead band, the focus ring — from the one shared
recipe in the crate's paint core, so a change to how a selected or refused row
reads cannot diverge between a list and a form. `FieldGroup::paint_plate` and
`FieldGroup::plate_radius` are the group's plate alone, for a surface that
must read as the same object as the groups beside it.

Four rules are the family's own, and each is what stops a settings pane lying
about the machine:

- **A row's disposition is the setting's.** `FieldRow::set_state` shares the
  row's enablement, authority and validation — exactly what decides
  actionability — with the control in its slot, so a denied or pending setting
  cannot hold an actionable control and a pane states a refusal by
  setting the *row* rather than remembering to set two states in step. A
  disabled row mutes; a denied one wears the Authority Mark in a band that is
  reserved either way, so becoming denied never moves the row's own control.
- **Room is given out control, label, description.** The slot is served first
  — never past half the row's content span, so a label always has room to be
  read — the label elides into what remains, and the description draws only
  while the label fits *whole*: once the setting's own name has had to be cut,
  a second cut line beneath it is noise. Words are what a narrowing row loses,
  because the control is what the reader came for.
- **A row that spells out its value restates it in place.**
  `FieldRow::set_description` changes the words beneath the label while the
  control keeps whatever press it holds, so a slider row naming the setting it
  sits on follows a drag without the drag being dropped. The height a row
  measures moves with its words, so the owner lays it out again before drawing.
- **The owner places the choice popup.** An expanded `ComboBox` list is drawn
  above every group, so a row cannot paint it — the group's later rows would
  cover it. `FieldGroup::popup_anchor` names the row and the slot to anchor the
  list to; the owner places it, hands it back through `FieldLayout::with_popup`,
  and paints it with `render_popup` once every group is drawn. Only the owner
  knows the viewport the list has to fit in, which is why it is the one thing
  the owner supplies: `FieldGroup::layout` takes that viewport and answers the
  whole layout — the group's slot column and an expanded slot's list, placed —
  so an owner laying its groups out independently carries none of that
  arithmetic itself.

A group may also carry a **badge** on its caption's own line
(`FieldGroup::with_badge`): the `StatusPill` naming the state of the thing the
group is about — a volume's health beside its name. The group places it rather
than the owner, because it is the only thing that can also take the room out
of the caption and out of the band's height; a badge an owner drew over the
band would sit on top of a long caption and overhang the first row instead of
sitting beside them. `FieldGroup::set_badge` puts one on or takes it off in
place, for a state that moves while the reader works — which rows of a
settings plate now differ from what is in effect — because rebuilding the
group to restate it would rebuild rows that hold a caret and a selection. The
capsule rides a band of its own either way, so an owner that sets one
re-measures.

A group resolves the one slot column its controls line up in
(`FieldGroup::slot_column`): the widest width any of its rows wants, or the
half-span ceiling when a row's control takes whatever column it is given (a
cramped slider cannot be aimed and a cramped entry cannot be read). Each
control answers that width itself — `Button::measured_width`,
`ComboBox::measured_width`, `Toggle::measured_width`,
`Checkbox::measured_width`, `FlagSet::measured_width` — so the column comes
from the controls' own layout rather than a second copy of it. A combo box
measures its *widest* choice, not the selected one, so choosing a different
value never resizes the field or moves the column. The group turns that back
into a size: `FieldGroup::natural_width` is the narrowest plate that seats
every measured control whole under the half-span ceiling, so an owner sizing a
window from its content opens it with every control readable.

An owner stacking several groups may lay them all out in one column — the
widest any of them resolves (`FieldGroup::shared_column`) — so controls line
up down the whole surface. The column is then an input to every question a
group answers about its rows (`measured_height`, `row_text_span`, `row_rect`,
`row_at`, `set_focus`), because it decides how much room a row's description
wraps into: a height measured in a group's own narrower column would reserve
too little and cut the description's last line.

A `FlagSet` is the slot for a small set of independent flags — the read,
write and execute bits of one permission class — on one line. Each flag *is* a
labelled `Checkbox`, so the set restates no box, press, focus ring, disabled
look or Authority Mark; it owns only the layout that seats the flags side by
side, which flag the pointer is over and which holds a press, and which the
keyboard rests on. Each flag keeps room after its label no smaller than the
Signal Bead band, so a flag marked denied does not stamp the bead over its own
label. In a slot too narrow for every flag whole, the boxes keep their size and
the labels share what is left, eliding through the checkbox's own mark.
`Left`/`Right` walk the flags and clamp at either end; `Space`/`Enter` toggle
the one the keyboard rests on. The row's refusal is every flag's, like any
other slot's.

A row reports what the control in its slot asked for and commits nothing
itself. `FieldAction::SetValue` is a slider's live value and
`FieldAction::Settled` its settle point; a durable change — a document posted,
a store written — is made on the settle alone. `FieldAction::SetFlag { index,
on }` names the one flag of a `FlagSet` that changed, so the owner commits that
flag and leaves its siblings alone. The motion that takes the pointer off a
slot's control still reaches it, so the control's hover look leaves with the
pointer.

Groups stacked down a surface are one **plate column** (`stack`): a gap above
and beside each plate, every plate at its natural size, `stack::height` for
what they need together, and `stack::column_width` for the column a plate
needs. A column taller than its surface is laid out whole and shown through a
`ScrollView`, so a plate the edge crosses is drawn cut rather than dropped. It
is the one placement the Settings panes, the storage cards and the file
manager's Permissions section read, so none carries its own copy of the gaps.

A setting whose choices are pictures — a wallpaper, a screensaver — is a
`PictureChoice` seated in the group beneath its rows
(`FieldGroup::with_pictures`): one of several pictures, each drawn at one
fixed `Aspect` (`Aspect::WIDESCREEN`, the screen's own shape) inside a rounded
rim with its name beneath, wrapping into lines under optional section titles
through the shared `GridRun` arithmetic. The owner hands each picture over
already rendered at `PictureChoice::picture_size` — a control never decodes an
image — and one not yet arrived, or rendered at a size the choice no longer
draws, shows its built-in glyph on a quiet ground, so the choice is never
blank. A `Swatch` is a choice that is a flat colour, which the control draws
itself: a fixed colour, or the empty desktop's colour in whichever theme it
is drawn with. The picture is blitted through `Surface::blit_rounded`, so its
corners are the same coverage every rounded fill uses. The chosen picture
wears the accent ring — the accent panel under a heavier contrast — and the
keyboard's cursor the focus ring. The choice is the group's item after its
rows: a `FieldGroupAction` naming row `rows().len()` is the choice's,
`FieldAction::Selected` when a picture is chosen and `FieldAction::Browsed`
when its cursor moves, which an owner showing it through a scrolled view
answers by revealing `FieldGroup::focus_rect`, the one picture the cursor is
on. The arrows walk the pictures a picture or a line at a time, crossing from
one section into the next, and clamp at either end so the group can carry the
cursor on; Up from the first line steps back onto the last row.
`PictureChoice::for_each_item_rect` lays the choice out once for an owner
asking of every picture — which it renders ahead, which it lets go.

While a row's choice list is open it alone sees the pointer: the list hangs
over the rows beneath it, so a press on the list never reaches them. A row or
a plate the surface admits nowhere paints nothing, and each remembers what its
description and footnote measured for the span and faces it was asked at, so a
long column shown through a `ScrollView` wraps its words once rather than on
every pointer sample and costs only what shows.

### Scrolling

A scrolling view counts in physical pixels: its content is laid out at its
natural size, unscrolled, and the viewport rests at any pixel of it.
`ScrollView` is the one mapping between that layout and the window. `paint`
confines a paint to the viewport and shifts it by the offset, so nothing is
ever drawn at a negative coordinate; `to_content` maps a window point into the
layout and `to_window` a layout rectangle to the part of it that shows;
`report` turns a control's layout damage into window damage, dropping what
does not show. `event_in_layout` maps a pointer move the same way, and parks a
pointer outside the viewport one pixel before the content's start along the
scrolling axis while keeping it across that axis: a control never hovers or
arms a part the reader cannot see, and a slider dragged into the gutter beside
a scrolling column still reaches its end. `confined_to` is the same scroll
confined to a wider window, for an open choice list hanging out of the
viewport, which holds the pointer until it resolves.

`ScrollModel::in_pixels` steps a view's own line — its row pitch — and pages a
viewport less one line; `revealing` is the least scroll that shows a span,
which is how a keyboard cursor keeps its row in view. The wheel arrives in
scroll units, `SCROLL_UNITS_PER_DETENT` to a detent and already accelerated by
the seat; `wheel_steps` is the one conversion to a view's own steps, carrying
what is short of a whole step so a slow turn is never lost, and dropping the
carry on a reversal. A view moves `WHEEL_STEP` logical pixels a detent,
whatever its rows are; `ScrollBar::wheel` applies that with the carry in the
bar and reports the bar, and a wheel over the bar itself scrolls it. The
owner reports the content it slid.

### Where a drop-down's list goes

`ComboBox::popup_rect` is the one placement rule every expanded choice list
goes through, so a list opens the same way wherever a combo box sits: below
its field where the surface has room, flipped above it where it does not, and
never past an edge of the surface it has to fit in. It is the shared plate
rule `plate_rect` — the same arithmetic a menu plate and a submenu are placed
by — over the control's own `popup_size`, rather than a copy per owner. A
field in a footer therefore opens upward without its owner knowing it is
special: there is simply no room beneath it.

Present-day consumers: the widget gallery's Forms tab, the Settings panes, the
Date & Time window's two groups of three civil fields, and the file manager's
Permissions section — an access group of one `FlagSet` row per permission
class over an ownership group.

### Reporting a reading, and standing beside a list

The families a monitoring surface is built from report state without acting on
it, or frame the content that does:

- `MetricTile` is one at-a-glance report of a resource: a quiet label, a large
  reading with a quieter unit, an optional detail line, and an optional
  `MetricInstrument` beneath it — nothing, a `Track` proportional to the
  current level (a `MeterValue`, tinted by the tile's resource kind, whose
  unmeasurable case draws the bare groove rather than a fabricated zero), or a
  `Trend` `Chart` of its recent history, never two instruments for one number.
  A series is read against the chart's own scale: a permille fraction of the
  resource's capacity by default, or the ceiling `Chart::with_full_scale`
  states. A *count* has no capacity to be a share of, so a caller plotting one
  says what the top of the box means rather than leaving a reader to assume.
  A `Chart` claims the whole box it is given, because a series confined to a
  track's thickness cannot rise more than a pixel or two whatever it reads.
  A chart's series is tinted by a **`SignalRole`**, not by a resource pressure:
  a resource-identity trace passes `PressureKind::signal_role()` and reads
  exactly as its rail hue, while a signal that is *not* a resource under load —
  a task census, a direction of transfer — names its own role. A rate with two
  *directions* — read/write, receive/send — is one reading, so it takes an
  optional opposing series: the box splits at a drawn axis, the primary series
  rising above it and the opposing one mirrored below **in that direction's own
  tint**, so a glance says which way the bytes went. Giving both halves one
  role draws one reading in one colour and says nothing. Adding an opposing
  series asserts that direction is measured; a direction with no reading behind
  it is left off, so the chart stays a single-series trend over the whole box
  rather than showing an empty half as a quiet nothing.
  A chart's filled area fades out at the zero line it is read against: a flat
  fill draws the floor as a second hard edge, which reads as a measurement the
  chart never took. The ramp is the *band's* rather than the trace's, so the
  fill's weight at a given height means the same thing whatever the reading is
  there, and a mirrored opposing band ramps the other way.
  `MetricLayout` picks the anatomy: `Stacked` puts the label above the reading
  for a tile with a column of its own, `Inline` puts the label leading and the
  reading trailing so a narrow stack of readings can be scanned down. The
  reading's *value* may name its own `TextRole` (`with_value_role`, `Body` by
  default) so a hero leads with a loud figure against a quiet unit: the two are
  aligned on the baseline they share, and the tile's reported heights and icon
  slot grow with the taller line. A tile takes no input and reports nothing.
- `StatusPill` is the compact capsule that names a state in a word, toned by
  its signal role, for a place a full tile would not fit. A resting pill
  collapses its rim onto its fill; an `outlined` one draws it in its own tone,
  for a pill *badging* a dense grid — a core's performance class in the corner
  of its cell — where the wash alone is a few levels off the plate behind it
  and reads as nothing.
- `CompositionBar` splits a measured whole into its named parts: one
  proportional band through the very same measured-track geometry a tile's
  `Track` draws with — at `composition_thickness`, broader than a progress
  line, because each run has to be identifiable against the key under it —
  then a key naming each part and its amount. The parts separate by *hue* — a
  fixed rotation of the theme's resource colours led by the bar's own
  resource — because they are categories rather than degrees, and the joins
  between them are ruled so they stay countable where hue carries nothing.
  Only the band's two **outer** ends are rounded: a part that meets another
  ends at a straight edge, because a rounded cap there lets the next part's
  colour through above and below the join and reads as a curved wedge rather
  than a division. Shares that do not account for the whole are a `CompositionError` at
  construction rather than a silently short bar, and the part that is *not* in
  use is declared as the composition's `remainder`: drawn in the track's quiet
  neutral as the unfilled tail, last, and still named in the key. The key wraps
  rather than dropping an entry, so `measured_height` takes the width it will
  be given.
`CredentialSheet` is the one surface that asks for an account and its
password so a more-privileged program can be started as that account. Two
places on the desktop ask that question — the session, when a command it may
not perform is chosen, and Settings, when a machine setting is applied by
re-running the tool that owns the store — and they may not depend on one
another, so the wording, the focus order, the "an empty field is never
offered" rule and the secret's hygiene live here once. It knows nothing of a
compositor, a window, an account database or IPC: an owner gives it events
and a rectangle, takes back a painted surface and a `CredentialAction`, and
performs the exchange itself. The password is held only in the masked field's
bounded, pre-reserved buffer, which zeroises every byte it discards including
on drop.

- `FactList` is a column of key/value readouts with the values right-aligned
  on one another: the value keeps its room and the label gives way first,
  elided with the shared mark, so a narrow detail pane loses a word of
  description rather than a digit.
- `Timeline` is a vertical spine spanning only its first to its last mark,
  with shape-coded `EventMark`s and a stamp column sized to the widest stamp,
  so a reader can tell one kind of event from another without colour.
- `Breadcrumb` is the location trail: its trailing crumb is where the reader
  is and is deliberately not activatable, and a trail too long for its bounds
  elides oldest-first through one activatable ellipsis, so the current
  location is never the crumb that gets dropped.
- `Toolbar` is a horizontal strip of tool controls in groups. A strip with no
  room for every tool **scrolls in whole tools** rather than running off its
  own edge: it seats only tools that fit inside the bounds it was given,
  reserves one tool slot at each end for the overflow affordances (reserved
  whether or not one is currently drawn, so scrolling moves the tools and not
  the band they sit in), and holds the offset as a `ScrollModel` over the
  shared scroll engine, so the clamp is the same one every scrollbar uses. A
  chevron is drawn — and pressable — only where there is something that way,
  and a strip wide enough for every tool reserves nothing. A press steps one
  tool, a held press auto-repeats on the owner's one-shot timer through
  `Toolbar::repeat` at the cadence `REPEAT_DELAY_NS`/`REPEAT_INTERVAL_NS`
  every press-and-hold stepping control shares, a wheel detent over the strip
  steps it one tool (part of a detent carrying into the next), and a keyboard
  focus move scrolls the tool it lands on into view. An owner that must never scroll its strip floors its window on
  `Toolbar::natural_width`; one that may, on `Toolbar::min_width`.
- `ActionRail` is the vertical counterpart of `Toolbar`: a column of `Button`
  commands anchored beside content, so plate, role, disabled, and denied
  rendering are not restated per surface. It lights the Edge Wake described
  below down its own leading edge while the content beside it is scrolled.
  Every item it holds is re-seated `ContentAlign::Leading`, so the icons and
  labels of the whole column line up and the rail reads as a list of commands
  rather than a stack of centred captions; the rail imposes that on the items
  it is given, so two rails cannot disagree. A standalone `Button` keeps the
  centred default.
- `TableHeader` gives the row family sortable column titles over the same
  column-width model `TableRow` lays its cells out with, and reports the sort
  its owner commits rather than reordering anything itself. A header and a row
  reserve the *same* fixed leading rail gutter and the *same* fixed trailing
  Signal Bead band, both sized from the surface alone: a bead paints inside a
  band that is always there, so a row that becomes denied or gains a recovery
  mark keeps every column exactly where the header names it.
- `TableRow::cell_rects` answers where a row's cells are laid out, in the
  coordinate space of the bounds it is asked about and derived from the very
  span `render` draws with. A composer placing its own content inside a column
  — a sparkline beside a number — reads the layout rather than re-deriving it,
  so the two can never disagree. It returns one rect per cell it could seat,
  and fewer (or none) when the bounds cannot seat them all.
- `TableCell` carries an optional leading `IconKind` naming what its value
  *is*, taken the way `MetricTile` takes one. The icon draws on a fixed slot
  ahead of the text whatever the cell's alignment, out of the text's own
  budget; a column too narrow to seat it omits it rather than overlapping the
  text, and it never moves a column boundary.
- `TabsOrientation` gives the existing strip a vertical orientation, so a
  sidebar of pages is the one selection control rather than a second one. That
  vertical form is a *sidebar list*: an entry's label leads with its live
  reading trailing on the same line, an optional bounded `Chart` trend draws
  beneath, and a quiet group heading may introduce the entry that starts a
  group — declared by that entry, so a heading can never point at one that is
  not there. Entries **stack** at their own content height rather than sharing
  the column, so one with no rate behind it is visibly shorter than one
  carrying a trace, and `Tabs::measured_height` states the height the whole
  list wants: a discovered list longer than its column is the owner's to
  scroll, never the strip's to squeeze or truncate. A horizontal strip has one
  row and draws none of the three; a reading belongs in its label there.
  Because a vertical entry's rectangle depends on the theme's own metrics, the
  hit test and every damage-reporting entry point take the scale and theme the
  strip was laid out with, exactly as `ActionRail` does.
- **A list longer than its column is scrolled by its owner, in pixels.**
  `Tabs::measured_height` states the height a whole list wants; the owner lays
  the strip out that tall, unscrolled, and shows it through a `ScrollView`, so
  an entry the column's edge crosses is drawn cut and still answers where it
  shows. Every band is laid out, and a band the surface admits nowhere is
  skipped at paint.
- **A sidebar list may be two levels deep, and it is still one column.** An
  entry that holds pages of its own is declared with `Tab::with_disclosure`,
  which draws a trailing chevron stating that entry's own posture — down when
  its pages are shown, right when they are not — and each of those pages is an
  entry declared `Tab::nested`, drawn indented by exactly one glyph slot so it
  lines up with the label of the entry that disclosed it. They are ordinary
  entries in every other respect: one cursor walks the whole column, each is
  hit-tested and selectable, and no index means anything special. What
  *choosing* a disclosing entry does is the owner's — the strip states the
  posture and nothing more — which is what lets one strip hold a list whose
  sections both select a view and open their pages. The strip answers the tree
  keys a two-level list needs: Right on a closed entry and Left on an open one
  report `TabsAction::Disclose` for the owner to apply, Right on an open entry
  steps onto its first page, and Left on a page climbs back to the entry that
  disclosed it. A refused entry refuses them as it refuses a press. The rule is
  `tree_step`, beside `DisclosureSet`: it reads each row as a `TreeRow` — its
  disclosure posture and whether it is a page — and answers a `TreeStep`, a
  disclosure to apply or a row to move to, so every two-level list takes the
  one rule and applies the answer to its own model.
- **Sections open independently, everywhere.** `DisclosureSet` is the one model
  of which sections of a list open in place are showing their pages: every
  section starts in one posture, open or closed, and moves on its own, so
  opening a second section never closes the first. It records only the
  sections a reader has moved, keyed by whatever names a section (`Ord`), and
  `reset` puts them all back. The Settings sidebar and the program library's
  folders both keep one, so neither carries an accordion policy of its own.
- **A group may be set apart by a break instead of a heading.**
  `Tab::with_group_break` puts a blank band half an entry's line tall above the
  entry that starts a group — for a list whose runs a reader recognises without
  naming them. It draws nothing, is never hit-tested, and shifts no index; a
  break with nothing above it draws nothing, and a horizontal strip draws none.
  The layout and `Tabs::measured_height` read one walk of the stack, so the
  height an owner reserves is always the height the strip lays out.
- **A sidebar entry may lead with an icon.** `Tab::with_icon` names the kind;
  `Tabs::render` resolves the picture through the owner's `IconArtwork` lookup
  at `Tabs::icon_side` — the theme's `sidebar_icon_extent`, taller than the
  line of text beside it — so a strip of icons costs a cache lookup per entry
  rather than re-rasterising vector art every frame, and an owner holding no
  cache passes `NoArtwork` and each icon is rasterised in place. A strip that
  carries icons gives every entry, a disclosed page included, one row tall
  enough to seat the icon with a control gap's clearance, so the column keeps
  one rhythm. Room is claimed in the order a reader needs it: the Signal Bead,
  then the chevron and the reading, then the icon, then the label, which is
  what gives way — so a row too narrow for its icon keeps its name rather than
  becoming a nameless indent. A label or reading that gives way is elided through the
  shared `paint_run` recipe, mark included, so a cut name never reads as a
  complete one.
- **The two orientations carry selection differently, because one is a row and
  the other is a page shape.** A sidebar entry is a row: selection lifts it to
  the raised fill and marks its *leading* edge at the shared rail breadth,
  the pointer or keyboard cursor takes the shared hover wash — deliberately not
  that fill, so a cursor can never imitate selection — and a resting entry is
  simply the ground it sits on. It therefore needs no focus ring, and draws
  none: a ring around the selected entry would be a third selection mark and
  the loudest thing in the column. Its label stays the plain foreground for the
  same reason. A horizontal tab has neither a lift nor a leading rail to carry
  selection, so it keeps the accent label, the lower seam at the seam breadth,
  and the ring that distinguishes its keyboard cursor from a hover. A group
  heading reads in the accent at the header role's size in either form, so a
  break in the list is never mistaken for one more entry's label.
- **The keyboard cursor is the reader's, not the sample's.** `Tabs::restate`
  carries it across a refresh alongside the pointer's hover and press latch,
  and drops it with them when the run of entries gains, loses or re-orders one.
  A host that re-derived it from its own selection each sample would snap a
  reader's cursor back the moment a live reading moved.
- A group with *no* entries states why, through `Tabs::with_absences`. A
  heading is declared by the entry that starts its group, so a group with
  nothing in it has nothing to hang one on and simply vanishes — leaving a
  reader unable to tell "there is no such thing" from "this session was
  refused the list". A `TabGroupAbsence` carries the heading, one line under
  it, and the item index it is drawn *before*, so an empty group appears in
  its own list position rather than after everything. It is not an item: it
  selects nothing, is never hit-tested, takes no keyboard cursor, and does
  not shift any item's index — so `TabsAction::Selected`, `Tabs::len` and
  every selection entry point still count entries alone and a statement drawn
  among them cannot move what a press lands on. `Tabs::measured_height`
  includes them. A horizontal strip has no group headings and so states none.
- `Tabs` keeps where the *pointer* rests and where the *keyboard cursor* is as
  two separate records: both lift their tab's plate, and only the keyboard's is
  ringed. A monitoring host re-states where its keyboard is every time its
  model refreshes — many times a second — so one record for both would erase a
  resting pointer's highlight on each refresh and blink it as the pointer
  moved. A strip whose labels carry a live reading is therefore re-labelled in
  place (`Tab::set_label`) rather than rebuilt: a fresh strip knows neither
  record, nor where the pointer is, nor which tab is holding a press.
- A strip whose *entries* come and go — one per device, per volume, per
  interface — adopts each sample through `Tabs::restate`, which takes the fresh
  entries, absences, selection and cursor and keeps the records only the strip
  holds. The pointer coordinate survives whatever the entries became, since it
  is where the reader's pointer is rather than a claim about the sample; the
  hover and the press latch each name one entry, so they survive an unchanged
  run of entries (a moved reading does not disturb them) and are dropped when
  the run gains, loses or re-orders one. Assigning a freshly built strip over a
  live one instead hit-tests the next press against the origin, swallows a
  press already waiting for its release, and drops the lift from under a
  resting pointer on every sample. It answers whether the strip's drawn state
  moved, which is the host's repaint gate for the column it sits in.

## Plate seating: a panel or a bar

Where a control sits decides whether it wears chrome of its own.
`state::PlateSeating` is that one fact, and it is a property of the *surface
behind the control* — never of what the control is or what it is doing:

- `Panel` (the default) — the control always wears its Alloy Plate and Signal
  Rim, so it reads as a plate raised above the window or panel behind it.
- `Bar` — the control wears **no** rim in any state, and no plate at all while
  it has nothing of its own to state. A run of icons therefore reads as one
  continuous bar rather than a row of boxed buttons.

One state model, one renderer, and one resolved set of colours serve both. The
whole consequence is a single shared rule (`paint::FrameColors::face`), so no
family can grow its own idea of a flat control: a bar-seated control's rim
collapses onto its plate, and the quiet *resting* frame — the one frame in which
a control carries no role colour, no disposition, no pointer and no keyboard —
drops the plate entirely.

Nothing about the control's feedback is discarded, only moved off the edge:

- A **hover** raises the plate as the shared pointer wash (`surface_hover`), and
  a **press** compresses it (`surface_pressed`). For a rimless control the wash
  is the *only* pointer feedback there is, which is why `lib/theme` owes it a
  visible step away from the bar's own fill and asserts that separation on both
  appearances.
- **Keyboard focus** keeps the resting fill and takes the ordinary focus ring,
  so focus never reads as hover — and a bare frame is by construction never a
  focused one, so the ring can never be dropped along with the plate.
- A **disposition** (denied, failed-closed, pending, disabled) states itself on
  the glyph tint and its shape-coded Signal Bead rather than a coloured edge, so
  it stays legible without colour vision. A *missing capability* is stated in
  the warning amber and a policy refusal in the denied red — one shared
  resolution read by every family's rim, label, mark and bead — because a
  reader who could acquire the authority should not be told the same thing as
  one who may not. The Authority Mark's shape is unchanged either way, so the
  distinction never rests on colour alone.
- Activity and pressure use the marks the control already owns: the Heat Seam,
  the Pressure Rail, the bead. An icon-bar slot states no *window* state at
  all: it is an application, and windows are shown in the picker
  (`shell::WindowPreview`).
- Focus Field membership (below) is the one signal a bar-seated control cannot
  make, because membership is drawn only as a lift of the rim. A Focus Field
  groups a row with its own actions inside a panel, and the icon strip has no
  such groups.

A focused control shows **exactly one accent line, and it is the ring**, drawn
a border inside the plate. Its perimeter keeps the quiet resting rim — under
the pointer too, where a hover would otherwise lift it — because a ring with a
second accent edge around it reads as a doubled border rather than as one mark.
What tells focus from hover is therefore *where* the line sits, not its colour,
and the pointer still states itself in the plate wash. A rim carrying a role or
a disposition (a destructive edge, a pending check) is that control's own
statement and is never demoted for the ring.

`IconButton` is the only family that carries the choice (`IconButton::seated`),
because it is the only one that appears on both kinds of surface — a window
toolbar and the desktop's icon strip. `shell::TaskbarItem`,
`shell::WindowPreview`, `shell::TraySignal`
and `window::WindowControl` exist only on a bar — the desktop's icon strip and a
window's title band — and are bar-seated by construction; everything else is
panel-seated. That is why a window command shows a hover as a plate wash and
never as an edge: an edge on a command would read as a line drawn round the
window's corner.

A window command's wash is its **own** colour rather than the shared
`surface_hover`: red for close, yellow for minimize, green for the size toggle,
blue for put-to-back, each a `Palette` role authored at half opacity so the
title bar reads through it. That is a fourth emphasis in the shared plate
recipe (`paint::resolve_tinted_frame`) — a colour that appears only under the
pointer, so the control still wears nothing at rest the way every other
bar-seated one does, and keyboard focus still states itself on the ring alone.
A disposition outranks it: a denied or disabled command reads as denied or
disabled, never as its own colour. Because a plate is *laid down* rather than
composited, the renderer resolves the authored translucency against the band it
is seated in first (`Palette::title_band`, `Rgba::over`); laying the raw value
down would cut a hole through the window's furniture strip instead of tinting
it.

A window command is also seated **flush**: its cell fills the band's height and
touches its neighbour, so the wash covers every pixel a press can land on. The
outermost cell in each cluster sits where the window's rim curves, and rounds
that one corner to match it (`BandCorner`). A plate is a single rounded
rectangle, which rounds all four corners, so `paint_flush_plate` draws it
*larger* than the cell in the directions whose corners must stay square and
clips back to the cell — one fill, exactly one rounded corner, and the focus
ring still measured from the cell so it cannot end up shifted off an edge.

`WindowFrame::render` lays the furniture in one order: the rim, its bevel, the
plate, the title bar's marks, then the band's foot. The bevel is lit from the
upper left — a ring as wide as the frame border round the rim,
`Palette::bevel_light` where the edge faces that light and
`Palette::bevel_shade` where it faces away (`Surface::wash_ring`,
`RingInk::Bevel`). The rim already lights and shades the band's top and sides,
so the band adds only its foot, one border deep in `bevel_shade` where it meets
the client; every bevel line is one border wide, never two side by side. Laid
after the marks, the foot runs unbroken under a lit command, and both are
washes, so the rim's neutral and a hue-washed band are lit alike. Under heavy
contrast the active frame's inner rim line is a solid ring on the plate's own
corners.

## Surface ground: opaque, floating chrome, or a frosted window

Seating says what a control sitting *on* a surface wears. The **ground** is its
counterpart: whether the backgrounds drawn with a theme cover what is behind
them or let it through. It is `tairix_theme::SurfaceGround`, and it rides on the
theme a surface is drawn with (`Theme::floating`, `Theme::frosted`, reported by
`Theme::ground`) rather than on each control, so everything drawn on one surface
agrees without any of them being told separately — and none can be forgotten
and left an opaque patch.

- `Opaque` (the default) — backgrounds are the palette's own colours and hide
  what is behind them.
- `Floating` — desktop chrome over a backdrop the compositor blurs by
  `chrome_backdrop_blur`: a background keeps its colour role and takes the
  palette's chrome alpha for its layer, so the wallpaper and the windows behind
  read through as a wash of their colours.
- `Frosted` — an application window cut from the same glass: its own ground
  takes `chrome_alpha` over the same blur, while everything laid on it — rows
  and plates alike — stays solid, so the content the window shows never reads
  through to the desktop. The Switchboard and Settings are drawn this way.

Adopting it belongs to whoever puts the surface on screen, the only party that
knows what is behind it. On the desktop that is the session, which draws the bar,
the four popups it opens, every menu plate, and every control on them with the
registry's floating form (`ThemeRegistry::active_on`), so they are translucent by
construction; a frosted window takes the registry's frosted form and asks the
compositor for `Theme::backdrop_blur`, the one blur its ground reads over. What a
frosted window draws over its *own content* — a choice list, a menu, a sheet —
is not on the glass and keeps the opaque theme: laid down translucent, it would
show the desktop through the window instead of what it covers. A floating
surface keeps the role it wears when solid — the bar, a menu plate and the tray
readout ground in `surface_raised`, a `Panel` in `surface` — which is what
preserves the relationships the theme authored: a resting row still matches its
panel, a hover wash still steps away from it.

`ground_fill(theme, fill, layer)` is the one rule, and `ChromeLayer` is the only
choice a call site makes: `Ground` for the surface's own ground; `Inlay` for a
background laid flush into it (a list row, a menu row, a sidebar entry, a
scrollbar channel, a heading band) — the ground's weight on floating chrome,
which is what keeps a resting row exactly its ground rather than a patch on it,
and solid on a frosted window; `Plate` for a control raised on it (a button, a
text field, a page tab, a card, a settings group) — a step more solid on
floating chrome, solid on a frosted window — so it reads as furniture standing
on the glass rather than a hole cut in it. A row takes the layer of what it sits
on: a setting row is part of the group card it is listed on, so it is `Plate`,
and a row tint laid at the ground's weight inside a solid card would punch the
glass through it.

Two rules keep it honest. **Only backgrounds pass through it**: a semantic mark
— a role fill, a menu's highlighted command, a pressure rail, a Signal Bead, a
focus ring, a control's own Signal Rim — stays solid, because it has to read
against whatever wallpaper is behind it, and a mark diluted by the backdrop is
one a user can miss. A *surface's* own rim is the exception that proves the
rule: it is that surface's edge rather than a mark on it, so it takes the
surface's layer and reads as the same glass one step lighter (one step darker
on a light theme) instead of a hard line the wallpaper cannot reach through — and
a solid card's edge is solid.
**A background is laid down, never composited**: composited over
the pass beneath it, a translucent fill comes back more opaque than the theme
authored and the surface frosts nothing, while an opaque colour covers either
way — the same byte wherever the shape fully covers a pixel, and one rounding
rather than two on a corner arc — so this is the ordinary path too rather than
a second one for chrome. One translucent layer per surface follows from the
same arithmetic: a floating `Panel` draws no header band and states its header
with the rail and title it already has.

`paint_surface_plate(surface, rect, (radius, border), theme, (fill, layer))` is
the recipe every surface's own background is drawn by — the rim as a rounded
ring, then the ground inside it, reporting the interior the caller draws into.
Two siblings cover a surface that is more than a ground.
`paint_titled_surface_plate` caps the plate with a heading band in
`Palette::title_band`, laid by the plate itself and rounded by the plate's own
top corners — a band laid square over a rounded plate is a second anti-aliased
shape on the same arc, heavier than the silhouette — which is what a menu plate
is drawn by. `paint_framed_surface_plate` lays the ground square, lets the
caller draw controls that do not know the surface's shape, and lays the rim
*last* as the plate's edge (`Surface::frame_ring`), so what they drew survives
only inside it, cut with one anti-aliased edge: the icon bar, whose end slots
are ordinary plates hard against its rounded ends. A mark laid flush inside a
plate — a row highlight, a `Panel`'s header band and rail, a menu row's focus
ring — is clipped to the plate's interior shape rather than laid square, so at
the first or last row it follows the plate's corners. Nothing these recipes draw
reaches past the plate's silhouette, which is what lets the compositor take such
a surface as already rounded rather than cut its arc a second time
(`Corners::Painted`, [the window manager](../desktop/wm.md#rounded-corners)).
They are public because the taskbar *is* such a surface without being a control
in this crate, and `plate_border` beside them is the one rim thickness the whole
desktop states its edges at, so a surface painted outside this crate cannot
invent a second.

## Owner-supplied icon artwork

Seven controls draw an image whose pixels their owner may already hold
rasterised: a `shell::TaskbarItem`, a `shell::WindowPreview` (its window's
scaled frame), a `shell::TraySignal`, a
`collection::IconTile`, a `collection::ListRow`, a `button::IconButton`, and a
`window::TitleBar` (its owning application's identity icon). Each offers the
same pair — one query and one parameter:

- `icon_side(bounds, scale, theme, …) -> u32` reports the exact pixel side
  the control's icon slot will be drawn into, and `0` when the geometry leaves
  room for none. An owner asks its cache for artwork at precisely that size
  rather than guessing one and rescaling at draw time. A control that gives
  its whole face to an icon sizes it off the **plate** — the smaller plate
  dimension, less its border and a twelfth of the plate on each side, so the
  icon fills about 83% of it and stays clear of the frame. The clearance has
  one definition, so no control can wear a picture out of scale with the
  others beside it.
- `render(…, artwork: Option<&Surface>)` blits that artwork centred in the
  slot when it is supplied and rasterises the control's built-in vector glyph
  when it is not, so a missing, refused, or undecodable asset always degrades
  to a meaningful icon instead of a blank slot (`AGENTS.md` §10).

The rule lives once, in the crate's shared paint recipe
(`paint::paint_icon_slot`), so the six controls cannot drift apart
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). Artwork whose surface does not match the slot is centred
on it rather than pinned to a corner, so a size mismatch reads as an even
margin instead of a lopsided drawing; a control that reserves no icon slot
ignores the parameter entirely. A control never decodes an image — artwork
reaches it already decoded and rasterised through the desktop's sandboxed
asset path (`AGENTS.md` §19.5), so a malformed file can only fail to produce
artwork, never reach a drawing path.

The recipe **blits and never rasterises**: the owner's cache resolves both a
shipped decode and a built-in glyph's coverage once per (picture, pixel side)
and hands the control an `IconPicture` — artwork to composite as it is, or a
mask to composite tinted. A control given no picture at all (`NoArtwork`: a
headless build, a test) draws the glyph inline through the same mask-and-tint
arithmetic, so a cached icon and an uncached one are the same pixels.

The recipe also takes a **saturation** factor, which pulls each artwork pixel
toward its own luminance as it lands (`Surface::blit_desaturated`, the one
saturation definition in `lib/raster`). It is how a control states that what its
artwork identifies is not the thing in hand: a `window::TitleBar` keeps nearly
all of the colour while its window is active and none of it while it is not, so
an unfocused window's icon goes grey with its muted title. Every other control
asks for full colour. The built-in glyph is never touched — it is a theme tint,
with no application colour in it to reduce — and because the reduction happens
on the way in, an owner still caches one full-colour copy per (asset, pixel
side) rather than one per state.

## The icon-view tile

`collection::IconTile` is one item of an icon view — a picture with its name
beneath it — and it is what the file manager's grid and the desktop's icon field
are both made of, so the two cannot drift into lookalikes.

A resting tile draws **only** its picture and its label: no plate, no rim, no
rail. That is the point of the control. An icon view is a field of many items,
and a plate per item would put a box around every icon; whatever lies behind the
tile — a window's surface, or the desktop wallpaper — shows through instead. A
`Card` is the opposite case and keeps its plate: a card's plate bounds the one
group of state and actions it owns.

Only state paints anything behind the picture, and each state uses the mark the
language already owns for it: the shared pointer wash for hover and press, the
selection fill for a selected tile, the shared focus ring for the keyboard, and
the shape-coded Signal Bead for a denied or unhealthy item. Nothing a tile draws
escapes its bounds, so a view may lay tiles edge to edge — and bound the whole
grid's paint to the area it owns — without a tile bleeding onto its neighbour.

A **selected** tile draws neither the pointer wash nor the focus ring, whatever
strength its mark is currently drawn at. The selection itself suppresses both,
not the mark's strength: an outline that appeared for as long as a mark took to
arrive read as a border flickering on and off under the pointer. The ring is
there to tell a *focused* tile from a hovered one, so an unselected tile still
takes it.

What a selection blurs is the **backdrop**. The pixels the tile covers — a
window's surface, the desktop wallpaper — are frosted by the scaled
`selection_backdrop_blur` through `tairix_raster`'s one shared region frost, the
same call the compositor frosts a window's backdrop with, and the theme's
`selection_fill` — its accent at three tenths opacity — is then laid over them with a
**crisp** edge, rounded like every other control plate. Frost and fill are both
confined to that one rounded shape, so nothing lands outside the tile and no
square edge shows around the rounded fill. Softening the *fill* instead leaves a
smear with no shape of its own, which is why the blur belongs behind the mark
rather than on it.

The radius is short, and deliberately so. A box blur of radius `r` averages
`2r + 1` samples, so a radius approaching the tile's own size averages its whole
backdrop to a single colour — the mark reads as a smudge with an accent cast and
the wallpaper behind it is gone. The frost must take the backdrop's fine grain
and leave its larger shapes legible, which is a rendering property rather than a
number: one test requires a one-pixel pattern behind the mark to collapse, its
pair requires a broad one to survive, and together they bracket what the theme
may state. The pair measures across the *middle* of the tile, because the frost
stops at the tile's edge and replicates the pixel there, so the outermost columns
keep their own colour whatever the radius.

Because the fill lets the frosted result read through it, the
tile's name keeps the theme's ordinary foreground, which separates from that
result whichever way the theme is lit; the near-white `on_accent` ink is
reserved for the one mark that is an opaque plate. Under a heavier `Contrast` the
tile fills that crisp opaque accent panel, unfrosted, and inverts its ink: a
translucent wash over a blurred backdrop would trade away the very contrast that
policy exists to add. Only a selected tile pays for the frost, and it pays for
it once per repaint rather than once per frame.

`IconTile::with_selection_fade` draws that mark at a given strength, `0` to
`u8::MAX`. It is what lets an owner cross-fade a selection as it moves between
items, over the theme's `MotionInteraction::SelectionChange` duration. It scales
the frost and the fill together, so a backdrop never snaps into focus ahead of
the colour leaving it. The item being left is already unselected while its mark
decays, and the item arrived at is already selected while its mark grows, so the
strength is the owner's to state rather than the composed state's to infer. It
is set independently of
`with_state`, in either order, and a host that does not animate sets nothing.
Under a heavier `Contrast` the panel does not fade at all — it arrives with the
selection, because a half-arrived plate under inverted ink is exactly the
contrast that policy exists to guarantee — and a reduced-motion theme reports a
zero duration, which settles the change immediately with no second code path.

The name wraps rather than being cut. `paint_label` lays it out over as many
whole lines as the band under the picture holds, each centred in the band's
column, and elides the last with the shared ellipsis when the name runs past
them; a band with no room for one whole line draws nothing rather than clipping
a glyph. `IconTile::label_lines` reports that budget from the same geometry the
render lays out to, so an owner sizing its tiles — the login chooser sizing an
account tile so a two-word display name is not elided — asks the tile instead of
re-deriving its label layout.

`IconTile::with_label_shadow` draws that name, the eliding ellipsis included,
through `lib/font`'s one soft shadow, every line's shadow laid before any
line's ink so a wrapped name's second line never shades its first. It is for a
tile whose ground is a
picture rather than a colour the theme knows: a resting tile paints no plate, so
the login chooser's account names sit straight on the wallpaper. A tile that
sets none draws exactly the pixels it always did.

A tile renders state and never dispatches. The view owns the grid geometry and
hit-tests pointer input against that same geometry, so a tile carries no pointer
position or press latch of its own, unlike a `ListRow` or a `Card` — controls
the user clicks directly.

## The card: a group that can be chosen

`collection::Card` is a grouped state-and-actions surface: a dominant state on
its leading edge, progress along its bottom, a count or alert bead at its
top-trailing corner, a title and optional body line, and a row of footer action
`Button`s.

A card reports two different interactions, and the distinction is what makes a
master/detail screen work:

- A completed click on a footer button reports `CardAction::FooterActivated`
  with that button's index. The footer buttons always see a pointer event
  first, and they keep their own pointer and focus states, so hovering one
  action does not disturb the card.
- A completed primary click on the card's **own body** — inside its bounds and
  clear of every footer button — reports `CardAction::Pressed`. That is how a
  master list of cards is selected with the pointer, which is what the
  Switchboard's Pressure, Recovery, and Background screens are built on. A
  click can never report both: the body press is considered only once no footer
  button has claimed the event.

A press does **not** give the card a look of its own. Feedback for choosing a
card is the owner marking it *selected*, not a hover or press wash, because the
card's composed state is the owner's to set. The pointer position and press
latch are therefore hit-test input only: they are excluded from the equality
comparison, so a card mid-press still compares equal to its resting self and a
host using `==` as its repaint gate is never woken by a click that changed no
pixel.

A card that is not actionable — disabled, or denied by authority — reports
nothing at all, for the body press exactly as for a footer button. The body
press runs through the same fail-closed press latch every clickable control
shares, so there is one rule rather than a second one written for cards.

## Grouped focus and anchored edges

Two of the design language's reactive state patterns describe a *relationship
between controls* rather than the state of any one of them, so both are
resolved in the crate's shared paint recipe and inherited by every family
instead of being drawn per surface.

### The Focus Field

`FocusState` carries two independent facts: whether a control holds the
keyboard, and whether it belongs to a group whose **Focus Field** is
highlighted. A row of related controls — a list or table row and the action
buttons that act on it — is one such group: the member the keyboard is
actually on takes the focus ring, and every other member states its
membership by lifting its rim part-way toward the active rim. Both members of
the row family carry the mark, so a table whose commands are a column groups
exactly as a list beside a rail does.

The lift is partial by design, so a member never looks like the focused
control; a control that is *both* focused and a member simply takes the ring,
because the language draws one or the other and never both on the same
control. A filled plate is left alone: its rim is its plate colour by
construction, and tinting one without the other would put a foreign edge on a
coloured control. Under a high-contrast theme the lift goes all the way to the
active rim — contrast comes before glow, and a partial blend would wash out.

Membership is the *weakest* claim a rim can carry. A disabled, denied,
needs-capability, failed-closed, or pending control keeps the rim its
disposition gave it and draws identically whether or not its group is
highlighted: each of those is telling the user something they need far more
than which row a control belongs to, and a control that cannot be actioned
must never look livelier than a resting one that can. Only an ordinary
interactive control — including one merely awaiting confirmation, which is
still actionable and still takes its plain role emphasis — is lifted.

### The Edge Wake

An anchored control that content scrolls past does not move, which leaves a
still frame ambiguous: did the column stay put, or is it merely where the rows
left it? The **Edge Wake** answers that on the control's edge. An `ActionRail`
anchored beside a list lights its own leading edge (`ActionRail::with_edge_wake`)
for exactly as long as the content beside it is displaced from its start.

It is a state, not an animation. There is nothing to fade, so a reduced-motion
theme needs no second path and a screenshot carries the same information as a
live surface. The seam is drawn at the shared seam breadth in the active rim
colour, doubled under heavy contrast like every other edge in the theme. A
section whose items are cards has no wake: a card draws its own footer actions
inside itself, so no anchored column stands beside the list.

## Text that does not fit: wrap it or mark it

Two things a control can do with text it has no room for, and which one is
right is decided by what the text *is* — not by the control it sits in.

**Prose wraps.** A sentence cut at the box's edge is a sentence the reader has
to guess the end of, so every run of prose the desktop draws is laid out over
the lines its box holds: a dialog's message and its inline reason, a
notification's and a card's body, a tooltip and a help tip's reason, a
setting row's description and its group's footnote, a field's validation
message, a tab group's stated absence, and an icon's caption. All of them go
through one recipe — `paint::TextBlock`, the multi-line sibling of
`paint_text_line` — over the one shared fitter in `lib/font`
([`wrap_to_width`](./font.md#fitting-text-to-its-box)), so no control writes a
break loop and none can disagree about where a line ends.

**An identifier does not.** A name in fixed-height chrome — a button's label,
a menu row, a tab, a table cell, a window title, a breadcrumb, a list row's
title, a metric's reading — stays on one line and ends in the shared ellipsis
mark. Wrapping one would move everything laid out beside and beneath it, and
a name is scanned rather than read: the mark says the rest is there, which is
all the reader needs. Every such name is drawn through one recipe —
`lib/font`'s `elide_to_width`, then `paint_run`, with `run_width` to align it —
and the crate exports both, so an application drawing a name of its own ends
it in the same mark rather than cutting it where its room ran out.

**Wrapping makes a height depend on a width**, which is why the controls that
carry prose ask for one: `Dialog::height_for_content(content, width, ..)`,
`Card::measured_height(width, ..)`, `Notification::measured_height(width, ..)`,
`FieldRow::measured_height(span, ..)` and `FieldGroup::measured_height(width,
column, ..)`. Each measures through the very block its paint draws, and the paint is
bounded by the room it was actually given, so a surface sized by the
measurement draws exactly what it reserved and a surface given less elides
rather than spilling. A tooltip and a help tip have no owner to ask, so they
cap themselves at the typographic **prose measure** (`PROSE_MEASURE_COLUMNS`,
56 characters of the face's own column width) instead of growing a plate
across the screen.

**Every prose block is bounded.** A message, a body, a description, a footnote
and a statement each take at most a stated number of lines, and the excess is
elided. These are containment bounds, not capacities: a notice's body is
another program's text, and no one notice may push every other one out of the
popover however much it has to say.

## The multi-line text box

`TextArea` is the text-entry family's multi-line member. It shares
`TextField`'s plate, page ground, caret, selection, read-only/denied/
disabled/validation rendering and typed `TextAction`; what differs is that its
text **wraps at the box's own width** rather than scrolling sideways. That is
the whole reason both exist — a single-line field holds a value and scrolls,
and a box that holds a paragraph wraps it, because a paragraph read through a
one-line window is not read at all. There is no horizontal scroll and no wrap
toggle.

- The caret and the selection work in the lines a reader *sees*: Up and Down
  move between visual lines and keep the column they set out from, Home and
  End go to the ends of the visual line, Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End to the ends of
  the text, PageUp and PageDown by a viewport, and Shift extends the selection
  with all of them. A click lands on the character nearest the pointer on the
  line it fell on, clamped to that line's visible text so a click past the end
  of a line does not land on the next one.
- **Enter inserts a newline** and reports `Edited`; it does not submit,
  because in a box that holds paragraphs Enter is a paragraph. Escape still
  reports `Cancelled`.
- It scrolls vertically and shows that it does: the caret is kept in view as
  it moves, the wheel and the page keys move the viewport without moving the
  caret, and a text longer than the box grows the shared `ScrollBar` in a
  trailing gutter. The gutter is taken from the text's own column only when
  the text overflows — and narrowing the column can only *add* lines, so the
  decision settles in one pass and cannot flicker.
- The layout is `lib/font`'s tiling one, so every caret position resolves to a
  line and back with no "between lines" case to defend against, and only the
  lines the viewport shows are laid out.
- There is **no masked mode**. A credential is a single value, so masking
  belongs to `SecretField`; a multi-line masked box would be a credential
  nobody could check.

### The ground a field is written on

An **editable** field — enabled, allowed, not read-only — draws its plate on
`Palette::document`, the ground a document's own content is drawn on: paper on
a light appearance, the deepest layer on a dark one. The ground is the
affordance, so a field the user may type in reads as a page while a read-only
one recesses onto the window ground (`Palette::surface`) to read as a value
shown rather than entered — keeping full-contrast text, so it is still not a
muted disabled field.

Neither substitutes a plate the shared recipe put a *colour* on: a disabled,
denied, or failed-closed field is stating something there, and a page ground
would erase it. The recipe answers which of its arms carry a plain background
(`FrameColors::grounded_on`), so a role-filled plate — whose label is resolved
against that fill — is never swapped underneath. Both grounds go through
`ground_fill`, so a field on floating chrome is a plate on glass at the theme's
plate alpha rather than an opaque patch on a frosted popup.

A hovered field states nothing on that page. The pointer over a text surface is
reported by the seat's own text cursor and by the field's rim, not by washing
the page it is written on; the focus ring is drawn inside the plate as always.

## Masked text entry

`SecretField::new(max_len)` is the credential entry — a password, a
passphrase, a PIN. A `SearchField` has no masked mode: a query is not a
credential. The plate, rim, focus ring, validation rim, Authority Mark,
read-only, disabled and denied rendering, and high contrast are every text
field's. The control offers no way to reveal the buffer.

### The console's marker, never the secret

Once a character is in, the field reads `[input active.]`, its dots cycling
`.` → `..` → `...` on the cadence every text-mode password prompt uses, and
`[input complete]` once the secret is submitted. The marker is
`tairix_vt::secret`'s own state machine, so a desktop password field and a
console prompt say the same thing on the same clock. Nothing the field draws
depends on the characters typed or on how many there are, so the rendering
leaks neither — where a row of beads would still give away the length. An
empty field shows its placeholder: a placeholder is not a secret.

Editing is the line discipline's: a printable character appends, Backspace
erases the last, Enter submits (`TextAction::Submitted`) and Escape cancels.
Nothing moves the caret or selects, because an edit nobody can see is one
nobody can check; a press takes the field's pressed look and places nothing.
The first edit after a submission begins a new secret, which is what the
marker then drawn says.

### The owner keeps the time

The dots move on the owner's clock, never a timer of the control's own. Each
key is handed over as a `Keystroke` — the key, the modifiers, and the
monotonic instant the owner took it at. The owner parks no later than
`SecretField::deadline_ns` and calls `advance(now_ns)` once that passes, which
steps through every frame due and answers whether the field must be
repainted. The animation runs for three seconds after the latest keystroke and
then freezes, so a field left alone arms nothing; under reduced motion no
deadline is armed at all. `FieldRow`, `FieldGroup` and `CredentialSheet` fold
their fields' deadlines and advance them, so a container's owner asks once.

### The buffer is reserved once, up front

A masked entry is inseparable from its character bound, and the bound is the
reason. It lets the editor reserve the worst case UTF-8 needs for `max_len`
characters at construction, so the buffer can never grow while it fills. A `String` that grows copies its contents to a fresh allocation and
releases the old block with everything typed so far still written in it — a
copy of the credential that no later erase can reach, because nothing holds
its address any more. Reserving the whole capacity up front means there is
only ever one copy to erase.

### Discarded bytes are erased

Every path that drops buffer content — replacing the text, overwriting a
selection, clearing, truncating to the bound, and the editor's `Drop` —
overwrites the bytes it discards before releasing them. The erase is the
workspace's shared `tairix_util::secret::wipe` rather than a plain fill: on
the drop path the bytes are freed immediately afterwards and nothing reads
them back, so an ordinary store is dead by the language's own rules and a
release build is entitled to delete it outright, leaving the plaintext in the
released block. The shared wipe writes volatile and fences, so the erasure
survives optimisation.

The erase runs for a plain field too. It is cheap, it is harmless, and one
editor is better than two. A `SecretField`'s `Debug` output prints the
character count in place of the buffer, so a diagnostic dump cannot carry a
password.

## A hover has to be able to end without the pointer moving

Every clickable family derives its hover from `inside` — the caller's hit test
of the pointer against the control's bounds — so an ordinary hover ends when a
motion lands outside. That is not the only way one ends. When something is drawn
*over* a control the pointer stops resting on it without moving at all, and
hit-testing its unchanged position answers "still inside": the control stays lit
under whatever is now in front of it, advertising a press that would no longer
land on it, and any surface the hover opened is stranded on screen.

Occlusion is not a fact a control can see, so it is told. The composite
controls whose hover a host cannot otherwise end carry a **`pointer_left`**:

| Control | What ends |
|---|---|
| `WindowControl` | the command's hover wash (any press latch is left alone: a latch is only held while a button is down, and a held button holds the pointer) |
| `TitleBar` | the hover of whichever command was lit, reported as that one cell |
| `TraySignal` | the hover, which collapses the instrument readout unless the keyboard is holding it open |

Each is the guarded write and nothing more, so being told twice reports
nothing, and each damages exactly what it unlit. The desktop's input seat is
what calls them — see [the session](../desktop/session.md#routing-one-seats-input-to-the-taskbar-and-the-window-manager).

## The repaint account a host carries between reporting and painting

A control reports its own repainted bounds into a damage sink; the host has to
carry that answer from the input round to the paint. `damage::Repaint` is that
account, one per host-composed surface: `Whole` — every pixel, which is what a
change to the *model* owes, because a rebuilt list or a new label has no
rectangle smaller than the surface — or `Parts(region)`, the rectangles owed in
the surface's own pixels, an empty one meaning the surface on screen is current.
`merge` composes two accounts (everything outranks a rectangle either way) and
`area(w, h)` resolves one into the region a paint runs over, so "whole" is
turned into a rectangle in exactly one place.

It lives here rather than beside either consumer because it is the same account
for every host-composed surface: the desktop's menu plates and the icon bar's
five surfaces read one definition. `damage::paint_parts(surface, rects, paint)`
is the other half — it lays the host's whole recipe under each rectangle as a
clip, so a scoped repaint lands exactly the pixels a whole paint would have laid
there and no second "paint just this control" recipe exists to disagree with the
first. That holds because a plate *lays its colour down* rather than compositing
it (see [Surface ground](#surface-ground-opaque-floating-chrome-or-a-frosted-window)), which
makes re-deriving a rectangle idempotent; a rectangle whose corner is not
addressable names no pixel of the surface and is skipped rather than painted
somewhere else.

## Where it sits

`#![no_std]`, and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The crate depends only on other
`lib/*` crates — `tairix-geometry`, `tairix-theme`, `tairix-raster`,
`tairix-font`, `tairix-icon`, `tairix-input`, and `tairix-util` for the shared
secret erase — and never on `kernel/*`, `drivers/*`, or `userland/*`, so the
desktop depends on it and never the reverse.
