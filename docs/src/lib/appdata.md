# `tairix-appdata` — the app-data client

`lib/appdata` (`tairix-appdata`) is the one way an application reaches its own
settings (`plans/APPDATA.md` §3.9). An app opens its store once, reads every
setting out of the document it already holds, and publishes the changes it made
as one atomic commit.

```rust
let mut host = RtHost;
let mut settings = Settings::open(&mut host, "terminal");
let size = settings.u32("font.size")?.unwrap_or(14);
settings.set_u32("font.size", 16)?;
settings.commit()?;
```

## Five scopes

`Settings::open` is the application's **private** scope: the user's settings for
it, which no other principal can read. `Settings::open_published` is its
**published** scope — what it says about itself for other applications to read —
and `read_published` reads another application's:

```rust
let mut mine = Settings::open_published(&mut host);
mine.set("font.family", "berkeley")?;
mine.commit()?;                                     // now readable by others

let theirs = read_published(&mut host, "os.tairix.terminal")?;
let family = theirs.get("font.family");
```

The two are separate documents with separate commits, because one atomic publish
replaces one document. A foreign read answers a plain `tairix-appconf`
`Document` — a snapshot, with the format engine's own typed accessors, and no
handle that could publish through it.

`Vault` is the **sealed** scope: the application's secrets, encrypted at rest by
the [service](../userland/confd.md) under a key derived per (account,
application).

```rust
let mut vault = Vault::open(&mut host)?;      // one call, whatever it holds
let saved = vault.get("imap.password");       // local
vault.set("imap.password", typed)?;           // sealed before it returns
vault.unset("smtp.password")?;
```

It differs from the other two scopes in three ways, and each is the sealed
scope's own:

- **No layer beneath it.** A secret an application did not write is not one it
  may be made to believe, so there are no bundle-shipped defaults and no
  machine-wide policy. An `unset` leaves the key absent rather than uncovering
  something else.
- **No staging and no commit.** The service seals and publishes each write
  before it replies, so nothing is ever left unsaved — and because the service
  serves requests one at a time, two instances of one application sealing
  different secrets cannot lose each other's. A write ends by re-reading, so the
  handle reflects what the service holds rather than what the client guessed;
  that is the same rule `commit` follows.
- **Opening can fail.** `Settings::open` degrades to the shipped defaults;
  `Vault::open` returns the refusal, because "I could not read your secrets" is
  not "you have none". An application must report a damaged vault rather than
  behave as though the user had never saved a password.

The handle holds the opened plaintext, so it wipes it when it goes out of scope
— and so does the format engine, for every line a document discards, and so
does each read of the transport buffer it was answered out of. The userland heap
does not re-zero freed bytes, so a buffer left holding a secret would hand it to
whatever allocated that memory next.

`blobs` is the durable **bulk** scope, and it is not a document at all. An
index, a cache, or a queue is reached as a *descriptor*, so its bytes never
cross the app-data channel:

```rust
let handle = blobs::open(&mut host, "mail.index", BlobMode::ReadWrite)?;
let index = File::from_delegation(handle)?;   // an owned descriptor
index.write_at(0, record)?;                   // straight to the kernel VFS

let held = blobs::list(&mut host)?;           // one call, whole listing
let used = bulk_quota(&mut host)?;            // both bulk scopes, one moment
blobs::remove(&mut host, "mail.index")?;
```

`open` answers the grant *handle* rather than an owned descriptor, because
installing one is a syscall and this crate is I/O-free by design so the whole
client stays host-testable; `File::from_delegation` is the owned redemption and
closes the descriptor on every path out. Redeeming it needs no filesystem
capability of the application's own: the delegation is exercised under the
service's captured authority.

`BlobMode` decides both what the delegation conveys and whether an absent blob
is created — `Read` refuses one the application does not hold, `ReadWrite`
creates it — so "create but do not write" is not a request that exists. What the
delegation conveys is *bounded*: a writable one carries a byte-extent ceiling
the kernel enforces on every write and truncate through the descriptor, so
direct access is not unbounded access. `bulk_quota` reports usage against that
ceiling and against both count ceilings, so an application that reaches any of
them can say "this cache is full" in its own terms rather than surfacing an
errno. It answers for both bulk scopes at once, because one deciding whether to
spill to scratch or evict a cached index must not read two moments.

`list` costs exactly one call, always: the widest listing that can exist is a
few kilobytes, so it asks for that outright rather than negotiating a capacity
the way a document read must.

`temp` is the **scratch** of one run, reached the same way — and it differs from
`blobs` in who names the file:

```rust
let scratch = temp::create(&mut host)?;       // a fresh file, service-named
let spill = File::from_delegation(scratch.grant)?;
spill.write_at(0, page)?;
temp::release(&mut host, &scratch.name)?;     // done with it
```

`create` takes no name and there is no operation that *opens* a temporary file,
so the only way to hold one is to have just created it: an application can never
read scratch it did not write in this process, not even its own from an earlier
run. That asymmetry is the point — freshness without coordination is what a
scratch file is for, and two instances of one application that each chose
`"spill"` would corrupt each other.

The name it answers with is good for exactly one thing, `release`. Their
lifetime is the boot: a file an earlier boot left is reachable by nothing and is
reclaimed before the next is created. An application that releases what it
finishes with holds one slot at a time; one that never releases holds them until
the next boot, which is what the temp-count ceiling bounds — and it bounds
nothing but that application. There is no `Drop` that releases for you: this
crate is I/O-free by design, so a handle has no way to call the service when it
goes out of scope, and a release that only *sometimes* happened would be worse
than one an application states.

## No app spells a path, and none names itself

Nothing here takes a store path or a user, and nothing but `read_published`
takes a bundle **identifier**: the [app-data service](../userland/confd.md)
derives all of those from the identity the kernel attests for the calling task.
So an application cannot reach outside its own scope by construction rather than
by a check some caller might forget, and this library has no privileged surface
to misuse. The one identifier a caller does name selects a *published* document
and nothing else — there is no request shape that reaches another application's
private settings.

The one argument `open` does take is the program's own command **word**, and it
selects nothing but layer 1 below — the app's own shipped defaults. A wrong
value there can only mislead an application about itself.
`open_published`, `Vault::open`, and the `blobs` calls take none: none of those
scopes has a layer beneath it, and a blob is not a document.

## Three layers, and which of them this library owns

Layering is the **private** scope's. The published scope is exactly one
document: the service cannot name a bundle's own directory, so a shipped
published document could never be read by anyone else, and what an application
publishes is therefore exactly what it wrote.

A private read answers from the highest layer that sets the key:

1. `<Bundle>.app/DefaultSettings/settings.conf` — the defaults the bundle ships.
   **This library's layer.** It needs the *bundle's* path, and nothing attested
   gives the service one — `argv[0]` is caller data, and scanning the program
   stores for an identifier is a lookup that can disagree with what is actually
   running — while the app knows its own bundle with no lookup at all. It is
   resolved through the one shared bundle-resolution order (`tairix_cmdres`), so
   an app's defaults and its `man` page can never come from different bundles.
2. `/System/Settings/<bundle-id>/settings.conf` — optional machine-wide
   administrator policy. The service's layer.
3. The user's own document — overrides only. The service's layer.

Layers 2 and 3 arrive already merged, as one document, in one call.

## One call to open; reads are local; writes are published once

`open` does the one round trip. Every read after it is a lookup in memory, so an
application that consults forty settings issues no further calls — where a
per-key protocol would have cost the service a file read and a parse *each*.

Every `set` is memory too, until `commit` stages the keys that changed and
publishes them as one atomic document replacement. A handle that is never
committed changes nothing on the volume. Two things a `set` deliberately does
**not** do:

- stage a value the effective layers already carry, so an app that saves a
  setting it did not change does not rewrite the user's document; and
- copy a policy or default value up into the user's own file, which is what
  keeps that file holding only what the user actually chose.

`replace` is the operation a whole-registry publisher wants instead: it makes
the scope say **exactly** the document handed in — every key the scope carries
that the document does not is unset, every setting it carries is set, and the
lot lands as one commit — so a caller that renders its entire model each time it
changes does not have to work out which keys disappeared. `document` is the
mirror of it: the effective settings as one owned snapshot, layered exactly as
`get` answers them, in a form that outlives the handle. That is what a caller
needs to hand its settings across a thread boundary, which is how a settings
write happens off the surface that asked for it (`AGENTS.md` §28).

A commit ends by re-reading the store, so the handle goes on reflecting what the
service actually holds — which matters after an `unset`, where the effective
value comes back from a layer below rather than from the value removed. A
standalone `reload` is a fresh view, not a merge: it discards unpublished edits,
which is the contract a handle that is simply never committed already has.

A commit answers whether its edits landed. One whose re-read then fails still
succeeds, and `store_refusal` says why the view is not fresh; so a caller that
puts its screen back on a failed commit never shows a value the store — and the
next start — has already replaced.

## Closed registries, and the open namespace that needs enumeration

Most applications read a **closed** registry: a fixed set of keys they know, so
they read those and leave everything else alone. Such an application declares
its record as a `tairix_appconf::Registry` — its keys, their spellings, and the
bridges between a stored text and a field — and the engine does the rest once
for every application: `Registry::load` reads it through `Lookup`, which
`Settings` implements, so one loader serves the layered handle and the
`Document` a foreign read answers with; `save` writes only what the layers do
not already imply and replaces a stored value the registry refused; `clear`
removes the user's opinions; `loaded` reads it and names everything worth
saying about the read.

A settings *surface* keeps the record in a `Publication`: an edit changes the
live record and writes nothing, the settle asks for one write, carried out off
the loop by `publish`, and the store's answer is adopted wherever the user has
not edited since — a refusal reverts what the write carried and is stated, and
one write is outstanding at a time, the rest owed behind it. A program sees its
last write out before it ends (`Worker::wait`).

Some app data is an **open** namespace, though: a catalog, a recent-file list, a
set of per-host preferences. `Settings::settings` answers those, listing every
key the layers effectively carry, each once, with the value that wins. It costs
no call: the client already holds the document and parsed it, which is exactly
why the wire carries no listing operation at all — a paged listing can be
spliced out of two snapshots and a whole one cannot.

## Reading what another application publishes

`read_published` is the one call that names another application. It answers the
publisher's **committed** document — never its unsaved edits — and answers the
**empty document** for an application that publishes nothing, has never run for
this account, or whose store the service cannot attest. Those cases are
deliberately indistinguishable, so a caller learns what an application chose to
publish and nothing more.

An unreachable service or volume is reported as itself rather than as an empty
document, because only that is worth a retry. An identifier outside the
bundle-identifier grammar is refused by the wire codec, so a frame naming one
never reaches the service.

## No service, or no store: read the defaults, refuse the writes

`open` never fails, and neither does `open_published`. A store the service
cannot serve — early boot before the encrypted root is unlocked, a crashed
service, a caller the kernel admitted from no signed bundle — leaves the
bundle's shipped defaults standing (the published scope simply empty) and
records the reason in `store_refusal`. The application therefore starts and behaves, can say
why its settings are the shipped ones, and is never told a change was saved that
was not: the commit reports the same typed error, and the edits stay staged for a
retry.

`defaults_refusal` is reported separately, and only for a defaults document that
*exists* and could not be used — a packaging defect worth saying out loud. A
bundle that ships none is the ordinary case and reports nothing.

## Whole documents, never fragments

A read declares the reply capacity the caller has. A document that does not fit
comes back as the byte count it needs and **no body at all**, and the client asks
again at exactly that length. So a caller never parses a truncated prefix and
never assembles a store out of two snapshots — every answer is one point-in-time
view. The retry count is bounded, so a service that keeps asking for more is
given up on rather than chased.

## Layering and testability

The crate is `no_std` (with `alloc`) and the engine performs no I/O: its three
syscalls sit behind the `AppDataHost` seam, so the layered read, the capacity
negotiation, staging, the commit, and the sealed scope are all exercised on the
host against a fake that speaks the *real* `appdata-v1` codec rather than a mock
of it. `RtHost` (feature `rt`) is the syscall-backed one.

The fake does not *encrypt* the sealed scope — the sealing is the service's,
behind its own tests, and a fake that reimplemented it would be a second opinion
about a key hierarchy. What it reproduces is everything a client can observe: one
document, no layers, no staging, a write applied before the reply, and a refusal
that is a refusal rather than an empty vault.

The `key = value` format is not defined here: it has one home,
[`tairix-appconf`](./appconf.md), and this client applies the same validators the
service does — so a `set` outside the grammar is refused where the mistake was
made rather than at commit time.
