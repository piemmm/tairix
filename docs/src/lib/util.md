# `tairix-util`

The strictly justified shared-utility crate: every item here is used by
**two or more** independent crates (`AGENTS.md` §2.3, §3), and promoting
code into it requires a `PLAN.md` note naming those callers. `no_std`
(the C-locale engines use `alloc`; `fmt` and `size` are allocation-free)
and panic-free throughout.

## Members

* `conf` — the `#`-comment line grammar every line-oriented
  configuration store in the tree shares: `strip_comment` returns the
  portion of a line before its first `#`, leaving the surrounding
  whitespace for the caller to trim, so a blank result is a line
  carrying no setting. The boot-time system configuration
  (`lib/sysconfig`), the network configuration (`lib/netconfig`), and
  `userland/system/init`'s service registry and startup list all read
  that one definition, so a change to how a comment is recognised can
  never apply to some stores and not others. No store's keys or values
  may contain `#` — each store's own validators enforce that, which is
  what makes cutting at the first `#` unambiguous. `ValueShape` is the
  other half of that shared vocabulary: what a configuration key accepts,
  either a closed set of canonical spellings or a description of the free
  form its own parser admits. Both registries state it, and a tool
  refusing a value and a settings surface offering the choices read the
  same definition rather than each keeping a copy that would drift.
* `cfloat` — C-locale `printf(3)` floating-point rendering shared by the
  `seq` and `printf` command apps (`plans/APPS.md`): one `FloatDirective`
  (the five printf flags, width, precision, `efga`/`EFGA` conversions)
  rendering an IEEE 754 `f64` exactly as C's `printf` renders a `double`
  in the C locale — rounding, padding, alternate forms, special values —
  so the tools that promise printf semantics share one definition. A
  consumer whose GNU counterpart computes in `long double` documents
  that divergence at its own surface.
* `cnum` — C-locale `strtod(3)` scanning shared by the same two apps:
  `scan_double` reads the longest leading subject sequence (whitespace,
  sign, decimal or hexadecimal float, `inf`/`infinity`,
  `nan`/`nan(n-char-seq)`) with C's `endptr` measure, composing hex
  floats with exact one-step nearest-even rounding down to the
  subnormals — so `seq` demands full-token consumption and `printf`
  diagnoses a partial conversion over the one grammar.
* `fallible` — reserving a buffer whose size comes from the data before
  filling it, so a request the machine refuses is a typed refusal rather
  than an allocation abort. Userland's heap answers exhaustion with a
  null pointer, which `alloc` turns into a process abort, and a buffer
  sized by image geometry or a decoded payload — a window's surface is
  close to a megabyte — is exactly what a machine short of memory
  refuses. `filled` and `collected` reserve exactly what a one-shot
  buffer needs; `grow_to` reserves amortised for a scratch grown across
  uses, so repeated growth is not quadratic; `reserve` serves a buffer
  filled by pushing. The rasteriser's surfaces and resample plans
  (`lib/raster`), the compositor's scan-out frame and layer buffers
  (`userland/gui/wm`), and the PNG decoder's row and output buffers
  (`lib/image`) all reserve through this one definition, so a desktop
  under memory pressure degrades rather than dying in it.
* `fmt` — no-allocation numeric formatters that render task / port /
  capability identifiers into `lib/log`'s structured field values
  without touching an allocator on the hot path. Promoted from
  `kernel/sec` once `kernel/ipc` became the second caller; both consume
  it today.
* `size` — the GNU coreutils size vocabulary shared by the `du` and
  `df` command apps (`plans/APPS.md`): the `-B`/`--block-size` grammar
  (`512`, `1K`, `1MiB`, `1GB`, `c`/`w`/`b` byte suffixes, and the
  `human-readable`/`si` rendering words, parsed fail-closed into a
  `SizeScale`), ceiling block scaling (`blocks_ceil` — a partially used
  block is a used block, so usage is never under-reported), and the
  GNU `human_ceiling` renderings (`format_human`: one decimal below ten
  units, an integer otherwise, re-tiering a rounded-up amount, in
  powers of 1024 or 1000). Values are `u128` internally so a 100 TB+
  volume's byte totals can never overflow (`AGENTS.md` §26.6).
  Beside it, the *desktop's* prose rendering of the same quantity —
  `format_binary` (`512 B`, `1.9 GiB`) over `binary_scale` and
  `format_at_scale` — shared by the Switchboard's resource pages and the
  Settings storage pane, so one disk cannot read two ways. The two
  renderings are deliberately not each other's default: `df` is bound to
  the GNU spelling and its ceiling rounding, while a surface with room for
  the unit spells it out and truncates, because it reports what is there
  rather than what must not be under-reported. The ladder reaches `EiB`
  because a byte count is a `u64` throughout the ABI.
* `count` — the GNU count grammar for the `-c`/`-n` values shared by the
  `head` and `tail` command apps (`plans/APPS.md`): `parse_decimal`
  reads a plain digit run and `parse_suffixed` a digit run with the GNU
  multiplier alphabet (`b` = 512; `k`/`K`/`M`/`G`/… as powers of 1024, or
  of 1000 with a trailing `B`). A malformed spelling or unknown suffix is
  rejected as `None`; an in-grammar count beyond any possible input
  saturates at `u64::MAX` rather than wrapping, since a count larger than
  the input is served exactly by "all of it". The tool-specific sign
  handling (`head`'s leading `-`, `tail`'s `+`) stays in each tool.
* `secret` — the one definition of "the secret is gone": `wipe` overwrites a
  byte slice through volatile writes and fences afterwards, and `Wiped<N>`
  is a fixed-size buffer that wipes itself at the end of its scope. A plain
  `fill(0)` before the bytes are freed or reused is a dead store the
  optimiser may delete outright, so every credential buffer in the tree —
  the `lib/rt` elevation client, the shell's `elevate` builtin, the login
  supervisor's elevation broker, and the masked entry in
  `lib/controls` — erases through this one implementation rather than its
  own. Its volatile stores are why `cargo xtask miri` interprets the crate's
  suite, bar the three tests that hold `mathf` to the host's libm, whose results
  the interpreter perturbs on purpose.
* `defer` — the one way an interactive surface hands a piece of slow work to
  a worker: `JobDesk<Req, Ans>` holds one request waiting, one in flight, and
  one answer landed, and nothing about it blocks, locks, or performs I/O (the
  embedder supplies the exclusion and the parking). Two properties are why it
  is not a queue. **Latest-wins**: a submission made while a job is in flight
  replaces any earlier waiting one, so an interaction that settles repeatedly
  costs at most one further job — a queue would make the surface's own
  responsiveness the thing that generated the backlog. **At most one in
  flight**: two concurrent writes to the same store would race for what it ends
  up saying, so a job is handed out only once the previous one has been
  answered. An answer a newer submission superseded is dropped rather than
  delivered, and what a submission *displaced* is handed back, so a caller
  waiting on the displaced request can be told it was superseded instead of
  left waiting for an answer that will never come. The desk is only the
  bookkeeping; the exclusion, the parked worker thread, and the wake that
  reaches a loop's wait-set are `tairix_rt::work`, which every app-side
  consumer drives it through. Consumed by the terminal's settings publisher
  and the Settings application's applier (both via `tairix_rt::work`), the
  desktop
  session's settings publisher, the session's program-catalogue scan, and the
  file manager's bundle scan.
* `argv` — resolving a value-taking option's value from a command line,
  attached (`-u0`, `--uid=0`) or as the following argument (`-u 0`), so
  every GNU-shaped command app agrees on what a trailing `--uid` is. The
  caller names the usage error; the resolver reports only the absence.
  Consumers: `mount`, `passwd`, `useradd`, `usermod`, and `groupadd`.
* `mathf` — bounded, total `f64` maths for `no_std` geometry (`floor`,
  `sqrt`, `sin`, `atan2`, …) with no external libm, so the glyph
  rasteriser (`lib/fontface`), the SVG decoder (`lib/svg`), the raster
  engine, the audio engine, the desktop companion and WinterSun round and
  rotate identically, and on every target the same bits. The square root and
  integer rounding are the toolchain's correctly rounded forms — an
  instruction where the target has one, else the compiler runtime's routine
  (the SSE2 `x86_64` baseline has no rounding instruction) — so IEEE 754
  fixes their answer; the
  transcendentals are fdlibm's range reductions and minimax kernels in one
  fixed order with no fused multiply-add, within an ulp of the true value.
  An angle past 2^20 quarter turns is reduced by Payne and Hanek's method in
  integers, so every finite angle reduces exactly, however large. Every
  function returns a finite answer for every finite input, so no caller guards
  against a `NaN`.
* `retry` — the two retry schedules. `RetryLadder` is for waiting on
  something that has not appeared yet and has no readiness event: a
  bounded, doubling one-shot ladder, so a boot on which the thing never
  appears ends after the ladder's finite length rather than a poll loop.
  The clock service's configuration store and RTC, and the service
  manager's enrolment overrides, climb it. `RestartPacer` is for restarting
  something that keeps dying: a capped, doubling, saturating delay,
  forgotten once a restart stays up for a stable window. What fails may be
  killed on purpose by a crafted input, and restarting it at once would
  hand the sender a process spawn per input. The service manager's restart
  policy and `lib/sandbox`'s supervised worker pace through it.
* `tailwindow` — the bounded rolling "keep the last N bytes/lines"
  windows shared by the same two apps: `ByteWindow` and `LineWindow`
  retain only the trailing N units of a stream, so `head`'s `-c -N` /
  `-n -N` elide modes and `tail`'s `-c N` / `-n N` last-N modes are two
  policies over one mechanism whose memory cost is N, never the input
  size — a 100 TB+ file is a constant-memory read.

## How to grow the crate

Promoting code into `lib/util` requires a `PLAN.md` note documenting the
two-or-more concrete callers, an entry in the member list above, and
unit tests next to the new item per `AGENTS.md` §7.
