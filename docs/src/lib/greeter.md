# `tairix-greeter` — the authentication-surface engine

`lib/greeter` is the shared engine for every place TAIRiX asks a user to prove
who they are *at the screen*. It owns what such a surface is — one centred
column carrying the clock, the date, and the machine name, and under them
either the account tiles or the chosen account's disc, name, and masked field —
together with the wording, the geometry, and the state machine that turns a
keystroke into a verdict. It knows nothing of a compositor, a window manager, a
seat, or IPC.

Two consumers share it, and they may not depend on one another: the desktop
session's screen lock (`userland/gui/session/src/lock.rs`), which is this
surface with the account fixed to the session's own, and the graphical login
screen (`userland/session/greeter`), which starts at a chooser of the
machine's accounts. Two implementations of "prove who you are, at the screen"
is exactly the duplication the charter forbids, so there is one.

## The surface

`AuthSurface::new(login, shown)` names whose secret is wanted and goes
straight to the field; an empty `shown` name is headed with `UNNAMED_ACCOUNT`,
because failing to resolve a name must never be a reason to let anybody
through. That is the lock's constructor: a lock has exactly one account to ask
about, so it has no chooser and `Escape` does nothing.

The **two names are separate**, exactly as they are once a chooser tile is
picked: `shown` is what the person reads and what the disc's mark is taken
from, while `login` is only ever offered to the authority. That is why the
placeholder heading is never offered as a credential — it is display text, and
an account called "Locked" is not one anybody has. A caller holding only one
name passes it as both.

`AuthSurface::with_accounts(tiles)` is the login screen's constructor: it opens
on the chooser instead.

`on_event(event, ctx)` applies one pointer or key event, in the surface's own
coordinate space, and answers an `Outcome`: whether the frame on screen is now
stale (`redraw`), and whether the account was verified (`verified`). Keys edit
the secret and `Enter` offers it; the pointer places the caret within the
login-name field — the secret's never leaves its end — and reaches nothing
else. `EventContext` carries the monotonic clock the surface times motion
from, the secret marker's dots included.

`render(screen, scale, theme, backdrop)` paints the whole frame and yields
`None` — never a partial or empty frame — when a screen has no pixels or a
surface could not be allocated, so an embedder that must cover the display
fails closed on it. It is a pure function of state the surface already holds:
it reads no clock, so what is on screen is decided by `on_event` and `advance`
and never by when the paint happened to run.

## Motion

Four animations, each one `tairix_theme::Timeline` over a duration the theme
names. No timing is written down in this crate and no part of it keeps its own
start stamp, span, or frame step — that arithmetic has one definition, in
`lib/theme`, and this crate holds one timeline per concern so two that overlap
both finish.

| Animation | Theme duration | What moves |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| selection cross-fade | `SelectionChange` | the mark dissolving between two tiles |
| stage transition | `StageTransition` | the chosen disc travelling between chooser and prompt |
| rejection shake | `AttemptRejected` | the prompt column swinging sideways |
| the veil | `SessionFade` | the whole screen arriving out of black, and leaving into it — the one animation that moves no painted pixel |

`advance(now_ns)` steps whatever is running, settles what has finished, and
reports the union of what it touched. `motion_due(now_ns)` is the nanoseconds
until the soonest next frame — the minimum over what is running — or `None`
when nothing is, so an idle embedder arms no timer. Both fold every animation
in *every* mode: the shake and the veil live in the prompt, and the desktop's
lock is a surface that is only ever the prompt.

An animation whose span ran out since the last `advance` still asks, with a
frame due **now**: that frame is its settled end state, and an embedder spends
real time presenting the previous one, so the span routinely ends between the
step and the park. Answering `None` there would freeze the screen one frame
short of the end until some unrelated event woke it. It is `advance` drawing
that frame — settling the cross-fade and the veil the screen leaves through,
dropping the transition, the shake, and the veil it arrived out of — that makes
the surface idle, never the clock passing the end.

### The stage transition

Picking an account travels the chosen tile's monogram disc to where the
prompt's disc sits, growing as it goes, while the other tiles dissolve and the
prompt's name, pill, and notice come up. `Escape` runs the same transition the
other way.

It reports the **band** it redraws rather than the screen: the chrome, both
bodies, and the disc travelling between them, full width because a long account
name is centred across the screen rather than in the block. The disc needs no
term of its own — it is interpolated between two rectangles the band already
spans. That band is about a third of the screen's height, and every frame of a
transition pays the difference twice, once blitting the surface into the frame
and once presenting it. A unit test composes the transition over a matrix of
account counts and picked tiles and asserts that no pixel moves outside the
band, because a pixel that did would be left showing the frame before.

It interpolates the **layout**, not two renders: the disc's rectangle and glyph
size are interpolated between the two stages' own geometry, and every other
element is drawn once at a strength applied to its own colour, which every fill
and every glyph already honours. Cross-fading two screen-sized renders would
cost a second frame buffer for a quarter of a second to reach the same picture;
this costs one tile-sized scratch per chooser tile, and only while the
transition runs.

A single strength drives both the disc's position along that axis and its
opacity, in both directions. That is what makes a mid-travel reversal turn
round *where it is* rather than jumping to the mirror of it, and it is why both
stages composite in a fixed order — ordering them by which one is arriving
would swap them where they overlap and pop.

### The rejection shake

A refusal swings the prompt column — disc, name, and pill — sideways in a
decaying oscillation of three cycles that comes to rest at exactly zero. The
amplitude is authored in logical pixels, scaled once, and clamped to the room
either side so nothing is drawn off the surface at any point.

There is no float maths in a `no_std` kernel-adjacent crate, so the sine comes
from a nine-entry quarter-period table in 1/255 units, linearly interpolated
between samples and folded into the other three quadrants. A square wave would
have been cheaper and would have read as a stutter rather than a shake.

The damage is the union of the extreme positions the band reaches, never the
screen. The refusal notice and the authority's cooldown are untouched; the
shake is additional, which is why reduced motion — where there is no shake at
all — still reports the refusal in full.

### The veil

One veil runs both ways over the whole composed screen, so the screen a person
is shown and the screen they leave are the same black at the same weight.

**It changes no painted pixel.** The veil is a flat black field over
everything, so `reveal()` reports how much of the painted surface reaches the
screen and the embedder applies it where that surface is blitted into the
frame — `Outcome::paints()` is `false` for a veil step and nothing else. A fade
frame is then one blit of a surface that is already painted, instead of
repainting the backdrop, the chrome, both bodies and every glyph and its shadow
to change one number. The rounding error is dithered across the pixels the
field covers exactly as the wash that painted it in did, so what a fade
presents has not changed by a byte.

`begin_entry_fade(now_ns, theme)` starts it opaque and opens it off over
`SessionFade`, before the first frame is presented. A greeter is spawned onto a
display the desktop handed over cleared to black, so without it the chooser is
*cut* onto that black rather than appearing out of it; at first boot the same
first frame covers the text console's pixels in one step. `begin_session_fade`
is the other direction — it darkens to opaque, and `session_fade_finished()`
says when it has arrived. The embedder drives both, because the embedder is
what knows the screen is coming up or the login is over; the surface is what
paints.

Only the leaving half is modal. Input is ignored once it starts: the decision
is made, and a keystroke must not re-open the prompt. A screen that is still
*arriving* answers everything, because somebody may pick an account and start
typing while it comes up — so `session_fade_begun()` is direction-aware, and
both things that must stop when the screen is leaving read that one definition.
The second of them is the pointer: an embedder that draws one over this surface
stops, because the veil is applied to what is *under* the cursor — as the wash
painted into the surface was — so a cursor sampled over it would stay bright
all the way down to black. A pointer is an affordance for a screen that is
still answering, and a leaving one is not, so it leaves with the screen rather
than being dimmed by a second copy of the veil's arithmetic.

A secret accepted while the screen is still arriving leaves from the strength
the veil had reached, rather than restarting at nothing and flashing the screen
bright before darkening it. The arriving veil is let go the frame it uncovers,
so an arrived screen pays nothing for having faded in; the leaving one is kept,
because its owner holds the black until it exits.

### Reduced motion

A reduced-motion theme reports zero for every duration, and a zero-duration
`Timeline` starts already settled. Every animation above therefore becomes
instant with no branch in this crate: the transition lands on its destination,
the refusal shows its notice with no displacement, the leaving veil is black at
once, the arriving one is over before it begins and owes no frame at all, and
nothing asks for a frame.

## The verdict seam

The surface holds no credential store, no key, and no authority. It asks
through `Verifier`, which answers one of three things:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `Verified` | the secret belongs to the account — the only answer that lets anybody through |
| `Refused` | a real answer about a real secret: it is not the account's |
| `Unreachable` | no answer could be obtained — nothing listening, a transport fault, a reply that is not this protocol |

A refusal and an unreachable authority read differently on screen ("wrong
password" and "I could not ask" call for different reactions from the person
at the keyboard) but conclude identically: still asking.

`verify` is told the login name the surface is currently asking about. The
login screen forwards it to the session authority; the desktop's lock ignores
it, because its broker attests the caller's identity from the kernel and checks
the password against *that* uid — a name on the wire could not weaken it, and
is not consulted. A test injects an answer directly, which is what lets the
whole surface be exercised on the host without a kernel.

## The chooser

A surface built `with_accounts` opens on a centred row of account tiles — a
monogram disc, the display name, and a badge on any account that already has a
live session — and moves to the secret field for whichever is picked. The disc
is the shared `tairix_icon::monogram_disc`, the same one the desktop's own
account capsule on the icon bar draws, so the mark a person signs in as is the
mark they then live with. The row
wraps into a grid only when the screen cannot hold it, so a grid where a row
would do never reads as a list. `Escape` returns to the chooser and wipes
whatever had been typed.

A tile's height comes from `IconTile::label_lines`, sized so the band under
the disc holds three whole lines at the reference density and at a doubled
one. That is capacity rather than layout — a one-word name still draws a
single line — but "System Administrator" wraps instead of being cut, and a
face wider than the reference one has a line to fall onto rather than being
broken mid-word.

An `Other…` tile is always present and always last, even when the list is
empty, and leads to a typed login name. It wears a disc bearing an ellipsis in
the quiet plate colours, so it reads as a peer of the accounts rather than as a
leftover while staying plainly not one of the listed people. An account the
chooser could not be told about therefore stays reachable, and a machine whose
account list could not be read is still a machine somebody can log in to.

The whole surface is operable from the keyboard alone: `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` and
the arrow keys move focus with wrap-around, `Return` activates. The tiles are
`lib/controls` `IconTile`s, so the login screen looks and behaves like the rest
of the desktop rather than being a second visual vocabulary.

## The attempt cooldown

`set_cooldown(remaining)` shows the authority's per-account lockout and makes
the surface refuse to offer a secret while it is running — a submit re-states
the wait rather than reaching the verifier, and erases what was typed, since a
lockout can outlast the user's patience. The engine invents no budget and reads
no clock: the remaining time is a `Duration64` the embedder supplies from the
authority's own answer, so there is exactly one attempt policy on the machine
and it lives behind the verifier.

## Chrome

`set_chrome` supplies the clock, date, and host name at the top of the column:
the time large and light, the date beneath it, the machine name beneath that,
each centred in its own fixed band. They are bounded display text, never read
back for authority, and any of them may be empty — a machine that cannot tell
the greeter its host name shows no host name rather than a guess.

The chrome's presence is a function of the screen and the density *alone*,
never of which body is up, so a screen cannot appear to gain or lose its clock
when an account is picked. A screen too short to hold the chrome and still show
the prompt keeps the prompt: asking for a secret is what the screen is for.

## The column

One centred vertical stack, the same skeleton in both modes so the screen never
appears to jump:

| Band | Logical size | What sits there |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| chrome | 106 tall, full width, 40 from the top | clock (64), date (24), host (18) |
| disc | 88 × 88 | the chosen account's monogram, in the accent |
| name | 26 tall, full width | the display name, 14 under the disc |
| block | 420 × 96 | the field and the lines under it, 18 under the name |
| field | 320 × the theme's control height | the pill, at the block's top |
| notice | 20 tall | the hint, refusal, or lockout, 10 under the field |
| step-back | 18 tall | `Escape` returns to the chooser, when there is one |

The body is centred in the space beneath the chrome, so both the tile grid and
the prompt hang off the same block. The block is wider than the pill because
the notice under it is prose; a block only as wide as the field would cut it
short.

Every length above is authored in *logical* pixels at the reference density and
converted through the one shared `Scale::scale_length`, so there is no second
conversion and the composition is the same at any DPI. `panel_rect` returns the
block and `field_rect` is the one definition of where the pill sits, read by
both the paint and the pointer hit test, so the two can never resolve different
rectangles.

The field is drawn as a **pill**: the shared `lib/controls` field is rendered
into a scratch row, confined to a stadium, and laid over a stadium in the edge
colour, which stands in for the plate's rim, its focus gap, and its focus ring
— a square ring inside a round field would give the shape away. The edge takes
the danger colour on a refusal exactly as the plate's own rim would have. A
trailing submit mark is drawn only while the field is empty; once a character
is in, the field shows the console's `[input active...]` marker, its dots
stepped by the same `motion_due`/`advance` schedule as the rest of the
screen's motion.

## The backdrop

`Backdrop` is what is painted behind the column, chosen by the caller: either
the active theme's flat desktop colour, or an already-decoded, already-fitted
wallpaper. This crate never learns to decode an image — decoding untrusted
bytes is the caller's sandboxed business.

A picture is painted **exactly as authored**. Nothing darkens, washes, or blurs
it, and no blur is reachable from here in any case (that lives in the
compositor). What keeps the text readable over an unknown photograph is a
shadow behind each line rather than a curtain over the picture: the clock, the
date, the host name, the account name, the notice, the step-back hint, and each
account tile's own label are all drawn through `lib/font`'s one soft shadow,
in the theme's own desktop colour — the contrast-opposite of the on-surface ink
in both built-in themes. Every one of those lines is set in the full
on-surface ink: a muted ink is the first to disappear into a photograph. A line
fading with its stage takes its shadow down with it, so nothing is left
standing where a line has gone.

The decision is made once, in `render`, from the `Backdrop` it was handed, and
carried down with the rest of the frame's state: a picture asks for a shadow,
the flat desktop colour does not. Over that flat colour the shadow *is* the
ground, so it would compose to exactly what is already there — two glyph passes
to draw nothing — which is why the screen lock's known ground pays for one.

The entry and exit veil is still laid through the shared dithered wash
(`lib/raster`'s `fill_vertical_gradient`) rather than a rectangle fill: it is a
flat field over a picture, the shape that bands when every pixel rounds alike.

## Damage

Every `Outcome` reports the rectangle the next paint will change: the field for
a keystroke, the block for a verdict, the two tiles a selection fade is leaving
and arriving at, the band a shake swings through, the chrome band for a clock
tick, and the whole screen for a mode change, a running stage transition, a
veil, or a first frame.
An embedder presenting to a compositor or a display service therefore uploads a
small rectangle for a keystroke instead of a screen. The reported rectangle is
always a superset of what actually changes; the crate's tests assert that
pixel by pixel.

## Security properties

- **Only a verified secret concludes the surface.** There is no cancel, no
  timeout, and no error state that falls through to anything. `Escape` steps
  back to the chooser; it does not conclude. Enforcing that
  *nothing else on the machine* sees the events while it is up is the
  embedder's half of the contract; a surface cannot do that from the inside.
- **The secret lives in exactly one place** — the masked field's buffer,
  reserved once at the account password bound (`tairix_abi::account::MAX_PASSWORD_LEN`,
  in bytes) so typing can never reallocate and strand a copy in a freed block.
  It shows a marker that depends on neither the characters nor their count,
  and redacts itself in `Debug`. An entry longer than that bound is refused
  whole without reaching the authority, never offered as its prefix.
- **It is erased on every path out.** The buffer is wiped as soon as a verdict
  comes back — verified, refused, or unanswerable alike — on a submit a
  cooldown refuses, on every step between accounts, and again when the surface
  is dropped, so an abandoned prompt leaves no plaintext either.
- **A tile discloses only what it draws.** An `AccountTile` carries a display
  name, a login name, and whether that account has a live session. Nothing
  derived from a stored password, and no uid, home path, or capability set,
  reaches this crate at all.
- **Nothing here rate-limits or counts attempts**, deliberately. The authority
  behind the verifier owns that policy and audits every attempt against the
  account; a second policy on this side would be a second place to get it
  wrong, and one that could not slow down an attacker holding the keyboard
  anyway.

## Stability
