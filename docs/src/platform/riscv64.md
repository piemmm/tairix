# riscv64

TAIRiX targets `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf` as a Tier-1 platform. The
production `tairix-kernel` binary boots the QEMU `virt` / SiFive board
to `AuditEvent::BootCompleted`; the host-side **QEMU runner** launches
it (and the Stage 4.D virtio-MMIO integration tests that build on the
same harness). This page documents both — the boot pipeline, the
on-board boot model, the result protocol, and the argv contract.

## Kernel boot pipeline

Like x86_64, `kernel/arch/riscv64` is a pure Arch HAL implementation
(`AGENTS.md` §17.2): it implements `tairix_arch_api::SchedulerArch`, the
monotonic clock, the hart-park primitive, the PLIC register driver, and
the S-mode trap glue, but it names no concrete kernel subsystem. The
boot pipeline that *does* name `kernel/{core,mem,sec}` and
`kernel/sched/api` lives in the production `tairix-kernel` crate
(`tairix_kernel::boot_riscv64`), exactly as x86_64 / aarch64 keep their
boot pipeline and `BinArch` wrapper there. `kernel_main(hartid, dtb)` in
the `tairix-kernel` binary forwards to it. It boots to
`AuditEvent::BootCompleted` and is exercised by the
`tests/integration/kernel_arch_boot_riscv64` QEMU test — the riscv64
analogue of the x86_64 / aarch64 `kernel_arch_boot` bins. That test
crate (`tairix-test-riscv64-boot`) is a thin test-side wrapper over the
same pipeline: it publishes the firmware map + DTB for the device
verticals (see *Boot-state publication*) and delegates to
`tairix_kernel::boot_riscv64::boot`, so there is exactly one riscv64
boot orchestration (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

Boot sequence:

1. **Entry (`boot.s` → `entry.rs`).** OpenSBI enters the ELF in S-mode
   with paging off (`satp = 0`, bare addressing), `a0 = hartid`, and
   `a1 =` the flattened device tree pointer. The `_start` trampoline
   sets up the boot stack, zeroes `.bss`, and tail-calls
   `tairix_arch_riscv64_main(hartid, dtb)`, which forwards to the
   binary-supplied `kernel_main`.
2. **Device-tree parse (`fdt.rs`).** A minimal, bounds-checked FDT
   reader extracts the first `/memory` node's `reg` (base/size) and the
   `/cpus` `timebase-frequency`. It is host-tested against a hand-built
   DTB fixture.
3. **Sv39 MMU + trap vector + dispatch (RV-P2,
   `boot_riscv64::enable_mmu_and_vectors`).** Identity-maps Sv39's whole
   canonical lower half (`[0, 256 GiB)`, 1 GiB leaves — the widest extent
   where a root slot's virtual address *is* the physical address it maps)
   over a `.bss`-resident
   `PageTablePool`, writes `satp`, and points `stvec` at the S-mode trap
   vector (`trap::install_trap_vector`, no asynchronous interrupts
   enabled yet) so the `kernel_core` allocator/scheduler atomics run on
   Normal cacheable memory and a fault during bring-up is taken to a
   handler. The production `ecall` dispatch callback
   (`riscv64::dispatch::production_dispatch`) is installed before any user
   thread can run. A pool that cannot satisfy the identity map fails
   closed (the boot parks rather than running `kernel_main` unpaged).
4. **Boot pipeline (`tairix_kernel::boot_riscv64::boot`).** Builds a
   `BootMemoryMap` reserving `[ram_base, __kernel_end)` (firmware +
   kernel image + boot heap) and marking `[__kernel_end, ram_end)`
   usable, installs the direct physical map over the discovered RAM
   before anything reaches a frame by pointer (see **The direct physical
   map** below), constructs `RiscvArch` (`kernel_arch.rs`, the arch port's
   `tairix_arch_api::SchedulerArch` impl whose monotonic clock reads the
   `time` CSR via `rdtime`) wrapped in the downstream `RiscvBinArch`
   `kernel_core::KernelArch` adapter (orphan rules), assembles a
   `kernel_core::BootInfo`, and hands it to `kernel_core::kernel_main`.
5. **Console (`sbi.rs`, `serial.rs`).** The boot log and audit records
   are written through the SBI legacy `console_putchar`, which OpenSBI
   routes to the same UART `-serial stdio` captures.

RV-P2 runs the production path **paged**. The board enters S-mode with
paging off; step 3 turns the Sv39 identity MMU on before any
allocator/scheduler work. Because the map is identity (physical ==
virtual) and covers the whole canonical lower half, every physical
address the board uses — the kernel image, the firmware DTB, the PLIC,
the `virt` MMIO window, and the per-device DMA regions the
device-bring-up verticals carve — keeps its address under translation.
RAM above that half is reached through the direct physical map instead,
which lives in the upper half and is what every kernel path that touches
a *frame* resolves through. The boot heap is
a 64 MiB `.heap` (NOLOAD) section the linker places *after*
`__kernel_end`, so the trampoline does not zero it and the usable
physical-memory map excludes it.

> The 64 MiB kernel heap allocator itself lives in the shared
> `lib/kalloc` crate (`tairix-kalloc`), registered as the test
> binary's `#[global_allocator]` — the same allocator the x86_64 boot
> bins use, defined once (`AGENTS.md` §2.2, §6).

The Sv39 paging primitives, the context-switch primitive, the
supervisor-timer preemption surface, and the `ecall` syscall entry
exist as host-tested arch primitives (Stage 3c — see *Stage 3
architecture primitives* below). RV-P2 wires the Sv39 identity MMU, the
trap vector, and the `ecall` dispatch callback into the production boot
(step 3); RV-P3 (below) drops PID 1 `init` into U-mode after boot
completes. Enabling asynchronous interrupts (the timer/PLIC) in the
production boot and multi-hart SMP bring-up are the remaining follow-ups.
The ring-0 DTB virtio-mmio walk and the full device bring-up land in the
virtio-MMIO QEMU verticals (below), which now run under the paged boot.

The kernel-side `SiFive` Test finisher (`kernel/arch/riscv64::qemu_exit`)
is what the test bin uses to report its result.

## PID 1 into user mode (RV-P3)

After `kernel_core::kernel_main` emits `AuditEvent::BootCompleted`, the
production riscv64 boot drops PID 1 `init` into U-mode and lets it
supervise the `Shell` session — the riscv64 analogue of the aarch64
`init_spawn`/`spawn_producer` seams. `boot_riscv64::try_boot` installs
three things on the `BootInfo` hand-off:

- **Console backing (`with_consoles`).** `RiscvUartConsole` — a zero-sized
  `kernel_core::ConsoleWrite` over the new verbatim arch-port
  `serial::write_console_bytes` (no `\n` translation, unlike the boot-log
  `SbiWriter`) — is the `stream_write` (fd 1) backing PID 1 writes its
  banner through (`AGENTS.md` §16.4 / §20), listed as the only entry of
  the `BootInfo::with_consoles` console list. Its read half is
  `RiscvUartConsoleRead`, draining the SBI legacy `console_getchar`
  service: the call answers one buffered byte or "nothing pending".
  Without it the port could write a prompt but never read the answer,
  which left the interactive root unlock reachable on every port but this
  one.

  Unlike the sibling ports there is no receive interrupt behind it — the
  firmware console raises none — so the backing declares a re-poll interval
  (`ConsoleRead::poll_interval_ns`) and `BlockingConsoleRead` parks a
  waiting reader on a one-shot timer for that long instead of forever. The
  CPU still sleeps between polls and the kernel stays tickless; the timer is
  armed only while a reader is actually blocked on console input. The
  interval is sized so a sender at a standard line rate cannot overrun the
  16-byte FIFO beneath the firmware between drains. A port whose console
  *does* interrupt leaves the default `None`, so a lost wake there stays a
  visible hang rather than becoming a silent latency bug.

  Console 0's read half is wrapped in the shared `GatedConsoleRead`, as on
  the sibling ports: `login` is withheld until the unlock kthread has read
  the root passphrase off the same console and opened the gate, so the two
  cannot split a typed line between them.
- **PID 1 spawn seam (`with_init`).** `riscv64::init_spawn::RiscvInitSpawn`
  builds the embedded `init` (`Run`) program's image in its own Sv39
  address space (the shared 4 GiB `identity_gigapages()` window plus the
  direct physical map, user bias 64 GiB), switches to it,
  and dispatches it into U-mode through the capability-checked, audited
  `kernel_core::spawn_image` + `admit_init` (gated on `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`).
  Its `pre_resume` hook reactivates PID 1's `satp` root before every
  switch-in (isolation, §4); the kernel-stack-top argument is unused on
  riscv64, since `sscratch` is re-armed per-task by `userentry::enter_user`
  and the trap vector. PID 1's kernel stack is drawn from the
  window-backed stack tier (`kernel/core::kstack`), whose guard slot is
  unmapped in every root at once, so an overrun faults synchronously under
  PID 1's `satp`; a build with no remap window falls back to a heap-backed
  software-canary `BoxStack`, never an unguarded raw stack.
- **Runtime `spawn` producer (`with_spawn`).**
  `riscv64::spawn_producer::RiscvProcessSpawn` + the embedded program
  registry mapping `/System/Services/login.app/Run` (the P11 session `init`
  launches) and `/System/Commands/elsh.app/Run` (the shell login spawns) to
  their baked `rxe`s, each entry carrying its program's declared capability set
  and argument vector (§5.2/§16.5 — login additionally holds
  `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` + `CAP_USERS_READ`). When `init` issues the
  `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`-gated `spawn` syscall, the
  producer builds the session a *fresh, hardware-isolated* Sv39 space
  **without** switching the running caller's `satp`, drawing its page
  tables from the allocator-backed `kernel_mem::FrameTableSource` (no fixed
  reserve, so the spawn capacity scales with RAM and grows on demand,
  §24.1) and admits it Ready — a true concurrent spawn. Each child's
  kernel stack is a window-backed guard stack whose guard slot is unmapped
  in every root at once, mirroring the PID 1 seam, with the same
  fail-closed `BoxStack` fallback.

The embedded `init`/`Shell`/login `rxe` blobs are built for the riscv64
target by the kernel `build.rs` (the same one-build-path the aarch64/x86_64
images use, §2.2). Proven end-to-end by
`tests/integration/spawn_init_qemu_riscv64`: it boots the production
pipeline with only the audit sink swapped and reports `SiFive` PASS once
it observes `ProcessSpawned` (`EventId(4030)`, PID 1) → the
`TAIRiX <version>: …` machine-summary banner (the version is stamped in at
compile time from the crate version; the memory/architecture/core figures
come from the kernel-attested `boot_facts_get` answer) → `ProcessSpawned` (the session) →
`SyscallInvoked` (`EventId(5000)`, `init`'s `spawn`) — proving PID 1
reached U-mode, wrote its banner over the SBI console backing, and
trapped back.

## External-interrupt controller (PLIC) + S-mode trap glue

`kernel/arch/riscv64::plic` and `kernel/arch/riscv64::trap` land the
external-IRQ foundation the virtio-mmio verticals build on. They are
implemented and host-tested. RV-P2's production boot installs the trap
*vector* (`trap::install_trap_vector`) so a synchronous fault / `ecall`
is taken, but does **not** enable asynchronous interrupts or build a
`PlicController` — `sie.SEIE`/`sstatus.SIE` stay clear until a consumer
needs them. The live consumer is the virtio-MMIO QEMU verticals (below),
which `arm` the device source, install the trap dispatch, and call
`init_traps` (which re-installs the vector and enables interrupts).

- **PLIC.** `plic::PlicController` wraps a `Plic<M>` register driver
  over the `PlicMmio` access seam (`VolatilePlicMmio` on the
  freestanding target). It targets the boot hart's S-mode context
  (`s_mode_context(hartid) = 2 * hartid + 1` on the `virt` layout),
  `arm`s a source (enable bit + zero threshold + delivering priority),
  and `claim`/`complete`s through the per-context claim register.
- **Mask-before-wake.** `PlicController::mask` (inherent) masks a source
  by writing its PLIC priority register to zero (a single lock-free
  32-bit store) followed by a `SeqCst` fence — the riscv64 analogue of
  the x86_64 IO-APIC redirection-entry mask. The arch port owns no
  `kernel/irq` dependency, so the kernel-neutral `IrqController` bridge
  (`PlicIrqController`, in `tests/integration/riscv64_boot`) is what
  `IrqTable::fire` calls; it forwards to that inherent `mask`. See
  `docs/src/security/irq.md`.
- **S-mode trap vector.** `trap::init_traps` installs
  `tairix_riscv64_trap_vector` (`trap.s`) into `stvec` (direct mode),
  zeroes `sscratch` (the S-mode invariant, below), and enables
  `sie.SEIE` + `sstatus.SIE`. The vector swaps to a kernel stack via
  `sscratch`, saves the caller-saved registers **plus** the return-state
  CSRs (`sepc`, `sstatus`, and the interrupted `sp`) into a
  `trap::TrapFrame`, and passes its pointer to the Rust handler, which
  dispatches by `scause`: a U-mode `ecall` goes to the syscall path, a
  supervisor external interrupt forwards to the one-shot PLIC dispatch
  callback (claim → `IrqTable::fire` → complete), a supervisor timer
  interrupt drives the scheduler tick, and any other synchronous
  exception reaches `trap::fatal_exception`, which charges it to whoever
  caused it. One taken from U-mode goes to the installed
  `tairix_arch_api::fault::UserFaultTerminateFn`, which kills that task and
  leaves the hart running — a wild jump or an illegal instruction costs its
  process, never the machine. An S-mode one, or a U-mode one that could not
  be attributed to a running task, is the kernel's own: it is forwarded as
  a `KernelFault` to the installed `tairix_arch_api::fault::FaultHandlerFn`
  if one is present — `scause`, `stval` only for the causes that write an
  address there, `sepc`, and the interrupted kernel `sp` — otherwise the
  port writes its own report and parks the hart. `stval` is not
  frame-resident, so the synchronous path reads it once, straight after the
  `ecall` branch and before anything that can take a nested trap — the A/D
  walk, the resolver, the terminator — and hands every consumer that one
  reading.

### Per-task kernel stack + frame-resident return state (`trap.s`)

A trap taken from U-mode must not run the handler on the interrupted
*user* `sp`: a cooperative `ContextSwitch::switch` taken **mid-handler**
(a parking `yield`/`wait`) would otherwise persist the user stack pointer
as the task's saved kernel context, and a different task's later `sret`
would clobber the live `sepc`/`sstatus`/`sp` the parked task needs. This
is the riscv64 sibling of the aarch64 `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/`SP_EL0`
return-state errata; it is the trap-entry redesign the concurrent
user-mode bring-up (`plans/PI.md` §X) requires.

The vector therefore:

- **Swaps `sp` with `sscratch` on entry.** The port-wide invariant is
  that `sscratch` holds the running user task's **trap anchor** while
  running U-mode code, and **0** while running S-mode code. The anchor is
  a `TRAP_ANCHOR_BYTES`-wide kernel-only region at the top of that task's
  kernel-stack window whose first word carries the kernel `tp` of the hart
  the task is running on; the trap frame is built immediately below it.
  A trap from U-mode lands a non-zero anchor address in `sp`; a nested trap
  from S-mode (a timer/IPI taken while running kernel code) lands 0 and
  is recovered onto the interrupted kernel `sp`, so the handler never
  runs on the user stack and a nested kernel trap stays on the kernel
  stack. `userentry::enter_user` arms `sscratch` before its first `sret`;
  `init_traps` zeroes it at boot; the vector re-arms it on every
  U-return and forces it to 0 for the duration of every handler.

  Because that swap is the *only* thing distinguishing a U-mode trap from
  an S-mode one, S-mode interrupts must be masked wherever `sscratch` is
  armed. An interrupt taken in S-mode while it is non-zero is misread as a
  U-mode trap: it builds its frame on the armed stack top, clobbering the
  caller's own frame, and returns down the S-mode path — which does not
  re-arm, so `sscratch` is left 0 and the task runs in U-mode with no
  kernel stack armed, every later trap of it landing on its own *user*
  stack. Both arming sites hold that line: the vector's U-return epilogue
  restores the frame's saved `sstatus` (hardware cleared `SIE` on trap
  entry, so the saved copy always has it clear) before re-arming, and
  `enter_user` clears `sstatus.SIE` in the same `csrc` that aims the `sret`
  at U-mode, ahead of the arm. Interrupts are deliberately *enabled* inside
  the syscall body, so a long `ecall` cannot monopolise the hart; that is
  safe precisely because `sscratch` is 0 for the whole handler, so a nested
  S-mode trap is classified correctly. `sret_tests.rs` pins both orderings
  against their sources, since neither runs on the host and the window is a
  race no target test can reliably enter.
- **Restores the kernel `tp` from the anchor before anything reads it.**
  `tp` (x4) is simultaneously the RISC-V psABI thread pointer U-mode code
  writes freely and this port's per-hart kernel identity anchor —
  `smp::current_hartid` and the Arch-HAL per-CPU slice read the running
  hart's identity out of it. A vector that left `tp` alone would therefore
  hand the kernel a caller-chosen CPU identity on every `ecall`, letting a
  task name a *different* hart and steer the kernel onto that core's
  per-CPU state (its resume handle, dispatch slot, live address space) —
  kernel memory corruption, not merely a wrong reading. The from-U prologue
  spills the user's `tp` straight into the frame's `user_tp` slot and
  reloads the kernel's from the anchor before any other register is
  touched; the U-return epilogue publishes the *current* hart's `tp` into
  the anchor (so a task resumed on a different hart re-enters U-mode under
  that hart's true identity) and then restores the user's value.

  Framing `tp` is also what makes it usable as a **per-thread** pointer at
  all: `thread_create` seeds each new thread's `tp` at user entry, and because
  the frame lives on that thread's own kernel stack the value follows the
  thread rather than the hart — see the [threads
  page](../architecture/threads.md).

  Because the frame lives on the trapping task's own kernel stack, that
  makes the thread pointer genuinely **per task**: U-mode keeps a value of
  its own across every trap and every context switch, which is the
  platform contract thread-local storage rests on. `enter_user` hands a
  freshly entered task a zeroed `tp` rather than leaking the kernel's hart
  id into U-mode. `trap_layout_tests.rs` pins the ordering and every
  frame/anchor offset against `trap.s` itself, and
  `tests/integration/tp_isolation_qemu_riscv64` is the adversarial
  witness: a U-mode fixture writes a hostile `tp` before every `ecall` on
  a two-CPU guest, and the run fails unless the kernel still reads its own
  hart id and the fixture gets its own value back.
- **Saves `sepc`/`sstatus`/`sp` into the per-trap frame** (256 bytes since
  the callee-saved set joined it, the GP-register offsets unchanged so the
  `[u64; …]` syscall view is
  intact) and reloads them before `sret`, choosing the U-mode vs S-mode
  return path from the saved `sstatus.SPP`. Each exception's resume is
  thus self-contained across a cooperative context switch. The syscall
  path advances the **saved** `frame.sepc` past the 4-byte `ecall` (not
  the live CSR, which the epilogue overwrites). The `offset_of!` asserts
  in `syscall_entry_tests.rs` pin every field offset against `trap.s`.

The whole riscv64 QEMU matrix exercises every line of the redesigned
vector — U-mode `ecall`s and faults (`mem_map`/`spawn_program`/
`abi_sys`/`memory_isolation`) drive the from-U swap and the U-return
path, and S-mode timer/IPI traps (`sched_drive`/`ipi_smp`/
`timer_preempt`) drive the nested-S recovery and the S-return path. The
mid-handler-park safety the frame-resident return state guarantees is
consumed by the resumable-user-kthread bring-up that follows.

### Resumable U-mode user kthread (RV-X1)

`paging::activate_user_root(root_phys)` is the per-task `pre_resume`
reactivation primitive — the riscv64 sibling of the aarch64/x86_64
`activate_user_root`. Immediately before the kernel `sret`s back into a
user task's U-mode, that task's own page-table root must be installed so
its translations, and only its, are in force (`AGENTS.md` §4). It writes
`satp` (`satp_sv39(root_phys)` + `sfence.vma`) on a hart whose paging is
already on. Unlike `AddressSpace::switch` it is a free function over the
raw `u64` root rather than the owned (`!Send`) `AddressSpace`, so the
per-task hook captures a plain word and stays `Send`; the `satp` write is
otherwise identical, because Sv39 has a single translation regime.

`tests/integration/spawn_el0_resume_qemu_riscv64` proves the resumable
path on `-M virt`, the sibling of the x86_64 X1 vertical and the aarch64
SP2c timeshare (one task). It reads the generic-timer rate from the
firmware device tree, stands up an Sv39 address space, installs the trap
vector + a syscall-dispatch callback, builds one isolated U-mode space
from the pure-Rust `el0_yielder` fixture through the audited
`kernel_core::spawn_image`, and admits it as a resumable user kthread via
`kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread`. The task's `pre_resume` hook calls
`activate_user_root`; the cooperative `Scheduler::step` loop drives it,
and the dispatch callback maps each `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to
`reschedule_current`, so it ping-pongs with the dispatcher across the
park-safe trap path above — the first exerciser of that safety on a user
task. PASS once the task yielded its full count and exited.

The kernel-stack top `spawn_user_kthread` hands the `pre_resume` hook
(`FnMut(u64)`, the X1 cross-port argument) is unused on riscv64, and
stays unused for *concurrent* tasks too (see RV-X2 below): `sscratch` is
per-task hardware state, not a per-CPU field, so no dispatcher-side
repointing is required.

### Two-task U-mode timeshare (RV-X2)

`tests/integration/spawn_el0_timeshare_qemu_riscv64` proves **two**
isolated U-mode tasks timeshare one hart as resumable user kthreads on
`-M virt` — the riscv64 sibling of the x86_64 X2 and aarch64 SP2c
timeshares. It reads the generic-timer rate from the firmware device
tree, builds two hardware-isolated Sv39 address spaces (two
`PageTablePool`s + a shared frame pool, `AGENTS.md` §4) from the one
`el0_yielder` `rxe` through the audited `kernel_core::spawn_image`,
admits each as a resumable user kthread via
`kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread`, installs the trap vector + dispatch
callback, and drains the cooperative `Scheduler::step` loop while the
callback maps each task's `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to `reschedule_current`.
PASS once both tasks yielded their full count and exited.

Unlike x86_64 — where the syscall entry stub switches to a *per-CPU*
kernel stack that the dispatcher must repoint per task with
`set_kernel_rsp0` — riscv64 needs **no** dispatcher-side stack
repointing, so RV-X2 added only the vertical, no new structural code (as
aarch64 SP2c added nothing over SP2b). `sscratch` is per-task hardware
state: `userentry::enter_user` arms it with a task's own trap anchor on
first entry, and the trap vector's U-return path re-arms it from that
task's own kernel-stack frame on every return to U-mode (`trap.s`:
`sscratch = sp + TRAP_FRAME_SIZE`, where `sp` is the resuming task's
frame base). A trap from whichever task resumes therefore always lands
on *its* kernel stack, so each `pre_resume` hook only reactivates its
`satp` root and ignores the kernel-stack-top argument.

### Runtime `spawn` concurrent producer (RV-X3)

`tests/integration/spawn_session_qemu_riscv64` proves a parent U-mode
task's `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`-gated `spawn` builds a fresh, hardware-isolated
Sv39 child and admits it **Ready** concurrently on `-M virt` — the
riscv64 sibling of `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` / `_x86_64`. The
pure-Rust `spawn_session_program` fixture is built in two roles from one
source (`AGENTS.md` §2.2): the **parent** issues a `spawn` for the
session, then yields; the **child** (session) yields and exits.

On boot the test reads the timer rate, builds the parent a hardware-
isolated Sv39 space through the audited `kernel_core::spawn_image`,
admits it as a resumable user kthread, and drains the cooperative
`Scheduler::step` loop. When the parent's `spawn` `ecall` reaches the
dispatch callback it is routed to a riscv64 `ProcessSpawn` producer (the
cross-port equal of `Aarch64ProcessSpawn` / the x86_64 producer): the
producer builds the child its own Sv39 space over a separate
`PageTablePool` (drawing data frames from the same monotonic pool, so the
two spaces never alias, §4), then admits it Ready via
`spawn_user_kthread` — returning the child's PID to the parent, which
keeps running (a true concurrent spawn, not an `exec` hand-off, §4). The
callback maps `yield`/`exit` to `reschedule_current` as in RV-X2, so the
parent and child timeshare the hart on their own kernel stacks. PASS once
the producer built the child and both tasks yielded their full count and
exited.

The crux mirrors the other ports: the producer builds the child's tables
**without switching the running parent's `satp`**. It captures the
child's Sv39 root but never activates the child space; instead it writes
every child mapping through the parent's identity window (the child's
`PageTablePool` and the data frames both live in the low 4 GiB the parent
identity-maps), so the build touches only physical addresses the parent
already maps and never moves the running parent out from under itself.
The child's own root is installed by its `pre_resume` hook
(`activate_user_root`) the first time the scheduler resumes it.

### `wait`: blocking reap of a child (RV-X4)

`tests/integration/wait_qemu_riscv64` proves a parent U-mode task can
`wait` on, reap, and read back the exit code of its own child under the
live scheduler on `-M virt` — the riscv64 sibling of `wait_qemu_aarch64`
/ `_x86_64`. The pure-Rust `wait_program` fixture is built in two roles
from one source (`AGENTS.md` §2.2): the **child** exits with a
build-pinned code; the **parent** calls `wait`, reaps the child, and
verifies the reaped code before exiting 0.

On boot the test reads the timer rate from the live OpenSBI device tree,
builds a child and a parent hardware-isolated Sv39 space through the
audited `kernel_core::spawn_image`, and admits each as a resumable user
kthread. It records the parent/child link with a
`kernel_core::KernelProcessWait` producer (the shared `ProcessWait` seam)
and drains the cooperative `Scheduler::step` loop. The dispatch callback
routes the child's `exit` and the parent's `wait`/`exit` `ecall`s through
the producer + `reschedule_current`, exactly as the production handler
does: the producer parks the parent (via `reschedule_current(cpu,
Yield)`) until the child is reapable — never busy-spinning (§2.1) — then
the kernel copies the reaped exit code out to the parent's `status`
pointer through the retained frozen parent space (`copy_out`, fail-closed
on a faulting pointer, §5.4). PASS once the parent reaped the child, read
back the agreed code, and exited 0.

This exercises the resume-after-cooperative-park return-state path on a
*user* task: the parent is parked mid-handler by `wait` and re-dispatched
once the child has exited, so RV1's per-task kernel-stack + frame-resident
return state (the `sscratch` swap and the frame `sepc`/`sstatus`/`sp`
save) must round-trip the parent's trap state across the park. No new
structural code was needed beyond the vertical — the `KernelProcessWait`
producer, `reschedule_current`, and the RV1 trap path are all already in
place.

## Stage 3 architecture primitives

These are the host-tested arch primitives the Stage-3 per-sub-stage
checklist requires (`PLAN.md` Stage 3). Each mirrors its x86_64
counterpart and keeps the pure bit/encoding math host-testable, gating
only the CSR/assembly operations to the freestanding riscv64 target.

- **Sv39 paging (`paging.rs`).** The three-level, 39-bit page-table
  primitives: PTE PPN encode/decode (`pte_from_phys` / `phys_from_pte`),
  per-level VPN extraction (`vpn_index`), the `satp` Sv39 selector
  (`satp_sv39`), a `.bss` `PageTablePool`, and an `AddressSpace` that
  identity-maps the low gigabytes with 1 GiB leaves, adds 4 KiB mappings
  through `map_4k`, and activates via `satp` + `sfence.vma` in `switch`.
  The `AddressSpace` draws its tables through the Arch HAL
  `PageTableFrames` seam (Stage W5b-3): the `.bss` `PageTablePool` is the
  boot/bootstrap source, and a real per-process space is backed by
  `kernel/mem`'s `FrameTableSource` over the frame allocator. The walk
  recovers each level through `PageTableFrames::table_at` on the source
  that drew it, so the `frames::conformance` suite runs on the host
  (`passes_frames_conformance`) and a PTE naming an address the source
  never handed out fails the walk closed.
  This is the architectural mechanism the memory-isolation vertical
  exercises: two hierarchies disagreeing on one VA so the MMU faults a
  cross-address-space access (`AGENTS.md` §4; see *Memory-isolation QEMU
  vertical* below).
- **Synchronous-exception decode (`fault.rs`).** The page-fault `scause`
  constants, `is_page_fault` and its kin, and `stval_is_address`, which
  names the causes whose `stval` holds a faulting address. The fault
  handler itself is the one set-once slot every port shares
  (`tairix_arch_api::fault::set_fault_handler`): the `trap` handler hands it
  an unexpected synchronous exception as a `KernelFault` before falling back
  to the port's own report, so a kernel slice or test can decide what an
  otherwise-fatal fault means. A second publish fails closed.
- **Context switch (`context.rs` + `context.s`).** `TaskCtx { sp }` plus
  `tairix_arch_riscv64_switch`, which saves `ra` + `s0`–`s11` + `a0`
  onto the outgoing kernel stack, swaps `sp` through `TaskCtx`, and
  restores symmetrically. `TaskCtx::prepare` seeds a first-run frame
  (`ra = entry`, `a0 = arg`) into the `KernelStackRegion` it is handed, so
  the write carries provenance for the bytes it lands in; a `const _`
  assert pins the 112-byte frame to a 16-byte multiple and `TaskCtx` to a
  single `sp` field at offset 0.
- **Supervisor-timer preemption (`preempt.rs`).** A set-once tick
  callback (`set_timer_callback`), the `sie.STIE` enable and the
  supervisor-timer `scause` decode, `interval_for_hz` (timebase →
  ticks), `init_local_preempt` (arm the SBI timer + enable `STIE`), and
  `on_timer_interrupt` (invoke the callback, then re-arm via SBI
  `set_timer`, which acknowledges `sip.STIP`). The kernel-side run-queue
  mutation stays in `kernel/sched::Scheduler::on_timer_tick`; this module
  only wires the riscv64 timer to it. The
  `tests/integration/timer_preempt_qemu_riscv64` QEMU vertical proves the
  path end-to-end: it arms the timer at 100 Hz and confirms the callback
  is driven repeatedly before reporting PASS.
- **`ecall` syscall entry (`syscall_entry.rs`).** riscv64 has no
  dedicated syscall instruction pair; a U-mode `ecall` raises a
  synchronous exception the trap handler routes here. `pack_raw_args`
  marshals `a0`–`a5` into the frozen `tairix_abi` `[u64; SYSCALL_MAX_ARGS]`
  layout (the same one x86_64 builds — `AGENTS.md` §2.2), `dispatch_ecall`
  forwards `(a7, &args)` to the set-once dispatch callback and writes the
  result into the frame's `a0`, and the handler advances the saved
  `frame.sepc` past the 4-byte `ecall` (the trap epilogue reloads `sepc`
  from the frame). Absent a callback it fails closed. The
  architecture-neutral validation/capability/audit dispatcher lives in
  `kernel/syscall` and is installed by the downstream binary.

## Memory-isolation QEMU vertical

`tests/integration/memory_isolation_qemu_riscv64` is the riscv64
analogue of the x86_64 `tests/integration/memory_isolation` vertical and
the Stage-3 "memory-isolation test passes" deliverable (`AGENTS.md` §4).
It links only the arch port and supplies its own `kernel_main`:

1. Builds a **victim** and an **attacker** `paging::AddressSpace`, each
   identity-mapping the low 4 GiB (the board MMIO plus the RAM base at
   `0x8000_0000`). The victim additionally maps a 4 KiB secret frame at a
   virtual address (64 GiB) far above that window; the attacker does not.
2. Switches `satp` to the victim and reads the secret VA, confirming the
   mapping is genuine.
3. Installs an `on_fault` handler through
   `tairix_arch_api::fault::set_fault_handler`,
   calls `trap::init_traps`, switches `satp` to the attacker, and reads
   the same VA.
4. The MMU raises a **load page fault** (`scause` 13); the trap vector
   routes it to `on_fault`, which asserts the cause is a load page fault,
   `stval` equals the secret VA, and the victim's frame is still intact
   at its physical address — then writes the `SiFive` Test PASS finisher.

A regression that fails to isolate the address never faults and trips a
per-site failure finisher instead (`AGENTS.md` §5.4.5 — fail closed).
The test is enrolled in `tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs` (single
CPU, 60 s budget).

## Cross-CPU TLB-shootdown HAL slice

riscv64 implements the Arch HAL `CrossCpuTlbShootdown` slice
(`tairix_arch_api::xtlb`, `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W13) on `RiscvArch`.
There is no broadcast `sfence.vma`, so `shootdown_page` invalidates the
calling hart locally — the shared `paging::invalidate_page_local`
sequence the local `TlbShootdown::flush_page` also uses (`AGENTS.md`
§2.2) — and reaches every *other* online hart through the SBI **RFENCE**
extension: a `remote_sfence_vma` firmware call (`sbi::remote_sfence_vma`,
issued over the new `sbi_call4` with `SBI_EXT_RFENCE`). The firmware
returns only once the listed harts have fenced, so it performs the remote
acknowledge — no software ack loop is needed.

`tests/integration/cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown_qemu_riscv64` is the real
two-hart proof: the boot hart starts a second hart (SBI HSM
`hart_start`), drives `RiscvArch::shootdown_page`, then asserts a direct
`remote_sfence_vma` to the live hart returns success — proving the
firmware honoured the remote fence. Enrolled in
`tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs` (`cpus: 2`, 60 s budget); it runs
under `cargo xtask test --qemu`.

## Secondary-CPU bring-up HAL slice

riscv64 implements the Arch HAL `SecondaryBringup` slice
(`tairix_arch_api::smp`, `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W14) on `RiscvArch`.
`start_secondary(cpu)` resolves the dense `CpuId` to its hart id through
the handle's map (failing closed with `SmpError::InvalidCpu` for the boot
hart or an unmapped id) and delegates to `kernel/arch/riscv64::smp::start_secondary`,
the SBI HSM `hart_start` firmware call that starts the parked hart at the
`smp.s` trampoline. The host `passes_secondary_bringup_conformance` test
runs `smp::conformance::run_all` over a real handle (object-safe, fails
closed, never panics); the real `hart_start` is proven by the two-hart
QEMU verticals. Those verticals start their secondary hart through this
HAL trait — `cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown_qemu_riscv64` and, since
`plans/WIRING.md` Stage W15, `ipi_smp_qemu_riscv64` — rather than
calling the port-private `smp::start_secondary` directly.

The freshly-started hart has no stack until the `smp.s` trampoline gives
it one, and that stack pool is **not** a fixed `.bss` reserve keyed to a
hand-picked hart count (`AGENTS.md` §24.1). The boot hart registers a
caller-sized `smp::SecondaryStackPool<N>` (`N` = the hart count it sizes
for its machine; a `static` for the allocator-free bins per the §24.1
watch-out), and `register` publishes the pool base and the per-hart
slice's log2 byte size into the globals the trampoline reads. The
trampoline computes each started hart's stack top as
`base + (hartid + 1) << shift` — a left shift, since the freestanding
stub avoids the `M` multiply extension — and `register` orders the
publish ahead of any SBI `hart_start` with a `fence`. Registration is
set-once and an unstarted system fails closed: `is_valid_hartid` reports
every id invalid until a pool is registered, so a `hart_start` for an
unbacked hart is refused (`AGENTS.md` §2.9 / §5.4.5). The per-hart
preemption timer slots are likewise a caller-sized
`preempt::PreemptStorage<N>` published as `&'static [AtomicU64]` slices.
The per-stack size (`SECONDARY_STACK_BYTES`, 16 KiB) stays a fixed
*bound*, not a hart-count capacity (`AGENTS.md` §24.4). The two-hart
`ipi_smp_qemu_riscv64` and `cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown_qemu_riscv64`
verticals register a `SecondaryStackPool<2>`; the single-hart
`timer_preempt_qemu_riscv64` registers a `PreemptStorage<1>`.

## CC2 `abi-sys` `ecall` round-trip QEMU vertical

`tests/integration/abi_sys_syscall_qemu_riscv64` is the riscv64 half of
the `plans/CCOMPAT.md` stage CC2 per-native-target round-trip for the
C-callable syscall stub runtime (`lib/abi-sys`). Where x86_64 can drive
the stub straight from ring 0 (its `syscall` traps identically from any
privilege level), a riscv64 `ecall` only reaches the kernel's U-mode
syscall path when raised from U-mode (`is_ecall_from_user` matches only
`SCAUSE_ECALL_FROM_U`). The test therefore stands up a minimal U-mode
context with the Stage-3 Sv39 primitives:

1. Identity-maps the low 4 GiB (kernel code/stack, trap vector, MMIO) as
   S-mode-only.
2. Aliases the `tairix_sys_cap_query` stub page at a high user VA with the
   `U` bit set (`flags::USER | READ | EXEC`) and maps a small user stack
   (`USER | READ | WRITE`). The stub is a self-contained leaf, so a
   single-page code alias is sufficient; the identity pages carry no `U`
   bit, so U-mode can reach only the aliased stub and its stack.
3. Installs the syscall dispatch callback (`syscall_entry::set_dispatch_callback`),
   points `stvec` at the trap vector (`trap::init_traps`), sets
   `sstatus.SUM` (so the S-mode trap handler may touch the U-bit stack),
   and `sret`s to U-mode at the aliased stub entry with the capability id
   in `a0`.

The stub's `ecall` raises an environment-call-from-U exception into the
S-mode trap vector, which marshals `a7`/`a0`–`a5` and calls the
callback; the callback asserts the dispatched `(number, args)` are
exactly what `tairix_sys_cap_query` should have placed in the registers
before writing the `SiFive` Test PASS finisher. Any mismatch (or the
`ecall` resuming in U-mode at all) trips a distinct failure finisher
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4.5). Enrolled in `tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs`
(single CPU, 60 s budget); it runs under `cargo xtask test --qemu`, not
the host-only `cargo xtask ci` gate.

## Boot-state publication

`riscv64_boot::publish` exposes the boot-state a driver-bring-up
observer needs as set-once slots, the riscv64 analogue of the
`tairix-kernel` bin crate's `arch_wrapper` slots on x86_64. They are a
test-only affordance, so they live in the test-side `riscv64_boot`
wrapper crate (not in the production `boot_riscv64` pipeline, which
never carries a test-observer side channel, and not in the HAL-only arch
port, which must not name `kernel/mem` — `AGENTS.md` §17.2 / §5.4.5):

- `publish_memory_map` / `published_memory_map` — a `'static` clone of
  the firmware `BootMemoryMap`, published by the `riscv64_boot::boot`
  wrapper (via the production `boot_riscv64::build_boot_memory_map`)
  before it delegates to `boot_riscv64::boot`, which moves its own copy
  into the `kernel_core` hand-off — so a vertical can carve a per-device
  DMA pool from high RAM without re-borrowing the kernel state.
- `publish_dtb` / `published_dtb` — the flattened-device-tree pointer
  (`a1`), so a vertical can walk the `virtio_mmio` slots, the PLIC base,
  and each device's `interrupts` cell when it builds the MMIO transport
  and the external-IRQ path.

Both slots are one-shot (`AGENTS.md` §2.1) and the accessors expose no
writable surface (`AGENTS.md` §2.4). The external-interrupt path is
**not** a test-only slot: the production boot pipeline builds the
single-context S-mode `PlicIrqController` from the firmware device tree,
sizes and publishes the kernel-core `IrqTable` (`max_line == riscv,ndev`),
installs the S-mode external-interrupt dispatch, and enables `sie.SEIE`
in its `Irq` phase (leaving `sstatus.SIE` to the task the scheduler
runs). `riscv64_boot` re-exports the kernel accessors
(`published_irq_table` / `plic_controller`) so a vertical binds its
device source into that one published path rather than standing up a
second controller + table — the trap dispatch is set-once per boot and
the controller is one-per-boot (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

## virtio-MMIO QEMU verticals

`tests/integration/virtio_blk_mmio_riscv64` is the MMIO analogue of the
x86_64 `virtio_blk_pci_x86_64` vertical: it boots the production riscv64
pipeline and, on `AuditEvent::BootCompleted`, drives a real virtio-blk
device over the `virt` board's virtio-mmio bus end-to-end. The
device-agnostic lifecycle and the per-device tails are shared with the
x86_64 verticals through the `tests/integration/virtio_qemu_support`
crate (`AGENTS.md` §2.2); only the arch-specific bring-up differs
(`imp_mmio` vs. `imp_pci`). The riscv64 network path is exercised by the
**two-process** production-boot `netstack_autoload_qemu_riscv64` vertical
(`plans/NETWORK.md` N4e-riscv64), not a single-process engine test.

The riscv64 bring-up (`imp_mmio`):

1. Reads `published_dtb` / `published_memory_map` (see *Boot-state
   publication*) and carves a per-device DMA region from the top of RAM.
2. Builds the `virt`-board virtio-MMIO bus via the public
   `tairix_drv_bus_mmio::virtio_mmio_bus_from_dtb` constructor (the MMIO
   analogue of `tairix_pci::mechanism_one`; the concrete bus
   type stays crate-private behind `impl VirtioMmioBus`, §8) and
   provisions an `MmioTransport` through the `CAP_MMIO_MAP`-gated
   `KernelMmioMapper` (`kernel/virtio::provision_virtio_mmio`).
3. Walks the DTB for the device's `interrupts` source, binds it into the
   kernel `IrqTable` the boot pipeline published, and `arm`s the source
   through the published `PlicIrqController`. The production S-mode trap
   dispatch (PLIC claim → `IrqTable::fire` → complete → wake) and
   `sie.SEIE` are already installed by the boot pipeline, so the vertical
   installs no dispatch of its own and calls no `init_traps`.
4. Mints a `KernelVirtioHost` over the carved DMA pool and runs the
   shared `drive_driver_lifecycle` (`load → reload → device round-trip →
   unload`).

The completion park is a race-free `wfi`: the waiter unmasks the PLIC
source, clears `sstatus.SIE`, re-checks the line's ready flag, parks on
`wfi` only if still not ready, then restores `SIE`. Clearing `SIE` holds
a completion that lands in the check/`wfi` window *pending* (not taken)
so `wfi` observes it — no lost wake-up, no bounding timer. The
device-level virtio-MMIO `InterruptACK` is the loaded driver's job (its
transport acknowledges the source as it drains the used ring), so a
level-high virtio-mmio source deasserts before the waiter re-arms it —
the park needs no dispatch-level ACK.

The `kernel/virtio` (`tairix-kernel-virtio`) crate holds the
architecture-neutral `KernelVirtioFactory` and the PCI/MMIO provisioning
walks so both the x86_64 (PCI) and riscv64 (MMIO) verticals reuse the
same code; it depends on no `kernel/arch/*` port (`AGENTS.md` §2.2, §6).

## virtio-input QEMU vertical

`tests/integration/input_virtio_mmio_qemu_riscv64` is the `input`-class
sibling of the blk/net MMIO verticals — the riscv64 analogue of the
aarch64 `input_virtio_mmio_qemu_aarch64` vertical and the MMIO analogue
of the x86_64 PS/2 vertical. It reuses the exact `imp_mmio` bring-up
above, then instead of a storage or network round-trip it loads the
signed virtio-input `.rxe` and decodes a real injected key. The
device-id (`18`, virtio-input) and the spawner registering the loaded image
through `tairix_drv_input_virtio_input::register` are the only per-vertical
specifics; the `virtio_input_keypress` key-decode tail is the same shared
`virtio_qemu_support` code the aarch64 vertical runs (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

"Use" is a **real injected key**, the device-side analogue of the PS/2
vertical's `0xD2` output-buffer injection. A `no_std`, non-interactive
guest cannot type at itself, and virtio-input is strictly
device→driver, so the key originates host-side: the QEMU runner
attaches a `virtio-keyboard-device` (`Spec::with_virtio_keyboard`),
drains the serial console on a background thread, and — once the guest
logs its event-queue-armed readiness marker — sends `sendkey` through a
QEMU monitor on a private unix socket. The injected key raises the
device's PLIC source, the guest's S-mode trap path wakes, and the driver
decodes the press and — after reload — the matching release. The runner
monitor-injection path is architecture-neutral; only the riscv64 argv
builder's `virtio-keyboard-device` attach is new here.

## Board model: `virt`

The runner targets QEMU's generic `virt` board (`qemu-system-riscv64 -M
virt`). Unlike x86_64 there is no firmware ISO step: `-bios default`
loads the OpenSBI firmware bundled with QEMU, which jumps to the ELF
supplied via `-kernel`. The kernel ELF is therefore the bootable
artifact directly — `Runner::run` passes `spec.kernel` straight through
to the riscv64 argv builder.

The `virt` board carries the devices the Stage 4.D drivers exercise: a
SiFive Test device, eight virtio-mmio transports, and a generic PCIe
host bridge. Every virtio-mmio transport is forced to the modern
(virtio 1.x, version 2) interface with `-global
virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` — QEMU defaults to the legacy (version 1)
interface, but TAIRiX' `MmioTransport` only drives the modern layout. A
backing image attached with `Spec::with_virtio_blk`
surfaces as a `virtio-blk-device` on one of the virtio-mmio transports —
the riscv64 analogue of the x86_64 `virtio-blk-pci` function, driven by
`drivers/bus/virtio::MmioTransport`. A network interface attached with
`Spec::with_virtio_net_dgram(qemu_sock, peer_sock, pcap)` surfaces the
same way as a `virtio-net-device` on a virtio-mmio transport, behind
QEMU's `dgram` unix-datagram backend (one raw Ethernet frame per
datagram, the harness-side `netpeer` stack on the other end); the
`pcap` path attaches a `filter-dump` so the host can inspect the
neighbour + echo exchange after the run.

## Result protocol: SiFive Test device

x86_64 reports a test result through the `isa-debug-exit` device as a
*non-zero* QEMU process status (`(0x10 << 1) | 1`). riscv64 has no such
device; the `virt` board exposes a SiFive Test (`sifive_test`) finisher
at MMIO base `0x10_0000` instead. The kernel writes a 32-bit word there:

- `FINISHER_PASS` (`0x5555`) makes QEMU exit with process status `0`.
  The runner treats this — and only this — as success.
- `FINISHER_FAIL` (`0x3333`) in the low half, with an exit code in the
  high half (`(code << 16) | 0x3333`), makes QEMU exit with that `code`.
  Every non-zero status is a failure.

Because success is a *zero* status on riscv64 and a *non-zero* status on
x86_64, the exit-status decode is per-architecture:
`Arch::outcome_from_status` dispatches to `riscv64::outcome_from_status`
(zero ⇒ `Pass`) or `Outcome::from_qemu_status` (x86_64 convention). The
finisher constants live beside the argv builder in
`tools/qemu/src/riscv64.rs` and are pinned by a unit test; the
kernel-side `kernel/arch/riscv64::qemu_exit` mirrors the same values
(`SIFIVE_TEST_BASE`, `FINISHER_PASS`, `FINISHER_FAIL`) with its own
tie-down test, so the two sides cannot drift. The kernel writes the
finisher word through `qemu_exit::exit_success` / `exit_failure(code)`;
the failure word is built by the pure `qemu_exit::fail_word(code)`
(`(code << 16) | FINISHER_FAIL`).

`code` is a `NonZeroU16`. Zero is this board's *pass* status, so a
zero-coded failure would put `FINISHER_FAIL` alone on the bus and exit
QEMU with status 0 — a failing run reported as a passing one. The type is
what forecloses it; `fail_word`'s unit test walks the whole `1..=0xFFFF`
domain and asserts the reported status is never zero. Fixtures mint their
codes with `tairix_itest_finisher::fail_point!`, which rejects a zero
literal at compile time.

## Per-arch runner module

| Surface | Module |
|---|---|
| `Outcome`, `Arch`, `Spec`, `Runner`, per-arch exit decode dispatch | `tools/qemu/src/lib.rs` (architecture-neutral) |
| `DEFAULT_RAM_MIB`, `QEMU_BINARY`, `MACHINE`, `SIFIVE_TEST_BASE`, `FINISHER_PASS/FAIL`, `outcome_from_status`, `virt` argv assembly | `tools/qemu/src/riscv64.rs` |

The argv contract — `-M virt`, `-no-reboot`, `-display none`, `-serial
stdio`, `-m {DEFAULT_RAM_MIB}M`, `-smp {spec.cpus}`, `-bios default`,
`-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false`, `-kernel {elf}`, and one
`-drive if=none,format=raw,id=blkN,file=…` +
`-device virtio-blk-device,drive=blkN` pair per backing image, plus one
`-netdev dgram,id=netN,…` + `-device virtio-net-device,netdev=netN` pair
(and an optional `-object filter-dump`) per network interface, plus a
single `-device virtio-keyboard-device` when an input vertical requests
key injection — is
asserted by host unit tests in `tools/qemu/src/riscv64.rs::tests`. They
use the same pure `build_argv` helper pattern as the x86_64 backend, so
they run without spawning QEMU. The `Spec::for_riscv64_kernel`,
`with_cpus`, `with_timeout`, `with_virtio_blk`, `with_virtio_net_dgram`,
and `Runner::run` entry points are shared with
x86_64; only the per-arch backend differs (`AGENTS.md` §2.4 — no
interface creep).

## Manual debugging

The `tairix-qemu-run` wrapper takes `--arch riscv64` (e.g. the input
vertical reproduces with `tairix-qemu-run --arch riscv64
--virtio-keyboard "<marker>" a`); riscv64 runs also go through
`Runner::run` or `cargo xtask test --qemu` (which builds and launches
the enrolled riscv64 bins for `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`). A run can
also be reproduced by hand:

```text
qemu-system-riscv64 -M virt -no-reboot -display none -serial stdio \
    -m 256M -smp 1 -bios default \
    -kernel target/riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf/debug/tairix-test-kernel-arch-boot-riscv64
```

A clean boot prints the phase timeline and `id=4004 kernel boot
completed`, after which the `SiFive` Test finisher exits QEMU with
status `0`.

## Platform discovery (hardware tree)

The riscv64 port implements the Arch HAL `PlatformDiscovery` slice
(`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / §18.2) in `kernel/arch/riscv64::platform`. The
device-tree parser now lives once in the shared `lib/fdt` crate (§2.2);
`kernel/arch/riscv64::fdt` re-exports it so the boot path and the QEMU
integration tests keep naming `tairix_arch_riscv64::fdt::Fdt`.
`FdtDiscovery` normalises the two facts the reader extracts — the first
`/memory` region and the `/cpus` `timebase-frequency` — into the single
`lib/abi` hardware tree: a root node, a `Memory` node carrying the RAM
window as a capability-gated (`CAP_MMIO_MAP`) resource, and a `Timer`
node. It is host-tested against the shared DTB fixture and exercised by
the port's `passes_arch_hal_conformance_suite`.

The boot pipeline publishes that discovered tree to user space: after it
extracts the timer rate, memory map, and CPU name, `try_boot` runs
`FdtDiscovery` into the shared `tairix_kernel::boot_hwtree::CollectingHwNodeSink`
(the one growable collection sink the aarch64 boot path also uses, §2.2)
and seeds the authoritative `HW_TREE` the `hw_tree_read` / `hw_tree_wait`
syscalls read. This is **pure device-tree normalisation — no MMIO register
access** — so it is safe before any bootstrap-floor bus bring-up: a
malformed tree seeds an empty inventory (fail closed), never a boot
failure. The bootstrap-floor virtio-MMIO `DeviceID` probe (which reads
device MMIO to publish per-device autoloadable `Block`/`Input`/`Network`
nodes) and the driver-autoload-into-user-process path are the staged next
step for the port (`plans/NETWORK.md` N4e-riscv64); until they land the
riscv64 tree carries the platform (root/memory/timer) nodes only.

## Per-CPU storage (`tp`)

The riscv64 port implements the Arch HAL `PerCpu` slice (`AGENTS.md`
§17.2) in `kernel/arch/riscv64::percpu_hal` over the **`tp`**
(thread-pointer) register — the conventional RISC-V per-hart anchor that
`boot.s` and `smp.s` already seed with the SBI-handed hart id before
entering Rust. `PerCpuStorage::read_self_base` / `write_self_base` are a
single `mv`-from / `mv`-to `tp`; the word is opaque (the kernel decides
whether it holds the hart id or a per-hart control-block address). On the
host build there is no `tp`, so the handle backs the word with an
in-handle cell solely for the round-trip + isolation conformance
verticals (`percpu::conformance`), folded into the port's
`passes_arch_hal_conformance_suite`.

### Per-CPU bookkeeping storage (`RiscvArchStorage`)

`RiscvArch` keeps two pieces of per-CPU bookkeeping — the dense-`CpuId` →
hart-id map and a host-only IPI ledger — but it does **not** size them
with a fixed `MAX_HARTS` array (`AGENTS.md` §24.1, the resource-scaling
charter). Instead the handle borrows two `&'static [AtomicU64]` slices
from a caller-provided `RiscvArchStorage<N>`, where `N` is the
logical-CPU count the *caller* sizes for its machine: a single-hart
vertical declares `static S: RiscvArchStorage<1>`, a two-hart vertical
`<2>`, and a multi-hart boot path would size `N` from the device-tree
hart count. The backing is a plain `static` (the allocator-free pattern
every QEMU vertical uses) or a leaked allocation, so the arch crate
itself never names `alloc` and the allocator-free Stage-2 paging-only
bins (which never construct the handle) are untouched.

An unpopulated map slot is the `u64::MAX` (`NO_HARTID`) sentinel — a real
hart id is a `u32`, so it can never collide — and `RiscvArch::new` /
`with_harts` populate the map through the shared `&'static` borrow with
atomic stores, so no `&'static mut` is needed. Every accessor and the
cross-CPU shootdown / IPI loops bound their indices by the slice length,
so the handle carries no CPU ceiling. (The `smp::MAX_HARTS` constant is
gone: the secondary-stack pool is now a caller-sized
`smp::SecondaryStackPool<N>` and the per-hart timer slots a caller-sized
`preempt::PreemptStorage<N>` — see *Secondary-CPU bring-up HAL slice*.)

## Interrupt controller (PLIC)

The riscv64 port implements the Arch HAL `IrqController` and
`InterruptEntry` slices (`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W3)
on `kernel/arch/riscv64::plic::PlicController`, the same controller the
downstream `kernel/irq` bridge already drives. `IrqController::mask` /
`unmask` forward to the inherent priority-zero masking (mapping
`PlicError::SourceOutOfRange` to `IrqControlError::OutOfRange`), and
`InterruptEntry::claim` / `complete` forward to the PLIC claim/complete
register pair — PLIC source `0` ("no interrupt pending") maps to `None`.
Because the controller already abstracts its registers behind the
host-testable `PlicMmio` seam, the `plic_controller_passes_arch_hal_irq_conformance`
host test drives `irq::conformance::run_controller` (source 8 valid, 32
out of range) and `run_entry` over a real `PlicController` on a mock MMIO.

The downstream `kernel/irq` bridge (`PlicIrqController`) that
`IrqTable::fire` and the `irq_wait` park path drive is deliberately *not*
symmetric with the arch-HAL `mask`/`unmask` pair: its `mask` drops the
source priority to zero (mask-before-wake), but its `rearm` calls the
inherent `arm` (per-context **enable bit** + zero threshold + delivering
priority), not the priority-only `unmask`. This is the direct analogue of
the aarch64 GIC bridge's `rearm` (which routes + enables the SPI): the
user-space `irq_wait` park path re-arms an autoloaded driver's line *on its
behalf* (the driver holds no PLIC access), and on the PLIC "make deliverable"
means enabling the source — nothing in-kernel `arm`s a user-space driver's
line first, so a priority-only `unmask` would leave it enabled-never and its
interrupt would never reach the S-mode context. `arm` is idempotent, so a
re-arm of an already-enabled line is a plain pair of register writes.

## Timer programming (`Timer`)

The riscv64 port implements the Arch HAL `Timer` slice (`AGENTS.md`
§17.2 / `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W4) in
`kernel/arch/riscv64::timer_hal` (struct `TimerHal`) over the
supervisor (SBI) timer wired in `kernel/arch/riscv64::preempt`.
`TimerHal::set_tick_callback` / `tick_callback` forward to the `preempt`
callback static, and `dispatch_tick` invokes it. The S-mode trap
handler's `preempt::on_timer_interrupt` dispatches each supervisor-timer
interrupt through `TimerHal::dispatch_tick`, so the callback invoke lives
in one place (§2.2); the SBI `set_timer` re-arm and the `sie.STIE` enable
stay in `preempt` (§2.4). On the host build the handle forwards to the
same static, so the `passes_timer_conformance` host test runs
`timer::conformance::run_all` over a real `TimerHal`. The
`timer_preempt_qemu_riscv64` vertical installs its tick callback through
`TimerHal` and stays green through the HAL.

## Context switch (`ContextSwitch`)

The riscv64 port implements the Arch HAL `ContextSwitch` slice
(`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W5) in
`kernel/arch/riscv64::context_hal` (struct `ContextSwitchHal`) over the
bare-metal task-switch primitive in `kernel/arch/riscv64::context`
(`TaskCtx { sp }` + `context.s`'s `ra`/`s0`–`s11`/`a0` save/restore).
`ContextSwitchHal::prepare` seeds a never-run task's first frame and
`switch` performs the S-mode switch. The neutral `TaskContext` and the
port's `TaskCtx` are both a single `#[repr(C)]` `u64`, so the handle
reinterprets the pointer and forwards to `context` (a const-assert pins
the layout equality); the switch invoke lives in one place (§2.2). The
`prepare` contract is host-tested via `context::conformance::run_all`
(`passes_context_switch_conformance`); the switch itself is proven on the
bare-metal target by `sched_drive_qemu_riscv64`, so it carries no host
check (§2.1 — no fake primitive).

## MMU / page-table (`AddressSpace`)

The riscv64 port implements the Arch HAL `AddressSpace` slice
(`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W5b-1) on its
`kernel/arch/riscv64::paging::AddressSpace` (the three-level Sv39 hierarchy
selected by `satp`). `AddressSpace::map_page` translates the neutral
`PageFlags` into Sv39 R/W/X/U permission bits (`sv39_flags`; `DEVICE` has
no Sv39 page-table attribute — memory type is PMA-driven — so it maps to
the same R/W/X), then walks the table (reusing `map_4k`, one walk, §2.2)
and fails closed (`Misaligned`/`AlreadyMapped`/`PoolExhausted`/
`InvalidFlags`). `root_phys` returns the root table's address and
`activate` forwards to the gated `switch` (the `satp` write +
`sfence.vma`). Because the walk recovers each intermediate table through
the `PageTableFrames` source that drew it — never by dereferencing the
physical address a parent entry holds — the whole `map_page` path is
host-runnable:
`passes_mmu_conformance` drives `mmu::conformance::run_all` over a real
`AddressSpace`, and a companion host test asserts the flag translation and
the resulting leaf bits. The `satp` write itself is proven by
`memory_isolation_qemu_riscv64`, which now builds its victim/attacker
spaces through this trait.

A user leaf is refused outright in any kernel root slot
(`is_kernel_slot` — the direct physical map and the remap window above
it), with `MapError::InvalidFlags` rather than whatever the kernel's own
shared windows happen to have mapped there. The window allocators already
bound every user address below the half, so this is the fail-closed floor
under them rather than the only check.

### The direct physical map

Every kernel path that reaches a frame by *pointer* — the process-image
write, the shared-region zero-on-free scrub, the kernel heap's slab page
supply, the root-unlock DMA pool, a page-table walk's own table recovery —
resolves through the port's direct physical map, published as the one
`spawn_producer::SPAWN_TABLE_PHYSMAP`. Physical `p` is reachable at
`PHYSMAP_VMA_BASE + p`.

**Where it lives, and why not the lower half.** The map claims root slots
`256..=446`: slot 256 is exactly where the port's user virtual region ends
(`USER_VA_TOP == 1 << 38`), and slots 447 upward are the kernel remap
window. Sv39 sign-extends from bit 38, so `PHYSMAP_VMA_BASE` is
`0xFFFF_FFC0_0000_0000`, and — because a root-level Sv39 leaf *is* a 1 GiB
page — 191 slots give **191 GiB** of reach for no page tables at all. Three
properties fall out of that placement, and all three were defects while the
map was a 4 GiB identity window (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D56):

* **Its extent is bounded by the architecture, not by the child image.** A
  lower-half map had to stop short of the user image bias
  (`spawn_layout::CHILD_USER_BIAS`, 64 GiB) or it would have mapped RAM over
  a child's own pages; this port stopped at 4 GiB, so every frame a board
  had above that failed its translate and its consumer failed closed.
* **No user address can name it.** The user region *is* the canonical lower
  half, so the map's slots are unreachable from U-mode by construction — a
  build-time pin in `riscv64.rs`, not a run-time check — and a user leaf in
  one is refused by the walk regardless.
* **A process pays no pages for it.** A root's whole share of the map is its
  own root entries: `install_physmap_slots` copies the published gigapage
  leaves into every root both constructors build, so no space can exist
  without the map and none draws a table for it.

**Installing it.** There is no boot trampoline laying a floor here — the
boot root is built in Rust (step 3) — so the map is installed once, from the
discovered map, with no floor/widen split:

* `mem_map::direct_map_gib` takes the top of the highest **usable** region
  rounded up to a gigabyte, floored at zero and capped at
  `paging::MAX_PHYSMAP_GIB`. The floor is zero rather than an MMIO window
  because this kernel is identity-linked: the board MMIO and firmware
  tables the boot path has already read stay on the identity window, which
  every root it can execute under carries anyway, so the map owes them
  nothing.
* `paging::install_boot_physmap` publishes the extent and its leaves
  set-once and patches them into the live root, reached through the frame
  source that drew it (`table_at`) rather than by dereferencing a physical
  address. It fails closed (`BootError::DirectMapInstall`): a kernel that
  cannot address its own RAM refuses to boot rather than discovering it as
  an allocation failure later.
* The step sits immediately after the memory map is built and before
  anything reaches a frame, and the boot hart runs alone there, so the local
  `sfence.vma` is the whole publication.

`identity_gigapages()` is the one definition of the 4 GiB window every
*process* root carries, for the kernel's own identity-linked image, stack,
leaked state, and board MMIO. That is a bound on where the hardware puts
those things, not a capacity — and a board whose kernel image ends above it
is refused at boot (`BootError::KernelAboveIdentityWindow`) rather than
faulting on the first switch into a task's root.

RAM above `MAX_PHYSMAP_GIB` (191 GiB) is unreachable by pointer, the
early-boot RAM self-test reports it as `unreachable_bytes`, and every
consumer of such a frame fails closed. That ceiling is the Sv39 layout, not
a policy.

`tests/integration/physmap_qemu_riscv64` proves it end to end: a 3072 MiB
guest (the `virt` board bases RAM at `0x8000_0000`, so its RAM tops out at
5 GiB and clears the old four-gigabyte window) boots the production
pipeline, and the observer requires that the map was sized past that window,
that the RAM self-test left **no** usable byte unreachable, and that the
live structure holds — the hardware reading a known frame back through the
map, the map's slot disjoint from every user address, a user leaf refused in
it, and a high physical address resolving to nothing under a process root. A
failing structural check names itself on the serial, so a regression reports
its cause rather than a bare non-zero exit.

### Kthread kernel stacks and their guard page

A kthread's kernel stack is a run of pages in the **shared kernel remap
window** (`kernel/mem::KernelVirtMap`), laid out low-to-high as
`[guard slot | usable stack]`. The guard slot is reserved by the tier and
never mapped, so an overrun off the bottom of the usable region takes a
synchronous store page fault instead of corrupting the lower-addressed
neighbour.

The window's sub-hierarchy is installed by every translation root, so the
guard is absent in **all** roots at once. Nothing refines a leaf for it, and
no root carries a per-task unmap.

That is why the port no longer carries a block-split primitive.
Re-expressing a coarse Sv39 leaf preserves each address's output and
permissions but changes the *granule* it translates at, and a hart holding
the coarse translation can fault a walk the tables plainly satisfy — a
break-before-make violation on a root that is already the active regime,
bounded by a whole-hart `sfence.vma` but not removed by it. A guard that is
never mapped needs no refinement, no unmap, and no maintenance, so
`split_block`, `prepare_guard_arena`, the `BlockSplit` declaration, and the
physical guard arena they served are gone (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D81,
D82).

The tier lives in `kernel/core::kstack`, is architecture-neutral, and is
installed from the one boot site that also installs the heap's growth source
so the two share the window without overlapping. Its allocation path is
`kstack::alloc_kernel_stack`, which every kthread stack comes from; a window
the port did not supply leaves every stack on the software-canary `BoxStack`
fallback, fail closed.

Sv39 permits caching an *invalid* entry, so the window declares
`publish_needs_remote()` and an installation fences the other harts over
exactly the installed run — see the cross-CPU shootdown section.

### Proving the overrun fault-form

`stack_overrun_qemu_riscv64` (the sibling of
`stack_overrun_qemu_{aarch64,x86_64}`) proves the production fault-form: an
overrunning kthread takes a **synchronous store page fault while running**
under the live scheduler, not the deferred next-reschedule poison-canary
detection a heap-backed `tairix_kernel_core::kthread::BoxStack` falls back
to.

It reserves the kernel remap window, builds an Sv39 `AddressSpace`
identity-mapping the low 4 GiB (which installs the window's shared slots),
installs the S-mode trap vector + a `fault` handler, turns paging on,
installs the window-backed stack tier, and draws one stack from it through
the production `kstack::alloc_kernel_stack` — checking the run came from the
window (a `BoxStack` fallback would have handed back heap memory) and that
its usable run is writable. It then builds the live
`tairix-kernel-sched-eevdf` `Scheduler` over `RiscvArch` and admits a kthread
on that stack via `kernel_core::spawn_kthread_with_stack` — the production
runtime path, not a bare call. The body overruns by writing the highest byte
of its guard slot (the first byte a contiguous downward overrun crosses);
because that slot is unmapped the access raises a synchronous store page
fault (`scause` 15) *while the kthread runs* — the trap is taken on the
still-healthy usable stack above the guard, so the S-mode trap vector does
not nest-fault. The handler confirms the cause and that `stval` lies in the
guard slot, and writes the `SiFive` Test PASS finisher. A slot left mapped
lets the body return cleanly; the cooperative `step` loop then drains the
task and the test reports FAILURE explicitly rather than passing.
