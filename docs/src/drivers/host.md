# Userland driver host (`tairix-drvhost`)

`tairix-drvhost` is the userland service that owns the lifecycle of every
`.rxe` driver module on a running TAIRiX system. It is the single point at
which an image is parsed, verified, capability-checked, and handed an
environment to register itself against (`AGENTS.md` §8). The host runs in
user space by default (`AGENTS.md` §4); the same code path also services
`kind = "in-kernel"` drivers by demanding `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` in addition to
the universal `CAP_DRV_LOAD`.

## Public surface

```rust
use tairix_drvhost::{Host, HostConfig, HostError, ImageSource, DriverSpawner};

fn drive_one_module(deps: &ServiceDeps) -> Result<(), HostError> {
    let cfg = HostConfig {
        trusted_signers: &[/* Ed25519PublicKey ... */],
        syscall_table_hash: [/* SHA-256 of the kernel's syscall table */],
        accepted_abi_version: tairix_abi::ABI_VERSION_CURRENT,
        source: &deps.source,   // impl ImageSource
        spawner: &deps.spawner, // impl DriverSpawner
        sink: &deps.audit_sink, // impl tairix_log::Sink
    };
    let mut host = Host::new(cfg);

    let handle = host.load("/d/my-driver", &deps.caller_caps)?;
    // ... driver is now live ...
    let new_handle = host.reload(handle, &deps.caller_caps)?;
    host.unload(new_handle)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The types above, with the loaded-driver snapshot, the parsed image, the
spawn context and the signed-store scan, are the public surface; everything
else (envelope splitter, signature primitive, audit emitter) is internal and
covered by unit tests in the crate itself.

### Trust anchor

`HostConfig::trusted_signers` is the *closed* list of Ed25519 public keys
the host accepts. A manifest signed by any key not on this list is
refused with `HostError::UntrustedSigner` *before* signature verification
is even attempted. There is no notion of "trust on first use" — adding
or removing a trust anchor requires restarting the host process.

### Syscall table fingerprint

`HostConfig::syscall_table_hash` is the SHA-256 of the kernel's encoded
syscall table (the same hash `lib/abi`'s `ENCODED_TABLE` produces and
`kernel/syscall::table` independently stores). A manifest carrying any
other value is refused with `HostError::SyscallHashMismatch`; this is
how `abi-vN` binaries are detected on an `abi-vM` host (`AGENTS.md` §9).

### Image source

`ImageSource::read(path, buf) -> Result<(), Errno>` is the abstraction
over `.rxe` storage. Production deployments wire it to the filesystem
driver; tests wire it to an in-memory map; the Stage 4 QEMU integration
test wires it to a `.rodata` blob baked in by `build.rs`. `path` is an
opaque `&str` chosen by the caller; the host stores it verbatim so that
`reload(handle)` can re-fetch the same image without re-deriving its
location.

### Driver spawner

`DriverSpawner::spawn_and_register(ctx) -> Result<DriverHandle,
SpawnRegisterError>` is the seam at which a verified manifest's
registration is completed in its own protection domain. The
`SpawnContext` carries the verified manifest, the image payload, the
granted-capability `DriverHost` view, and the granted capability set as
a value (`SpawnContext.granted` — what `ctx.host` answers
`has_capability` from, surfaced so a process-spawning spawner can create
the driver with exactly that authority and no more, `AGENTS.md` §4). The
production implementation (`PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW) spawns the payload into
a fresh process (`kernel/mem::build_process_image` → spawn) and completes
the `register()` handshake over IPC; tests and QEMU verticals register a
known entry point in-process through `ctx.host`. The seam returns the
*outcome* of registration rather than an entry point, so the host
never holds a pointer into the driver image.

The `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/driver_spawn_loader.rs` `SpawnDriverLoader`
is the production process-spawning loader: it implements the device
manager's `DriverLoader` seam, so the autoload walk drives it directly,
runs this same `Host::load` gate on the discovered `kind = UserSpace`
image, and spawns the verified payload through the architecture
`DriverProcessSpawn` seam — minting the new process one device-resource
grant per `HwResource` its matched hardware-tree node requested
(`KernelSpawnCtx.grants`, `AGENTS.md` §18.3) and nothing more. The
`tests/integration/driver_spawn_qemu_aarch64` vertical proves that full
devmgr → signed-gate → spawn → grant path on the `virt` board (a virtio
node stands in for the metal controller).

The IPC half of that handshake is defined: the spawned driver reads
the reply endpoint id from its startup arguments (`tairix_rt::arg`),
encodes a
[`DriverRegisterReply`](../abi/driver_traits.md#driverregisterreply)
(`registered(handle)` / `failed(error)`), and sends it with the
`tairix-rt` `ipc_send` wrapper; the host decodes it fail-closed and
treats the reported handle as informational only (it mints its own).

The kernel-side spawn path behind that handshake is in place on
aarch64: the parameterised driver spawn is the `kernel/core`
`ProcessSpawn::spawn_with(rxe, ctx, caps, args)` trait method — the
driver-spawn analogue of `spawn(EmbeddedProgram, ctx)`, taking the
verified image bytes, the manifest∩caller capability set, and the
matched node's grants riding on `ctx` (§18.3). Exposing it on the trait
lets a scheduler-agnostic caller (a generic `kernel_main` holding `&dyn
ProcessSpawn`) spawn a driver without naming the port's spawn mechanism
or the selected scheduler (`AGENTS.md` §17.1 / §17.4); the default fails
closed with `Errno::NotImplemented` (§2.9). The aarch64 producer
(`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/aarch64/spawn_producer.rs`) implements it —
the `spawn` syscall path delegates to it with the fixed session grant —
and `kernel/core` exports `KernelSpawnCtx`, the same admit context the
`spawn` syscall
handler uses (scheduler admit, capability-record insert, address-space
+ standard-stream + resource-limit registration, parent/child wait
link) — so a kernel-side (host-driven) driver spawn drives the
identical production path. The
`tests/integration/driver_spawn_qemu_aarch64` vertical proves the full
chain on the `virt` board: a verified `/System/Drivers/` payload is
spawned with driver-class capabilities and the reply endpoint id in
`arg(1)`; the stub completes the register reply over the production,
capability-gated `ipc_send` path while the host side polls
`Port::recv` under a bounded cooperative budget.

The spawner is *only* invoked after every other verification gate has
cleared (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 — fail closed): a misbehaving spawner
cannot widen the host's authority. Those gates are, in order: image
parse, syscall-table hash, signature (over header, capability body,
bind table, *and* the payload — so a `kind = UserSpace` driver's program
is authenticated, never substitutable after signing, `AGENTS.md` §8 /
§2.17), capability subset/kind checks, and a fail-closed
decode of every
[`DriverBindKey`](../abi/driver_traits.md#driverbindkey) bind-table
entry — a malformed table never reaches the device manager
(`AGENTS.md` §18.3).

### What a registering driver is handed

The host's driver view carries the driver's granted capabilities and its
kind, and nothing else: it lends no DMA host and no register mapper. A
driver that drives hardware does so from its own process, where `lib/drvrt`'s
`RtDriverHost` lends it the capability-gated DMA and `MmioMapper` seams
(`DriverHost::mmio_mapper`), and the in-kernel floor drivers are handed
theirs by the floor bring-up that drives their device (`root_unlock`), so a
load through this gate never widens what a driver can reach.

### In-kernel floor admission

The bootstrap floor's block drivers — the ones that read the volume holding
the signed driver store — are statically linked into the kernel, and each is
admitted through the `Host::load` gate before it drives hardware:
`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/driver_loader.rs`'s `KernelDriverLoader` runs the
full pipeline (manifest parse, syscall-table-hash match, trust-anchor and
Ed25519 signature check, the `CAP_DRV_LOAD` / `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` gates,
bind-table validation) and then the driver's in-process `register()`. The
signed manifests and the trust anchor are produced at build time by
`build.rs` (`emit_signed_driver_manifests`): each `DriverManifest` is `kind =
InKernel`, stamped with the kernel's `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH`, requests
`CAP_DRV_LOAD`, carries the driver crate's own `BIND_KEYS`, and is
Ed25519-signed with the build's deterministic driver-signing key
(`KERNEL_DRIVER_SIGNING_SEED`); the matching public key is embedded as the
kernel's sole driver trust anchor. The seed has a single home in
`kernel/tairix-kernel/src/build_support.rs`, so an image build that lays a
kernel-trusted bundle into the driver store signs from the same definition
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). Secrecy of the seed buys nothing (`AGENTS.md` §19.3): it
is committed, and the signatures stay bit-reproducible. Every other driver —
the Pi 4's PCIe, VL805 and xHCI drivers among them — is a signed
`/System/Drivers/` bundle the device manager autoloads into user space.

### Signed-store scan

TAIRiX ships no compiled-in list of *which* drivers exist: the
discovered driver set is found at runtime by scanning the installed
signed bundles under `/System/Drivers/` (`AGENTS.md` §18.6). The
`tairix_drvhost::store` module is that scan. Given the bundle paths a
caller enumerated (a VFS directory walk of `/System/Drivers/` in
production; the bin-crate boot wiring is the one layer that may name
both `drvhost` and `devmgr`, `AGENTS.md` §17.4) and an `ImageSource`,
`scan_store(source, paths, sink) -> DriverStore` reads each bundle,
parses its `.rxe` manifest with the same `ParsedImage` splitter the
load gate uses (so the match data can never drift from the gate's view
of the bytes, `AGENTS.md` §2.2), and decodes its bind table fail-closed.
Each accepted bundle becomes an owned `ScannedDriver`, and
`DriverStore::candidates()` lends the borrowed `DriverCandidate` slice
that `tairix_devmgr::DeviceManager::autoload` matches against the
hardware tree.

The scan is a **match** step only and grants no authority. Building a
candidate from a bundle's bind table is *necessary but never
sufficient* to run it: the Ed25519 signature, syscall-hash, capability
set, and `kind` are still verified by the load gate (`Host::load`)
when — and only when — that candidate wins a hardware-tree node
(`AGENTS.md` §18.6). A bundle that is unreadable, has a malformed
manifest, or whose bind table fails to decode is **skipped and logged**,
never fatal: one bad bundle cannot block the rest of the boot
(`AGENTS.md` §18.4 / §5.4).

#### Reading the bundle bytes off the scanned volume

In production the bundle bytes live in the §16.2 `/System/Drivers/` store.
The store path is taken **relative to the root of the volume being
scanned**, passed explicitly as a `store_root` argument: a whole-root
volume uses `tairix_kernel_core::DRIVER_STORE_PATH` (`/System/Drivers`),
while the design-B dedicated `/System` volume — whose own root *is*
`/System` — uses `tairix_kernel_core::SYSTEM_VOLUME_STORE_PATH`
(`/Drivers`). The kernel finds *which* paths exist with
`tairix_kernel_core::enumerate_driver_store(fs, store_root, audit)` (a
§5.3-checked VFS walk under the uid-0 bootstrap identity), and reads the
bytes of a chosen bundle with `tairix_kernel_core::DriverImageReader`: it
builds the root-backed VFS **once** (`AGENTS.md` §2.16), then per call
validates that the path lies strictly within that same `store_root`,
bounds the file against `MAX_DRIVER_IMAGE_LEN` (a 16 MiB §24.4 validation
cap) *before* reading a byte, reads the whole file, and **appends** it to
the caller's buffer — failing closed and leaving the buffer untouched on
any refusal (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §2.9). Every read runs under the uid-0,
no-capability bootstrap identity: a bundle is reachable only because its
stored §5.3 record makes it readable to that identity, never through an
ambient bypass (`AGENTS.md` §5.1).

The `ImageSource` trait lives in `drvhost` (userland), and the §17.4
layering forbids `kernel/core` from depending on it, so the bin crate —
the one layer that may name `drvhost` — supplies the read-only `/System`
file service `tairix_kernel::system_files::SystemFileService`. It is the
one object over the mounted `/System` volume that both **lists** the store
(`list_store`, delegating to `enumerate_driver_store`) and **reads** a
bundle's bytes (an `ImageSource`, delegating to `DriverImageReader`). It
holds the `DriverImageReader` plus the root-volume filesystem driver
(behind a `RefCell`, because `ImageSource::read` is `&self` while the
driver needs `&mut`; the list-then-read sequence is single-threaded and
pulls one bundle at a time, so the borrow never overlaps) and adds no
authority of its own. Consolidating the listing and the reads behind this
one seam (`AGENTS.md` §2.2) is what the Design-D D2b-2 `/System` file-read
`IPC_RECV` endpoint wraps, rather than re-deriving the read path.

#### Autoloading by discovery

`tairix_kernel::driver_autoload::autoload_drivers` is the one boot-wiring
composition that turns the discovered hardware tree and the installed
signed store into running user-space drivers — the "drivers in user space
by discovery" steady state (`AGENTS.md` §4 / §18). It adds no policy of its
own; it threads the building blocks above together:

1. `drvhost::store::scan_store` reads each `/System/Drivers/` bundle path
   (from the service's `list_store`) through the `SystemFileService`
   `ImageSource` and decodes its manifest bind table fail-closed — a
   **match** step only (§18.6).
2. `devmgr::DeviceManager::autoload` resolves every tree node against those
   candidates through the shared `lib/devmatch` policy (§18.3), leaving an
   unmatched node unbound and logged (§18.4).
3. Each winning node's driver is loaded through
   `tairix_kernel::driver_spawn_loader::SpawnDriverLoader`, which runs the
   signed `Host::load` gate and **spawns** the verified payload into its own
   process, minting it one device-resource grant per `HwResource` the
   matched node requested — and nothing more (§18.3 / §4).

A candidate that fails the signed gate fails *that node* closed and the
walk continues, so one bad bundle never blocks the boot (§5.4 / §23.1). The
function lives in the kernel binary — the one layer that may name both
`devmgr` and `drvhost` (§17.4) — and is the staged production entry the boot
path drives once the root volume that backs the store is mounted in
production (`plans/PI.md` P10 5d-2-ii "Remaining").

Under Design D (`plans/PI.md`) matching *policy* lives in the long-running
user-space `devmgr` service, and the kernel keeps only the *mechanism*: the
disk-owning unlock kthread mounts the read-only `/System` volume and serves
its signed driver store over a capability-gated IPC endpoint (`list` / read,
fail-closed, §5.4), and exposes the discovered hardware tree
(`hw_tree_read` / `hw_tree_wait`). `devmgr` reads the tree, lists the store
over the service, resolves each node against the decoded candidates with the
shared `lib/devmatch` policy (§18.3), and asks the kernel to load each
winner; the kernel re-runs the full signed `Host::load` gate and spawns the
verified payload through `tairix_kernel::driver_spawn_loader::SpawnDriverLoader`,
minting one device-resource grant per `HwResource` the matched node requested
— and nothing more (§18.3 / §4). The `/System` volume holds no secrets; its
store's integrity rests on the per-bundle Ed25519 signatures the load gate
verifies (§18.6).

The `tests/integration/autoload_input_qemu_aarch64` `-M virt` vertical
proves this end to end on the production boot path: it plants a kernel-signed
`virtio_kbd` driver bundle in the read-only `/System` volume's `Drivers/`
store (the shared encrypted-root image fixture, planted with the autoload
driver bundles the `image_drivers` pipeline cross-compiles and signs) and
attaches a
`virtio-keyboard` device. The discovered virtio-input node carries its
register window, a coherent DMA constraint, and its discovered GICv2
interrupt line as grant requests (§18.3); `devmgr` matches the signed bundle
to it and requests the load, the kernel signature-verifies and spawns it into
its own user-space process, and the autoloaded driver maps its window, brings
the device up, **binds its granted interrupt line and parks on `irq_wait`**
(interrupt-driven, never a busy poll — §2.1 / §2.16). The injected keystroke
is decoded and delivered to the input-focus arbiter, and the run passes on the
one-shot `AuditEvent::InputDelivered` witness (`EventId(4050)`, `AGENTS.md`
§20). The load presents `unlock_service::autoload_caps` (the kthread's minimal
`service_caps` plus the delegatable per-class resource capabilities its
rustdoc enumerates — the one authoritative definition), so the input
driver's manifest∩caller intersection grants exactly the injection authority
`key_inject` requires and the `irq_bind`/`irq_wait` authority its
interrupt-driven event loop parks on — and nothing the kthread holds ambiently
(§5.2 / §5.4).

### Audit sink

Every state transition emits one structured `tairix_log::Event` with a
stable `EventId` from `tairix_drvhost::events`:

| `EventId` | Meaning                                              |
|----------:|------------------------------------------------------|
| `7001`    | driver loaded                                        |
| `7002`    | load rejected — manifest decode failed               |
| `7003`    | load rejected — syscall table hash mismatch          |
| `7004`    | load rejected — signer key not on trust anchor list  |
| `7005`    | load rejected — Ed25519 signature verification failed |
| `7006`    | load rejected — requested capabilities exceed caller |
| `7007`    | load rejected — `InKernel` without `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`  |
| `7008`    | load rejected — caller lacks `CAP_DRV_LOAD`          |
| `7009`    | load rejected — spawner has no driver for manifest   |
| `7010`    | load rejected — driver `register()` returned an error |
| `7011`    | load rejected — bind-table entry failed to decode    |
| `7020`    | driver unloaded                                      |
| `7021`    | driver reloaded                                      |
| `7030`    | signed-store bundle accepted as autoload candidate   |
| `7031`    | signed-store bundle skipped during scan              |

The identifiers are part of the `7000..8000` range reserved for the
driver host (`AGENTS.md` §2.5). They are pinned by an in-tree
uniqueness test and may never be re-numbered.

## Error mapping

`HostError::as_errno(self) -> tairix_abi::Errno` is total: every
variant has a stable counterpart in `abi-v1`. Callers wrapping the host
behind a syscall surface the result without inventing new error codes.
A failed registration keeps its cause: `DriverRegisterFailed(e)` maps
through `DriverError::as_errno`, except `Busy`, which at the load gate
means another live driver holds the node and reads as `Errno::Busy`, so the
device manager can tell a removal race (`DeviceOffline`) or an
already-driven node from a refused image.

## Stability tier

`experimental` (`AGENTS.md` §6). The wire formats consumed (manifest
header, capability body, and bind table) are pinned by `lib/abi`'s
`DriverManifest` / `DriverBindKey`; the host's own public Rust API
freezes once Stage 4 lands its first real driver.

## Security model

The host never decides on its own that a caller is authorised. Every
`load` takes the caller's `CapabilitySet` explicitly, intersects the
driver's request against it, and refuses any superset (`AGENTS.md`
§5.2 — capabilities can be delegated but never widened). The
host-owned `DriverHandle` is the unforgeable proof that a load
succeeded; the value the driver's `register()` returned is informational
only and never replaces the host's freshly minted handle.

Buffers that held the manifest signature or capability bitmap are
wiped through a volatile clear primitive (`zeroize::secure_clear`)
before their backing allocation is freed (`AGENTS.md` §4).
