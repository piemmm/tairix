# DMA-engine drivers

A DMA controller moves data between memory and other devices' FIFOs, so that
an audio, SPI, SD or UART driver can stream without the CPU copying each word.
`HwDeviceClass::Dma` names the class and its drivers live under
`drivers/dma/<leaf>/`. The staged design is `plans/SOUND.md` §The DMA-engine
seam (SND5); this page is the class view of what exists.

## Who may write a control block

A controller fetches control blocks from memory, and a control block holds
bus addresses. With no IOMMU between the controller and RAM, whoever writes
one can read and write all of memory. The controller's driver is therefore
the only process that maps the controller's registers or writes its control
blocks, and a consumer driver never supplies an address. It quotes claims the
kernel attests:

- its **request line**, a `DmaRequest` grant discovery built from its node's
  `dmas` entry, which the controller checks the calling process holds;
- its **FIFO**, a CPU-physical address inside one of its own register
  windows, which the controller translates through its own DMA window.

The buffer comes back as a shared-memory grant the controller carved under
its own addressing constraint, so every block's memory side lies inside that
channel's own buffer by construction.

## Discovery

The shared device-tree walk reads the generic DMA binding for every FDT port.

- **A controller** is any node with `#dma-cells`. It carries a
  `DmaController` duty naming its endpoint — one per controller node, from
  the reserved `DMA_CONTROLLER_ENDPOINTS` block indexed by node id — and the
  channels the tree leaves to this system (`dma-channel-mask`, numbered from
  the node's own first channel, or a port's vendor spelling converted to
  that numbering). The duty records whether the tree stated a mask at all.
- **Its windows**: one `Dma` resource per window its buses compose to
  (`tairix_fdt::dma_reach`): each bus's `dma-ranges` clips and rebases the
  windows of the buses below it, splitting where an entry boundary changes the
  offset, and an empty property is the identity at its own bus only. Each
  window carries the bus address it starts at and is flagged `DMA_TRANSLATED`,
  so one starting at bus `0` is never read as an untranslated limit. A
  controller with nothing on the way that translates reaches memory
  untranslated and gets one unconstrained window; a bus with no property maps
  nothing.
- **A consumer's request lines**: each `dmas` entry becomes a `DmaRequest`
  naming its controller's endpoint, the specifier in the controller's own
  binding (up to two cells — a wider entry is dropped, never truncated), the
  entry's position, and its `dma-names` string where that fits eight bytes.
  A phandle resolves to the id the walk gives its controller by replaying the
  walk's emission rule, so a consumer met before its controller still names
  the right endpoint.

A `DmaRequest` grant covers *calling* its controller's endpoint and never
binding it, so no consumer can serve the rendezvous every other consumer of
that controller calls. Both record kinds decode only from their canonical
encoding, so a record a controller receives quoted re-encodes to exactly the
bytes the kernel holds as the caller's grant.

## `dmaengine-v1`

`tairix_abi::driver::dmaengine` is the controller endpoint's protocol. Every
frame is exact-length and every decode total.

| Operation | Carries | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `Open` | the caller's request line | the lowest free channel the mask allows, at most one per request |
| `Prepare` | channel, FIFO, direction, period bytes, periods | the grant for the caller's mapping of the buffer, and the controller instance that delegated it |
| `Start` | channel | — |
| `Stop` | channel | — (abort, then channel reset) |
| `Position` | channel | the live memory-side offset |
| `Close` | channel | — |
| `Wait` | channel, a byte position | a report at the first period boundary past it |

`Wait` is a posted call. Its report carries the monotone byte position and
the controller's monotonic clock when it serviced the event, and says whether
the wait ended at a boundary, because the channel stopped, or because it
faulted with the controller's own error bits.

A transfer is cyclic: `Prepare` builds one interrupting block per period
over a buffer holding the periods end to end, looping until stopped. A
buffer holds at least two periods (`DMA_CYCLIC_MIN_PERIODS`), because the
controller counts boundaries by which period its channel has reached. The
seam has no pause, because a paused request-paced transfer starves its
peripheral, and no memory-to-memory or one-shot scatter-gather transfer.

The kernel binds a delegated mapping to the process that delegated it, so the
consumer maps the buffer with `shm_map_from`, naming the grantor the reply
carries; a grantor that did not delegate the grant maps nothing.

## The endpoint

`DmaEngine` and `DmaChannel` are the class traits a controller driver
implements: the channels its register window describes, the request-line
binding it serves, and per channel the chain, start, stop, position and the
events its interrupt raised. The endpoint is written once over them and holds
every rule the protocol makes:

- A channel belongs to the process instance that opened it; any other caller
  is refused. A line whose holder has ended is reclaimed by its next holder,
  but while the holder lives the line stays its own, since two nodes may
  carry the same line.
- A request line counts only once `call_peer_holds` attests the caller holds
  it, and a FIFO only once it attests a register window covering the whole
  peripheral-side access; the FIFO is then translated through the
  controller's own windows, and a FIFO no window reaches is refused.
- Every buffer is carved by the endpoint, after every check has passed.
- A posted `Wait` is answered at the first boundary past the position it
  names. Boundaries are counted by which period the channel has reached, so
  coalesced interrupts stay exact and a boundary passed while no wait was
  posted is answered at once. A service late by a whole lap of the buffer is
  the one thing this cannot see; the consumer, which knows its stream's rate,
  sees it in the service times.
- A consumer that ends has its channels stopped and released. A wait that
  cannot be answered is taken for one that has, and stops the channel.
- The device is stopped before the endpoint unmaps a buffer, and a chain is
  freed only after its channel's reset.

Every claim, reclaim, refusal, fault, lost position, abandoned channel and
undrained reset is recorded with a stable event id.

## `drivers/dma/bcm2835`

The Broadcom legacy engines (`brcm,bcm2835-dma`). The node's register window
holds one `0x100` block per channel; the tree's `brcm,dma-channel-mask`
says which of them this system may use, and the driver touches no other.
Channel `n`'s interrupt is the node's `n`-th, so lines a binding shares
(channels 7/8 and 9/10 on the Pi 4) are bound once and serve both.

At bring-up the driver resets every channel it serves before it declares the
device quiesced, so a chain a dead instance left running is stopped before
its memory leaves quarantine. It reaches peripherals through the translated
window covering its own registers and carves from the others.

The specifier is the downstream binding's one cell. Bits 4:0 are the DREQ,
which must be non-zero; AXI priority (19:16), panic priority (23:20),
wait-for-outstanding-writes (28) and no-debug-pause (29) go to the channel's
`CS`; wide source (24), wide destination (25), no write-response wait (27)
and burst (30, a burst length of 3) shape each control block. Any other bit
refuses the line.

A chain is at most one page of control blocks, and every block moves at most
a LITE channel's 65 532 bytes, rounded down to the transfer unit, so a shape
is admitted or refused whichever channel serves it. A stop pauses the channel,
lets its outstanding writes drain within a bounded budget, and resets it; the
reset is issued even when the drain runs out, and that is recorded.

The fault bits a `Wait` reports are `CS.ERROR` (bit 8) with `DEBUG`'s three
error flags (bits 2:0).

## Kernel mechanisms

- **The endpoint is the duty holder's alone.** Binding an id in
  `DMA_CONTROLLER_ENDPOINTS` requires holding the `DmaController` duty that
  names it — not merely the privileged bind — because every consumer holds a
  request line naming the same id, and one of them serving it would answer
  all the others.
- **`call_peer_holds`** answers whether the caller being served holds a grant
  covering a quoted record, so the controller checks a request line, or a
  FIFO's register window, against the kernel's grants rather than the
  client's word. Only the duty holder may ask, and only about those two:
  a request line naming its own endpoint, or an MMIO window.
- **`shm_create_dma`** carves a channel's buffer below the controller's own
  `Dma` window, mapped coherent in every process that maps it, and returns
  the bus address the controller programs; **`shm_grant_peer`** mints that
  buffer to the client whose call is being served.
- **The buffer outlives a crash safely.** The controller keeps its own
  mapping while a channel may master the buffer — its unmap is its word that
  the device is done — and should it end still mapping it, the buffer joins
  its node's quarantine when the client lets go, freed only after the next
  instance declares the controller reset.

## Status

The protocol, the class traits, the endpoint and `drivers/dma/bcm2835` exist,
host-proven against a register-level model of the engines. QEMU models no
cyclic DREQ-paced chain, so the driver's metal acceptance is the first
consumer's transfer on a Pi 4 (`plans/SOUND.md` SND8). DMA4
(`brcm,bcm2711-dma`) arrives with SND19.
