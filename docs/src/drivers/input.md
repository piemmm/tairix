# Input drivers

Input drivers report user-generated events — keyboard, pointer, and
scroll — to the focused session. They implement
[`tairix_abi::driver::input::Input`](../abi/driver_traits.md#input) and
run as user-space drivers. For the **desktop** path, key repeat,
modifier/lock state, keymap translation, and routing to a surface live
above this trait in `userland/gui/wm` and the session layer. For a
**text console**, a keyboard driver instead translates its key events
to console bytes itself and injects them through the `console_input`
syscall (see "Console-input producer" below); key repeat remains a
higher-layer concern either way.

## Class trait

`Input` is a single method:

| Method   | Purpose                                   | Capability gate          |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `poll`   | drain pending events into a caller buffer | `DriverHandle` ownership |

Each `InputEvent` carries a `kind` (`Key`, `Pointer`, or `Scroll`), a
`code` (keycode or axis index), and a `value` (press/release or signed
delta). Per `AGENTS.md` §2.9 the trait never panics: an empty buffer
maps to `DriverError::BufferTooSmall`.

### `tairix-drv-input-ps2`

The PS/2 keyboard driver reads the Intel 8042 keyboard controller that
every x86 PC and QEMU's default `q35`/`i440fx` machines expose: a
status/command register at I/O port `0x64` and a data register at
`0x60`. It is a keyboard driver; the auxiliary (mouse) port is left to
a future pointer driver.

The driver never issues an `inb`/`outb` itself. It reaches the two
ports through the host-supplied `PortIo8` 8-bit port seam, which the
x86_64 architecture port implements (`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / §17.4). It
therefore carries no architecture `cfg` and no ambient authority over
the I/O port space (`AGENTS.md` §4).

`poll` reads the status register and, while the output buffer holds a
keyboard byte, consumes and decodes a scancode-set-1 byte stream into
platform-neutral keycodes: the base make code (`1..=0x7F`) for
unprefixed keys and `0xE000 | make` for `E0`-extended keys, with
`value == 1` for a press and `0` for a release. An `E0` prefix that
arrives at the end of one drain is latched and paired with its code on
the next `poll`. The drain stops at an empty buffer, at an auxiliary
byte (which it does **not** consume), at a full caller buffer, or when
a per-call read budget is exhausted — so a stuck controller can never
make the driver spin (`AGENTS.md` §2.1).

Lifecycle: `register` clears `CAP_DRV_LOAD`; `Ps2Keyboard::new` binds
the driver to the controller ports without performing any I/O; dropping
the `Ps2Keyboard` releases the backend (unload); constructing a fresh
instance reloads. The driver issues the controller no commands, so
unload leaves no state to quiesce.

QEMU integration on a live controller is exercised by
`tests/integration/ps2_input_qemu_x86_64` (`tairix-test-ps2-qemu-x86-64`,
enrolled in `cargo xtask test --qemu`). It boots the production kernel,
loads this driver's signed `.rxe` through `tairix_drvhost::Host`, and
drives it through load → use → unload → reload. The boot hand-off it
needed is the x86_64 8-bit port seam
`tairix_arch_x86_64::pio::X86PortIo8` — the byte-wide sibling of the PCI
bus driver's 32-bit `X86PortIo`, supplying the only in-tree
`PortIo8` implementation (`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / §17.4).

"Use" is **interrupt-driven**. The vertical binds the keyboard line
(ISA IRQ-1 → GSI 1) in the production `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable`,
sets the i8042 keyboard-interrupt config bit, masks the legacy 8259
PIC, and unmasks GSI 1 through the published `IoApicController`. It then
makes a keypress deterministic without physical hardware via the i8042
`0xD2` ("write keyboard output buffer") command — injecting a scancode
through the same `PortIo8` backend the driver reads through asserts the
real IRQ-1 line. After `sti` the test waits on `IrqTable::try_wait_step`
until the IO-APIC → LAPIC → IDT → dispatcher → `IrqTable::fire`
round-trip reports `WaitStep::Ready`, then drains the byte through the
driver's `poll`, confirming the decoded press and — after reload — the
matching release. The driver itself stays read-only and polled; the
interrupt only signals *when* a byte is waiting. This shares the
external-IRQ trap glue that `tests/integration/irq_qemu_x86_64`
validates against the PIT.

### `tairix-drv-input-virtio-input`

`tairix-drv-input-virtio-input` is the §8 driver identity — the `register`
entry and the §18.3 `BIND_KEYS` bind table. The reusable open/poll/decode
device logic and the keyboard console producer described below live in the
[`tairix-virtio-input`](../lib/virtio_input.md) library (`lib/virtio_input`),
shared by the in-kernel `-M virt` verticals and the user-space input-driver
process (`tairix-drv-input-virtio-kbd`, below) without a
`drivers/*`→`drivers/*` edge (`AGENTS.md` §17.4 / §2.2 — the virtio analogue of
`lib/hid` ↔ `drivers/input/usb_kbd`).

The virtio-input logic implements `Input` over the bus-agnostic virtio
transport from `lib/virtio`, so one source compiles against both the PCI
and MMIO transports (the queue protocol lives once, `AGENTS.md` §2.2).
It is the paravirtualised input device every QEMU machine type can
present (`virtio-keyboard-device` / `virtio-mouse-device` /
`virtio-tablet-device`) and the input class real virtio hardware
exposes — the `virt`-board analogue of the x86 PS/2 keyboard.

It consumes the device-to-driver **event queue** (queue 0). The wire
record is `struct virtio_input_event { __le16 type; __le16 code;
__le32 value; }` (virtio 1.1 §5.8.6) in the Linux `evdev` namespaces,
which `poll` maps onto the platform-neutral `InputEvent`: `EV_KEY` →
`Key` (the evdev keycode, `value` 1 press / 0 release), `EV_REL` `REL_X`
/ `REL_Y` → `Pointer`, and a wheel → `Scroll` in either encoding a device
uses: `REL_WHEEL` motion, negated because `evdev` counts it away from the user
while the shared axis counts downward, or the `BTN_GEAR_DOWN`/`BTN_GEAR_UP`
presses QEMU's HID pointers send, one detent each. `EV_SYN` frame
separators and any unmodelled `type`/`code` are consumed but surface no
event, so the driver never fabricates a bogus one (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).

`open` runs the virtio 1.1 §3.1 init sequence (negotiating only
`VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1`, the modern split-virtqueue layout) and then
**pre-posts a pool of device-write event buffers**, keyed by the
descriptor head the queue assigns. A single posted buffer is not enough:
the device fills one buffer per event of a report, so a keypress's
`EV_KEY` *and* its trailing `EV_SYN` each need a free buffer at once.
`poll` drains every completed event (interrupt-driven through the host's
IRQ waiter — no busy-spin, `AGENTS.md` §2.1), decodes it, and hands each
buffer straight back so the pool stays full. The driver allocates every
device-visible buffer through the host `VirtioHost` DMA seam and reaches
the device only through the `Transport` seam, so it holds no ambient
authority (`AGENTS.md` §4 / §17.4).

It publishes a canonical `BIND_KEYS` table (`AGENTS.md` §18.3): one
entry matching a probed virtio node whose device id is `virtio-input`
(`HwMatchKey::virtio(18)`) at the exact-match priority tier, the single
source of truth its signed-manifest bind table is authored from and the
data `devmgr` (or the in-kernel bootstrap-floor catalogue) resolves a
discovered virtio-input node against. The key carries no transport
detail, so the same driver binds whether the device is attached over
virtio-MMIO or PCI (`AGENTS.md` §2.2 / §17.4).

QEMU integration on a live device is exercised by
`tests/integration/input_virtio_mmio_qemu_aarch64`
(`tairix-test-input-virtio-mmio-qemu-aarch64`, enrolled in `cargo xtask
test --qemu`). It boots the aarch64 `virt` board, builds the
virtio-MMIO transport from the embedded device tree, arms the GICv2 SPI
+ EL1 IRQ path, mints a `KernelVirtioHost`, loads this driver's signed
`.rxe` through `tairix_drvhost::Host`, and drives it through
load → use → unload → reload. "Use" is a **real injected key**: once the
guest logs its event-queue-armed readiness marker, the QEMU runner
(`tools/qemu`) attaches a `virtio-keyboard-device` and sends a key
through the QEMU monitor (`sendkey`); the eventq IRQ fires and the
driver decodes the press and, after reload, the matching release — the
virtio-input analogue of the PS/2 vertical's `0xD2` injection, with the
event originating device-side rather than guest-side.

The riscv64 `virt`-board sibling
`tests/integration/input_virtio_mmio_qemu_riscv64`
(`tairix-test-input-virtio-mmio-qemu-riscv64`, also enrolled in `cargo
xtask test --qemu`) drives the same driver and the same shared
`virtio_input_keypress` key-decode tail over the riscv64 MMIO bring-up
(PLIC source + S-mode trap path), so a single driver source covers the
`input` row of the QEMU matrix on x86_64 (PS/2), aarch64, and riscv64
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

#### Console-input producer

`lib/virtio_input`'s `VirtioKeyboardConsole` is the keyboard producer half: it
turns the `Key` `InputEvent` edges `poll` decodes (whose `code` is the raw
`evdev` keycode) into the `tairix_abi::input::KeyInput` records a driver injects
through the `key_inject` syscall. It tracks the held modifiers (each of the
eight modifier keys independently, collapsing the left/right pairs) and the
caps-/num-lock toggles, resolves each printable or named key edge into the
`Key` a US keyboard layout produces, and builds the record through the shared
`tairix_keymap::key_input` map — the **one** `Key`→record definition the
`lib/hid` USB console producer reaches too (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The
`evdev`-keycode→`Key` table is `evdev`-specific (a USB HID keyboard decodes HID
usages into the same `Key` vocabulary), so it lives here; everything is
allocation-free and fail-closed — an unknown keycode or a non-key event
produces no record rather than guessing (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).

#### The autoloaded driver binary (`tairix-drv-input-virtio-kbd`)

`drivers/input/virtio_kbd` (`tairix-drv-input-virtio-kbd`, `src/main.rs`) is the
autoloaded **user-space** virtio-input keyboard driver process — the "drivers in
user space" steady state (`AGENTS.md` §4) on the hardware QEMU `-M virt`
presents (the metal Pi 4 keyboard is the USB `tairix-drv-input-usb-kbd`). It is
a freestanding pure-Rust `tairix-rt` program depending only on `lib/*`
(`lib/virtio`, `lib/virtio_input`, `lib/drvrt`, `lib/rt`, `lib/caps`, `lib/abi`)
so the §17.4 layering holds. `main` builds `RtDriverHost::from_grants_query`
over its kernel-issued grants (coherency `None` — coherent DMA, platform-neutral
§2.20), resolves its single granted register window with
`tairix_abi::driver::sole_register_window` over `RtDriverHost::resources()` (the
one definition shared with the USB keyboard driver, §2.2 / §2.16), maps it
through `mmio_map`, builds the bus-agnostic `MmioTransport`, brings the device up
with `VirtioInput::open_armed`, and pumps `poll`, offering each decoded event to
the shared pointer mapping first (`PointerInput::from_device_event` — axis
deltas, `BTN_*` edges, and scroll ticks → `pointer_inject`) and every other event to
`VirtioKeyboardConsole::feed` → `key_inject`; one driver instance is spawned
per discovered virtio-input node (keyboard and mouse alike — the bind table
cannot tell them apart), and each instance's device decides which producer
ever yields a record. The pump is interrupt-driven: `open_armed` runs
`RtDriverHost::bind_irq` on the granted device line as its *arm* step, strictly
after the eventq is live (`DRIVER_OK`, buffers posted, device kicked), so the
audited `irq_bind` syscall is a truthful "keyboard ready" witness — binding any
earlier advertised readiness while the device could still silently drop a
keystroke (the lost keypress that made the autoload-input vertical flaky).
`poll` parks in the kernel
(`irq_wait` through the host's `notify_wait`) while no event is pending and
acknowledges the device each cycle (`Transport::ack_interrupt`), so an idle
keyboard consumes no CPU — never a yield-poll loop (`AGENTS.md` §2.23). That
wait is deliberately **unbounded** (`u64::MAX`): nothing is outstanding and the
next keystroke may genuinely be hours away, so there is no deadline to apply
and a periodic re-poll would only burn power. It is the opposite case to a
*request* wait (a block transfer), which must always carry its device's
per-request deadline, because there the request's own completion is the only
other event that could end the wait. Every
capability and bound is re-checked kernel-side (`AGENTS.md` §5.4); a bring-up
failure exits with a reserved fail-closed code (`80`/`81`/`82`) and a hard
device fault exits `83` rather than spinning on a broken device. It is a
separate crate from the §8
`tairix-drv-input-virtio-input` identity so it can link `tairix-rt` without
pulling it into the kernel-linked driver shell (`AGENTS.md` §2.2 — the `usb_kbd`
analogue).

### The autoloaded driver binary (`tairix-drv-input-usb-kbd`)

The keyboard driver *process* is a **separate crate**,
`drivers/input/usb_kbd` (`tairix-drv-input-usb-kbd`, `src/main.rs`): the
`devmgr`-autoloaded **user-space** keyboard **class driver**, installed as a
signed `/System/Drivers/` bundle (`AGENTS.md` §18, `plans/USB.md` §1.2) — the
"drivers in user space" steady state (`AGENTS.md` §4). It binds the
USB-interface node the host-controller driver (`drivers/bus/usb/xhci`)
publishes for a HID boot-keyboard interface — never the controller node — and
holds **no** controller register grant and **no** DMA grant: its matched
node's only resources are the per-interface URB call endpoint and the shared
report buffer (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 — least privilege). It is a pure-Rust
`tairix-rt` program (`AGENTS.md` §1 / §16.4) whose HID boot-report decode
lives in the shared [`lib/hid`](../lib/hid.md) crate, so the userland runtime
never enters the kernel's dependency graph, and depends only on `lib/*`
crates so the §17.4 layering holds. `main` builds
`tairix_drvrt::RtDriverHost::from_grants_query` over its kernel-issued grants,
takes the endpoint id and maps the shared buffer from them, wraps the
`lib/usb` transport client in a `ReportSource` (`UrbReportSource`: each
`next_report` submits an interrupt-IN URB and reads the completed report out
of the shared buffer), and then pumps the keyboard forever with
`tairix_hid::pump_once`, injecting each produced key record into the seat's
input routing through the `key_inject` syscall. Each pump is a blocking URB `ipc_call` the
host-controller driver answers only when the controller's completion
interrupt delivers a report, so the driver parks in the kernel between
keystrokes — never a busy poll (`AGENTS.md` §2.23) — and repeated pump errors
exit fail-closed after a bounded budget, leaving the console without a
keyboard rather than wedged (`AGENTS.md` §2.9). A device disconnect retracts
the interface node, `devmgr` unloads this driver, and a re-plug autoloads a
fresh instance onto a fresh node, whose shared buffer is new. This bundle is installed into the
image `/System/Drivers/` store and autoloaded by `devmgr` against the
discovered HID interface node; QEMU models no Pi USB, so the live autoload +
keystroke is the metal acceptance item (`plans/PI.md` §0.4).

### The autoloaded driver binary (`tairix-drv-input-usb-mouse`)

`drivers/input/usb_mouse` (`tairix-drv-input-usb-mouse`, `src/main.rs`) is the
USB HID boot-**mouse** sibling of the keyboard class driver: the same signed
`/System/Drivers/` bundle shape, the same least-privilege capability set
(`CAP_INPUT_INJECT`, `CAP_SHM`, `CAP_IPC_ENDPOINT`, `CAP_LOG_EMIT` — no MMIO,
DMA, or IRQ), and the same blocking URB transport pump. Its `BIND_KEYS` match
the HID boot-mouse interface key (`usb(0, 0, 0x03_01_02)`), so `devmgr`
autoloads it against the mouse interface node the host-controller driver
emits — a keyboard and a mouse plugged in together are each served by their
own class driver over their own per-interface transport (the engine's
concurrent-device table; see the `lib/usb`
`bring_up_serves_a_keyboard_and_a_mouse_behind_the_hub_together` regression).
Each report is decoded through `tairix_hid::BootMouse` (button edges diffed
against the previous report, X/Y deltas, and the wheel negated onto the shared
downward axis), and every decoded event is
translated by the one shared device→seat mapping
`PointerInput::from_device_event` — the same mapping the virtio pointer path
uses, so the two can never diverge — and injected through `pointer_inject`.
Motion, button edges, and scroll ticks all inject now that the desktop
scrollbar consumes scroll; only an event outside the pointer vocabulary
maps to nothing and is never fabricated (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).
Disconnect/reload and the fail-closed error
budget behave exactly as the keyboard driver's; the live report path is the
Pi 4 metal acceptance item.
