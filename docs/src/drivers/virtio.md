# Virtio transport

The bus-agnostic virtqueue protocol lives in `lib/virtio`
(crate `tairix-virtio`), together with the concrete virtio-MMIO
`Transport` (`MmioTransport`); `drivers/bus/virtio` adds only the
concrete PCI `Transport` implementation (and the register-window
backends) on top of it. The MMIO transport sits in `lib/virtio` so an
arch-neutral user-space virtio driver process can build it without a
`drivers/* → drivers/*` edge (`AGENTS.md` §17.4 / §2.2 — the `lib/usb`
↔ `drivers/bus/usb` precedent). Both wire
formats are implemented as parallel siblings (`AGENTS.md` §2.2): the
**split virtqueue** (virtio 1.1 §2.6, `SplitQueue`) and the **packed
virtqueue** (virtio 1.1 §2.7, `PackedQueue`). The device
drivers `drivers/storage/virtio_blk` and `drivers/network/virtio_net`
depend on `lib/virtio` and never on the bus driver crate — a driver
may depend on `lib/*` but not on another driver (`AGENTS.md` §17.4).
Per `AGENTS.md` §2.2 the queue protocol lives once, in `lib/virtio`,
and the device drivers carry only the device-specific wire format.

## Scope

`lib/virtio` (the protocol) covers:

- A `Transport` trait abstracting the PCI (`x86_64`) and MMIO
  (`aarch64`, `riscv64 virt`) bus seams behind a single interface.
  Its two concrete implementations are the modern-PCI `PciTransport`
  in `drivers/bus/virtio`
  (see [Modern PCI transport](#modern-pci-transport-pcitransport))
  and the virtio-MMIO `MmioTransport` in `lib/virtio`
  (see [Modern MMIO transport](#modern-mmio-transport-mmiotransport)).
- Virtio 1.1 §3.1 device-initialisation status sequencing
  (`reset` → `ACKNOWLEDGE` → `DRIVER` → `FEATURES_OK` → `DRIVER_OK`), and the
  one set of transport features every driver accepts wherever offered
  (`TRANSPORT_FEATURES`: `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1`, and `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM`,
  without which a device behind a
  [translation unit](../security/iommu.md) would be asked to bypass it). An
  address a driver programs is a device address (`DmaSlab::device_addr`,
  `ChainSegment::device_addr`), an IOVA on a translated node, never assumed
  physical.
  `Transport::reset` confirms the reset by re-reading the status until it
  reads 0, bounded, and fails with `DeviceFault` otherwise: a device that has
  not reset may still master memory it was given. Each driver declares its
  device quiesced (`DmaHost::device_quiesced`) only after a confirmed reset
  and carves everything fallible before `DRIVER_OK`. Every device type resets
  its device when it is dropped — whatever drops it, a serve loop's early
  return included — and one whose reset does not confirm withholds its rings
  and staging (`DmaSlab::withhold`) for the kernel's DMA quarantine rather
  than freeing them. Once virtio-net's reset confirms, its whole receive
  staging is zeroed before it is freed: a frame no `service` delivered has no
  ring class to say whether it was sensitive.
- The virtio 1.1 §2.6 **split virtqueue** (`SplitQueue`): descriptor
  table, avail ring, used ring, free-descriptor pool, descriptor
  chaining. The free list and every chain's links live in driver memory and
  the device-visible table is written from them, never read back, and a
  completion is accepted only for the head of a chain the device holds, so a
  device writing over the table, or naming a head it was never given or a
  chain's interior, can neither corrupt the free list nor have a completion
  attributed to the wrong chain. Descriptors are reissued oldest-returned
  first, so a completion the device repeats for a chain it already returned
  names free descriptors, and is refused, for as long as the ring allows.
  A returned chain's table entries are left as they were: nothing reads them
  back and a reissue rewrites every field. `SplitQueue::new` (and
  `PackedQueue::new`, which shares its sizing) takes the most descriptors the
  driver keeps on the queue at once and refuses a device whose queue cannot
  hold them with `VirtioError::QueueTooShallow`, before any ring is carved or
  handed to the device, rather than capping the queue silently and failing a
  request once the driver has begun it.
- **One request at a time** (`RequestQueue`), over a split queue: the one
  submit-and-wait the request/response drivers (virtio-blk, virtio-crypto, the
  virtio-sound and virtio-net control queues) share. A request waits at most
  its budget in all — each wait after a wake is given what is left of it,
  measured on the host's clock (`VirtioHost::now_ns`), so a device that keeps
  waking the driver cannot stretch it — and a storm of wakes ends sooner at
  `MAX_COMPLETION_WAKES`. A wait that times out, or could not be made at all
  (a host answers a revoked or refused interrupt binding with an immediate
  `TimedOut`), ends the request `DeviceOffline` once the ring has been read
  again, so a completion whose interrupt was lost is still taken. With
  nothing out, a completion in the ring answers nothing, so a request is
  refused rather than published over it. A request the device leaves
  unanswered fails to its caller, but its chain and every buffer it names
  stay the device's: `settle` retires the chain once the device hands it
  back, notifying the device again meanwhile at most once per the request's
  budget however often it is called, and until then nothing is published, so
  a late completion is never taken for a later request's and no request
  stages over memory the device may still read or write. Every driver stages
  a status no device writes into each reply before the request, so a
  completion that wrote none is refused rather than read as the last
  request's, and a payload the device writes into reused staging — a
  virtio-blk read, a virtio-crypto job's output — is handed back only when
  the completion's reported length covers it and the status behind it. A
  sensitive payload the device held is scrubbed when it comes back, or when
  a confirmed reset takes it back as the driver is dropped, rather than while
  the device may still be reading it, and a virtio-crypto session an
  abandoned or refused create, job or destroy left is destroyed again before
  the next job runs. `scrub` is the one zeroing every driver's staging gets.
- **Drains are bounded.** A pass over a used ring the driver drains in bulk
  takes at most a ring's worth of completions, however far the device claims
  to have got or however fast it refills what is reposted, and leaves the
  rest for the next call: virtio-net per `service` from each queue (a
  receive pass also finishing a merged frame begun inside the bound), and
  the virtio-sound and virtio-input event queues per drain. An event slot is
  zeroed before it is reposted, so a completion that wrote nothing is never
  read as the slot's last event.
- The virtio 1.1 §2.7 **packed virtqueue** (`PackedQueue`): a single
  descriptor ring plus the driver- and device-event-suppression
  structures, with availability and completion signalled in-band
  through each descriptor's `AVAIL`/`USED` flag bits against the
  per-side wrap counters (see [Packed virtqueue](#packed-virtqueue)).
  Both queues share the `ChainSegment` / `UsedToken` vocabulary and
  the same `Transport` seam.
- A `VirtioHost` trait through which a driver requests DMA-backed
  bounce buffers (`alloc_dma_zeroed`), parks pending completion
  (`notify_wait`), and reads the clock those waits run on (`now_ns`).
  `alloc_dma_zeroed` returns an **owned**
  [`DmaSlab`](#dma-ownership-model) so a driver can hold several
  simultaneously-live regions (e.g. the descriptor table + avail
  ring + used ring inside `SplitQueue`) without re-borrowing the
  host on every accessor.
- A `BounceBuffer` wrapper that honours
  [`BufferClass::Sensitive`](../abi/driver_traits.md) by zeroing its
  staging on drop (`AGENTS.md` §4).
- A `MockTransport` + `ChainView` test seam every virtio driver's host
  tests run on, built only with `lib/virtio`'s `mock` feature: consumers
  enable it in `[dev-dependencies]` alone, so no production build compiles
  it.

```

The kernel-side `VirtioHost` (`KernelVirtioHost`) and its per-driver
factory live one layer up, in `kernel/virtio`, because they link
`kernel/{mem,sec,irq}`; a driver crate may not (`AGENTS.md` §17.4).
They consume the same `lib/virtio` protocol the drivers do.

## Modern PCI transport (`PciTransport`)

`PciTransport` (`drivers/bus/virtio/src/transport_pci.rs`) is the
concrete `Transport` for a modern (virtio-1.x) PCI device. It owns
the four capability-checked `RegisterWindow`s the bus driver resolves
from the device's virtio PCI capabilities (virtio 1.1 §4.1.4) —
*common configuration*, *notification*, *ISR status*, and
*device-specific configuration* — plus the notification
capability's `notify_off_multiplier`. These are bundled in
`PciTransportWindows`, the transport-construction seam, which lives in
`lib/virtio` (not the bus driver) so the ring-0 provisioning walk in
`kernel/virtio` can assemble it and hand it to `PciTransport::new`
without naming the `drivers/bus/virtio` crate (`AGENTS.md` §17.4):

```rust
pub struct PciTransportWindows {
    pub common: RegisterWindow,
    pub notify: RegisterWindow,
    pub isr: RegisterWindow,
    pub device: RegisterWindow,
    pub notify_off_multiplier: u32,
}
```

Because a window can only be minted by the kernel MMIO-map facility
after a `CAP_MMIO_MAP` check, the transport holds **no** ambient
authority and performs **no** pointer arithmetic: every register
access goes through the bounds-checked `RegisterWindow` accessors
(`AGENTS.md` §4). The 64-bit queue-address registers (`queue_desc`,
`queue_driver`, `queue_device`) are written as two little-endian
`u32` halves, low half first, because virtio defines its 64-bit
registers as two 32-bit accesses (virtio 1.1 §4.1.3.1, §4.2.2) — which
is why the window carries no `u64` accessor. Both transports share the
one `write_u64_halves` in `lib/virtio`'s `transport` module rather than
each carrying its own copy of the split.

`PciTransport::new` validates that the common-configuration window
is at least `virtio_pci_common_cfg` length (`0x38` bytes) and reads
`num_queues` up front. Every common-cfg offset the infallible
`Transport` methods touch is a compile-time constant below that
bound, so those methods treat their accesses as in-bounds and fall
back to a safe default on the (then impossible) error rather than
panicking (`AGENTS.md` §2.9). The device-supplied notify offset is
bounds-checked against the notification window on the fallible
`queue_set` path, so the infallible `notify` only ever writes within
a pre-validated offset and fails closed (skips the write) for an
unprogrammed queue.

The transport is built signalling one way, fixed for its life: through
the MSI-X table entry the kernel routed, which `queue_set` programs into
every queue's `queue_msix_vector`, or, with no entry, on the function's
INTx pin, which the device holds until `ack_interrupt` reads the ISR
status (virtio 1.1 §4.1.4.5). A user-space driver builds it with
`PciTransport::map`, from the windows and the entry its grants name
(`virtio_pci_windows`), so the entry comes from the kernel that routed
it, never from a constant the driver assumes.

## Modern MMIO transport (`MmioTransport`)

`MmioTransport` (`lib/virtio/src/transport_mmio.rs`) is the
concrete `Transport` for a modern (virtio-1.x) MMIO device — the
layout QEMU's `-M virt` `virtio-mmio` transport and the RISC-V /
`AArch64` device-tree nodes advertise (virtio 1.1 §4.2). It lives in
`lib/virtio` (not the bus driver) because it depends only on the
bounds-checked `RegisterWindow` and the protocol types, so both the
kernel-side consumers and an arch-neutral user-space virtio driver
process can construct it without a `drivers/* → drivers/*` edge
(`AGENTS.md` §17.4 / §2.2 — the `lib/usb` ↔ `drivers/bus/usb`
precedent). Unlike the four capability-selected PCI windows, a
virtio-MMIO device exposes a **single** contiguous register block, so
the transport owns one `RegisterWindow`. A consumer resolves the
block's `(base, length)` from the boot device tree and maps it through
the same `CAP_MMIO_MAP`-gated MMIO-map facility; the transport
therefore holds **no** ambient authority and performs **no** pointer
arithmetic (`AGENTS.md` §4).

`MmioTransport::new` validates the `MagicValue` (`"virt"`), a modern
`Version` of `2`, a non-zero `DeviceID`, and a window that spans the
whole register block (`regs::WINDOW_MIN_LEN`), so every register the
infallible `Transport` methods touch is a compile-time constant
below that bound and never panics (`AGENTS.md` §2.9). Two MMIO-only
differences from the PCI transport:

- There is no "number of queues" register; a queue's existence is
  advertised through a non-zero `QueueNumMax`, so `num_queues`
  reports the architectural 16-bit maximum and the driver probes
  per-queue via `queue_select` + `queue_max_size`.
- Notification is a single write of the queue index to the
  `QueueNotify` register — there is no per-queue notify offset or
  multiplier — so `notify` is a constant-offset write that always
  stays in bounds.

The 64-bit queue-address registers (`QueueDesc`, `QueueDriver`,
`QueueDevice`) are written as `Low`/`High` `u32` pairs, and
`QueueReady` is set to `1` to bring a programmed queue online.

## Virtqueue memory ordering

`SplitQueue` issues the virtio 1.1 §2.7.13.3 ordering barriers around the
shared driver/device ring memory, so the device always observes a
consistent ring snapshot:

- **Publish** (`add_chain`): a `fence(Release)` separates the
  descriptor-table and avail-ring *entry* stores from the avail-`idx`
  store that exposes them, so a device that sees the new index cannot read
  a not-yet-written descriptor.
- **Notify** (`kick`): a `fence(SeqCst)` precedes the `QueueNotify` write,
  so the published avail-`idx` is globally visible before the device is
  notified.
- **Consume** (`poll_used`): a `fence(Acquire)` follows the used-`idx`
  read, so the used-ring *entry* read cannot be reordered ahead of the
  index that announced it.

These barriers are mandatory, not advisory. A **synchronous** backend
(virtio-blk, which QEMU drains on the same `notify` the guest issues, in
the issuing context) happens to tolerate their omission; an
**asynchronous** device does not. The motivating case is virtio-input: it
pops an eventq buffer when an input event arrives out of band, reading the
ring from a different context, so without the publish/notify barriers it
observes an empty avail ring and reports queue-full, and without the
consume barrier the driver reads a stale used-`idx` and never drains. The
barriers are also required on real hardware with weakly-ordered memory and
non-synchronous DMA. The `tests/integration/autoload_input_qemu_aarch64`
vertical is the regression guard (it never delivers a key without them).

## Packed virtqueue

`PackedQueue` (`lib/virtio/src/packed.rs`) implements the packed-ring
format (virtio 1.1 §2.7) as a parallel sibling of `SplitQueue`, not a
replacement: a device advertises it through the
`VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED` feature bit. Where the split format spreads
state across three structures, the packed format uses **one**
descriptor ring (`PackedQueue::desc_ring_size` bytes — 16 per entry)
plus two 4-byte event-suppression structures, programmed through the
*same* `Transport::queue_set(size, desc, driver_area, device_area)`
seam the split queue uses (the three address registers map to
`queue_desc` / `queue_driver` / `queue_device` either way, so no
transport-interface change was needed).

Availability and completion are signalled **in-band** in each
descriptor's `flags`:

- `VRING_PACKED_DESC_F_AVAIL (1 << 7)` and
  `VRING_PACKED_DESC_F_USED (1 << 15)` are interpreted relative to a
  single-bit wrap counter held independently by the driver
  (`avail_wrap`) and tracked for the device (`used_wrap`), both
  initialised to `1`.
- The driver marks a descriptor available by setting `AVAIL` to its
  wrap counter and `USED` to the inverse (`AVAIL != USED`). The
  device marks it used by setting both to its own wrap counter
  (`AVAIL == USED`). A wrap counter toggles each time its cursor
  steps off the last ring slot.

`add_chain` writes the chain across consecutive ring entries, sets
`VRING_PACKED_DESC_F_NEXT` on every entry but the last, stores the
buffer id in the last entry, and publishes the head descriptor's
flags last so the device never observes a partial scatter/gather
list (virtio 1.1 §2.7.6). It returns the buffer id (the chain's head
ring position); `poll_used` reads the in-band `USED` marker at its
cursor, reclaims the chain's slots, and returns a `UsedToken` —
the same `ChainSegment` / `UsedToken` vocabulary the split queue
uses. The in-process `MockTransport::drain_packed_queue` is the
packed peer the unit tests drive, mirroring `drain_queue` for the
split ring.

## DMA ownership model

`alloc_dma_zeroed` returns a `DmaSlab` — an owned handle of the
shape

```
struct DmaSlab {
    device_addr: u64,
    ptr: NonNull<u8>,
    len: usize,
    pool_id: PoolId,
    slot: usize,
    /* type-erased free shim */
}
```

The `device_addr` is what the driver hands its device: an IOVA behind a
translation unit, a physical address without one, never a CPU pointer.
`DmaSlab::device_addr_at(offset, len)` bounds a sub-range to the slab.

The slab carries the disjoint-slot invariant in its `pool_id` /
`slot` fields: every slab minted from the same pool carries a
distinct `slot` index, the pool's slot bitmap guarantees the byte
range `[ptr, ptr + len)` does not overlap any other live slab, and
`DmaSlab::as_bytes_mut` cites that bitmap as its `// SAFETY:`
witness. The owning shape means the consumer driver code can hold
three live slabs in `SplitQueue` (descriptor table + avail ring +
used ring) and three more in a transaction (header + payload +
status) without ever re-borrowing the pool.

The in-process `MockHost` mints slabs with `PoolId::MOCK`, a
monotonic `slot` counter, and a free shim that records the release
(`slabs_outstanding`) and whether the slab came back zeroed
(`released_zeroed`). It owns the memory it mints and frees it once it,
and every device reaching it, is dropped — so, as a production pool must,
it outlives every slab — and a withheld slab is still the host's to free.
A `MockTransport` reaches that memory once `reach`ed or attached, and only
by device address: each address resolves through the slab's own pointer,
keeping the provenance strict-provenance miri checks, and an extent
running past its slab is a `DeviceFault`, as a device confined by a
translation unit finds nothing there. It is the one test host every virtio
driver's tests run on: each wait plays a scripted `MockWait` (the device
answers, a wake with nothing done, silence for the whole budget, a wait
refused at once, or a completion whose interrupt is lost) and advances the
host's clock by what that wait would have taken, and an attached shared
`MockTransport` (`MockTransport::into_shared`) is drained on the waited
queue, as a device completing on its interrupt would.

### Kernel host (`KernelVirtioHost`)

Stage 4.D Item 0 ships the real, capability-checked
`VirtioHost` implementation. It lives in
`kernel/virtio/src/kernel_host.rs` — the kernel crate, because it
links `kernel/{mem,sec,irq}`, which a driver crate may not
(`AGENTS.md` §17.4) — and is generic over the page-table backend `P`
and the audit `Sink` `S`:

```rust
pub struct KernelVirtioHost<'a, P: PageTable, S: Sink + ?Sized> {
    /* RefCell<DmaPool<'a, P>>, &'a TaskCapabilities, &'a S,
       fresh PoolId, monotonic slot counter, live-slot table,
       &'a IrqTable, IrqHandle, &'a dyn IrqWaiter */
}
```

The host **owns** its `DmaPool` (the `'a` lifetime bounds only the
pool's `FrameAllocator` borrow, not the pool itself), so the floor
bring-up that mints one hands it out whole.

`alloc_dma_zeroed` routes every request through
`kernel/sec::dma::alloc_dma`, which performs the
`CapabilityId::MEM_DMA` check and emits the
`AuditEvent::DmaAllocated` (or `…Denied`) record. The host then
calls `DmaPool::slot_base(&buf)` and mints a `DmaSlab` via
`DmaSlab::from_pool`, stamping its own fresh `PoolId` and a
monotonic slot index. The slab carries a free shim
(`unsafe fn(*const(), usize, usize)`) that re-enters the host on
drop, looks the buffer up by slot, and routes it back through
`kernel/sec::dma::free_dma`. The shim is monomorphised per
`(P, S)` so the `*const ()` cast back to
`*const KernelVirtioHost<'_, P, S>` is the inverse of the one
performed at construction (`AGENTS.md` §2.10 — every `unsafe`
block carries its `// SAFETY:` justification).

`notify_wait` blocks the loaded driver task on the device's
pre-bound interrupt line through `kernel/irq::block_until_ready`
(Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.3); the host borrows the kernel `IrqTable`,
the bus-driver-minted `IrqHandle`, and the scheduler/clock
`IrqWaiter` seam for this.

The wait is bounded by the **caller's** `timeout_ns` and answers
`CompletionSignal::Fired` or `CompletionSignal::TimedOut`. A driver with a
request outstanding passes its device class's per-request deadline
(`BlkDeviceClass::budget().deadline_ns`); a driver waiting for an unsolicited
event with nothing pending (an idle input device) passes `u64::MAX`. A request
wait must never be unbounded: the waiting task holds the device's lock for the
duration of its request, so one lost or coalesced completion interrupt would
park it forever and stall every other user of that disk behind it — silently,
with no error to explain it. A request whose wait times out — or whose wait
the host could not make, which every non-fire outcome of the IRQ park
reports as `TimedOut` at once — therefore fails closed with
`DriverError::DeviceOffline` after one final used-ring re-scan (a completion
whose interrupt was lost is already in the ring), and is not reissued in
place: the device may still own the published descriptor chain, so
re-publishing the same staging could have an abandoned request complete into
the next one's buffers. Reissue policy belongs to the consumer above, which
knows whether the request is safe to repeat.

A refusal reaches the driver through `DmaGateError::as_driver_error`, the
one mapping every in-kernel host shares: a missing capability is
`DriverError::PermissionDenied`, exhausted memory `OutOfMemory`, a carve too
large to make `LengthOutOfRange`, and a pool fault `OutOfRange`. `MockHost`
answers its 64 MiB cap as exhaustion too, so a driver sees one shape
whichever host minted its memory.

## Capability model

- `register` requires `CAP_DRV_LOAD` (load-time).
- The transport crate is loaded as a user-space driver; it never
  asserts `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`.
- Per-method capabilities for block / net are documented on the
  `Block` / `Net` traits in [Driver traits](../abi/driver_traits.md).

## Untrusted device input

The used ring and the descriptor table are **device-written**: a buggy or
hostile device (a DMA-capable, Thunderclap-class peer, CWE-1257) may write
a completion naming anything, or DMA-scribble the descriptor table.
`SplitQueue::poll_used` accepts a completion only for the head of a chain
the device holds, read from the driver's own records: anything else is
refused with `VirtioError::MalformedCompletion` (mapped to
`DriverError::DeviceFault`) and reclaims nothing, and the reclaim walk
follows the driver's private chain links, never the table the device can
write. The driver never dereferences a descriptor outside the granted
region — it fails closed rather than trusting the device. The mock peer
holds itself to the same rule: it checks every descriptor index against the
table before reading it and bounds a chain by the table's length, so a
scribbled `next` link or a loop is refused rather than followed. A used
entry's written length is untrusted too: nothing past it is read as data
(virtio 1.1 §2.6.8.2).

## Test surface

The protocol and the kernel host are tested in the crates that own
them (`AGENTS.md` §7 — unit tests next to the code):

- `cargo test -p tairix-virtio` covers the bus-agnostic protocol:
  split-queue free-list initialisation, descriptor chaining (single
  + multi), exhaustion, used-ring wrap-around, status progression,
  mock-peer round-trip, sensitive-class scrub on drop, and the
  `DmaSlab` ownership tests (round-trip; three simultaneous disjoint
  writes; `drop` invokes the free shim once with the right
  `(slot, len)`; `pool_id` distinguishes slabs across pools). The
  packed ring (virtio 1.1 §2.7) is covered alongside the split ring:
  the `AVAIL`/`USED` flag truth table and descriptor byte round-trip,
  plus end-to-end queue initialisation, non-power-of-two rejection,
  slot consumption, mock-peer round-trip, empty/too-long and
  free-pool-exhaustion rejection, ring-wrap-with-reclaim across the
  ring boundary (toggling both wrap counters), and the empty
  no-completion / no-op-drain paths. The adversarial tests
  (`poll_used_rejects_a_device_head_outside_the_descriptor_table`,
  `a_completion_for_anything_but_a_chain_the_device_holds_is_refused`,
  `a_device_writing_over_the_descriptor_table_cannot_corrupt_the_free_list`,
  `a_returned_chains_descriptors_are_reissued_last`,
  `the_peer_refuses_a_chain_that_leaves_the_table_or_loops`) and the
  `fuzz_virtqueue` harness drive a hostile device-written used ring /
  descriptor table and assert the consumer fails closed, attributes every
  completion exactly, and never hands out a descriptor a held chain owns.
  It also
  covers the concrete virtio-MMIO transport (`transport_mmio`), which
  lives here for the riscv64 / `AArch64` MMIO bus seam: short-window,
  bad-magic, legacy-version and empty-slot rejection, status
  write/read + reset, device/driver-feature halves, queue-select
  register write, queue programming + `QueueReady`, oversize
  rejection, single-register notify, device-config read with zero-fill
  overflow, and a `SplitQueue`-drives-`MmioTransport` integration
  check.
- `cargo test -p tairix-drv-bus-virtio` covers the concrete PCI
  transport: the `transport_pci` tests (short-window rejection,
  `num_queues` read, status write/read + reset, driver-feature
  halves, queue-select range check, queue programming + notify-offset
  recording, oversize and out-of-bounds-notify rejection, no-op
  notify for an unprogrammed queue, device-config read with zero-fill
  overflow, and a `SplitQueue`-drives-`PciTransport` integration
  check).
- `cargo test -p tairix-kernel-virtio` covers the kernel host and
  MMIO mapper: zero-initialisation + audit emit, drop routes through
  `free_dma`, `CapabilityId::MEM_DMA` refusal returns
