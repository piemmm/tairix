# Hardware interrupts: capability-gated user-space wake-ups

This page documents the `abi-v1` user/kernel contract for delivering
hardware interrupts to user-space drivers. The contract is exercised
by the `irq_bind` / `irq_wait` syscall pair and gated by the
`CAP_IRQ_BIND` capability (`lib/abi/src/capability.rs`).

Wake-up plumbing on the kernel side — the per-line wait queue and the
controller-level mask / unmask sequence — is wired and
QEMU-validated (see *Kernel-side implementation* below). The first
in-kernel consumer of the wait loop, `KernelVirtioHost::notify_wait`,
blocks a loaded virtio driver on its device's pre-bound `IrqHandle`
through the same shared primitive (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.3). This
page locks down the contract those pieces respect.

## ABI surface

| `SyscallNumber` | name       | args                              | ret           | required capability |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 8               | `irq_bind` | `line: u32`                       | `IrqHandle`   | `CAP_IRQ_BIND`      |
| 9               | `irq_wait` | `handle: IrqHandle, timeout_ns: u64` | `Result<(), Errno>` | `CAP_IRQ_BIND` |

* `line` is the architecture-defined IRQ identifier:
  * **x86_64** — Global System Interrupt (GSI) reported by ACPI MADT
    (`kernel/arch/x86_64::acpi::Madt`).
  * **AArch64** — GIC `IntId` (SGI / PPI / SPI namespace per the
    GICv3 architecture reference).
  * **riscv64** — PLIC source number reported by the device tree's
    `interrupts-extended` property.
  * **wasm32** — reserved; the WASM host has no concept of hardware
    interrupts. A call from a WASM userland returns
    `Errno::NotImplemented`.
* `IrqHandle` is the opaque `u64` newtype in
  [`lib/abi/src/syscall.rs`](../../../lib/abi/src/syscall.rs). The
  kernel reserves `IrqHandle::INVALID` (`0`) so a caller-zeroed
  argument cannot be mistaken for a live handle.
* `timeout_ns` is interpreted relative to the kernel monotonic clock
  (`clock_get`'s reference). The kernel must round up to its tick
  granularity, never down — a caller asking for a 1 ns wait must not
  receive a zero-duration wait.

## Capability check

`CAP_IRQ_BIND = 11` is the single gate on both syscalls. The
dispatcher refuses with `Errno::PermissionDenied` and emits one
`SyscallPermissionDenied` audit record before any state is touched
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4 step 2). There is no "open by default" path; a task
holding no capabilities cannot observe a hardware interrupt under any
circumstances.

`CAP_IRQ_BIND` says a task may bind lines at all, never which: `irq_bind`
binds a line only while one of the caller's live grants names it — a line
its node requested, or a vector `msi_alloc` allocated for its device — and
refuses any other with `PermissionDenied`. When the node leaves the tree the
grant is revoked and the binding released, so a parked `irq_wait` returns
`NotFound`, a wait set holding the handle fails `NotFound`, and the line
cannot be bound again under the dead grant.

The same capability gates both ends deliberately: a task that may
bind a line must be able to wait on it, and the implementation of
`irq_wait` re-checks that `handle` was minted for the calling task
before any state transition, so a forged handle from another task is
rejected with `Errno::NotFound`. Splitting the gate into separate
`CAP_IRQ_BIND` / `CAP_IRQ_WAIT` would add ABI surface without making
the policy any tighter — the binding step is the security-relevant
authority.

The dispatcher emits a `SyscallInvoked` audit record on every
successful `irq_bind` (the spec row sets `audit: true`); `irq_wait`
is **not** audited on success, otherwise a busy driver would drown
the audit log.

## Wake-up contract

A producer of an interrupt — the per-architecture trap dispatcher
that fields the line at the controller — performs the following
sequence in this order:

1. **Mask the line at the controller** (LAPIC EOI inhibit / GIC
   `ICACTIVE` / PLIC `claim`) **before** waking the user-space
   waiter. This is the *only* ordering that prevents the same edge
   from re-firing while the driver is still draining its completion
   queue, and it must happen on the same CPU that took the trap so
   the controller-side state is consistent.
2. **Mark the line ready** in the kernel-side IRQ table entry
   associated with `handle`.
3. **Wake at most one** waiter on the per-handle wait queue. The
   driver is expected to bind one task per line; the kernel must not
   broadcast.
4. The woken task observes `Ok(())` returned from `irq_wait`. After
   draining its queues the driver re-issues `irq_wait`, which clears
   the ready flag and re-arms the line at the controller.

If `timeout_ns` elapses before step 2 occurs the kernel resumes the
waiter with `Err(Errno::TimedOut)`. The handle stays bound and the
caller may immediately re-issue `irq_wait`; `TimedOut` is **not** an
error in the IRQ subsystem (`lib/abi/src/error.rs`).

## Failure modes

| `Errno`             | when                                                            | audit event                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `PermissionDenied`  | caller lacks `CAP_IRQ_BIND`                                     | `SyscallPermissionDenied`  |
| `PermissionDenied`  | `irq_bind` `line` is named by no live grant of the caller       | `SyscallHandlerRejected`   |
| `OutOfRange`        | `line` exceeds the platform's allowable range                   | `SyscallBadArguments`      |
| `OutOfRange`        | `irq_bind` `line` argument carries non-zero upper 32 bits       | `SyscallBadArguments`      |
| `NotFound`          | `irq_wait` `handle` was not minted for the calling task, or was released when its device's node was removed | `SyscallHandlerRejected`   |
| `TimedOut`          | `irq_wait` timeout expired before the line fired                | none (per the audit policy)|
| `NotImplemented`    | called from a WASM userland or before the IRQ subsystem is wired up | none                     |

Every audit event listed above already exists in
`kernel/sec::audit`; the IRQ subsystem reuses them rather than minting
new event IDs.

## Why the kernel masks the line on wake-up

A user-space driver cannot reliably mask its own line: the
controller-level register write is privileged on every Tier-1
architecture (LAPIC MSR, GIC system register, PLIC MMIO behind a
kernel-only page mapping). If the kernel left the line unmasked on
wake-up, an edge-triggered device that fires faster than the driver
can drain its completion queue would re-enter the trap path and
either spin the CPU (level-triggered) or back-pressure the controller
into dropping subsequent edges (edge-triggered). The kernel therefore
masks the line *before* it wakes the waiter and unmasks it on the
driver's next `irq_wait` call, which is the moment the driver tells
the kernel "I am ready for the next edge". This sequencing is the
load-bearing safety invariant of the entire user-space IRQ path; the
follow-up session's kernel-side test plan exercises it directly.

## Runaway-line quarantine (safety net)

Mask-before-wake stops a single edge from re-entering the trap path while
the driver drains, but it does not by itself stop a line that *keeps*
re-asserting every time the kernel re-arms it: a wedged or never-quiesced
controller (a USB host controller whose interrupt condition the driver's
acknowledge did not clear), or a hostile device, can drive the
mask → wake → drain → re-arm → re-assert cycle indefinitely and peg the CPU
that services it — the observed "mouse driver / xhci pegged at 100% CPU"
symptom, and a hard-lockup trigger when it coincides with an in-kernel park.

The kernel therefore rate-limits each line. Under mask-before-wake a bound
line can only re-fire *after* its user-space driver drains the completion
and the kernel re-arms it, so every legitimate interrupt costs a full
user-space round-trip (syscall → driver work → syscall). No real device
driven that way sustains anywhere near 100 000 interrupts per second on one
line; a line that does is re-asserting with no work being done.
`IrqTable::fire` counts each line's fires over a one-second sliding window
(using a boot-installed monotonic clock, read lock-free from interrupt
context) and, on exceeding `STORM_FIRE_BUDGET` (100 000) fires in a window,
**quarantines** the line:

* the line is kept masked (it stays contained) and **no further wake is
  delivered** — `fire` stops setting `ready`;
* the parked waiter observes `WaitStep::Quarantined` and its `irq_wait` /
  `waitset_wait` syscall **fails closed** with `Errno::DeviceFault` (the
  device is unhealthy), rather than re-arming into another storm;
* the disable is recorded once on the audit log as `IRQ_LINE_QUARANTINED`
  (id 4090), emitted at the syscall boundary (task context, so `fire` stays
  lock-free), naming the `line` and owning `task`;
* a fresh `irq_bind` clears the quarantine, so a driver that recovers its
  device can rebind the line.

This is the kernel's analogue of Linux's `note_interrupt` spurious-IRQ
disable, adapted to the user-space IRQ model. The budget is deliberately
generous so a busy-but-healthy line (serviced with real work each round,
whose fires spread across windows) never trips; only a genuine runaway does.
Until the monotonic clock is installed at boot the accounting is inert (no
line is ever quarantined), so early-boot interrupts behave exactly as
before — fail-open on the *net*, never on security (the line is still masked
and delivered normally).

## Observability (the IRQ table through the System Information API)

The bound IRQ table is readable, like every other piece of live system
state, only through the System Information API — never a `/proc`-style
file (`AGENTS.md` §16.6). The `IRQ_LIST` query returns one `IrqRecord`
per bound line — the line id, the kernel-attested owning driver task,
the monotonic interrupt count since boot (the classic
`/proc/interrupts` per-line total), and the `IRQ_FLAG_QUARANTINED`
flag — paged by an `IrqListRequest`. It is gated on `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`
and audited, exactly like the hardware tree and seat inventory: it
names which task owns each physical interrupt line, cross-principal
surface topology, not a self-scoped observer. The count already exists
(the quarantine rate-accounting above increments it on every edge), so
serving it adds no steady-state cost.

The one record is served by `sysinfod` and read through the shared
`tairix_procinfo` walk (`for_each_irq`), so every consumer sees the same
definition and none re-implements it:

* `sysinfo irq` (equivalently `irqs`) prints the table, one aligned row
  per line;
* the resource-reference resolver answers `info:irq/<line>/owner` (the
  owning task), `state:irq/<line>/quarantined` (yes/no), and
  `stats:irq/count` (the aggregate since-boot total) or
  `stats:irq/<line>/count` (one line's total) — each gated on
  `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`, fail-closed on an unbound line id;
* the `sysmon` monitor's interrupt-lines panel shows the live table
  alongside its memory and load panels.

The count is monotonic since boot (it is not reset when a line is
re-bound), and a quarantined line reports the same disable the
`IRQ_LINE_QUARANTINED` audit event (4090) and a lockup report's
`stuck_owner` attribution carry.

## Out of scope for this contract

* **IRQ raising / masking by user space.** Neither syscall grants the
  ability to assert or mask a line. Both remain kernel-only.
* **Sharing a line between drivers.** `abi-v1` mints at most one
  binding per `(task, line)` pair. Shared-IRQ devices (PCI legacy
  pin-based interrupts) are out of scope; the virtio family uses
  MSI/MSI-X or PCIe message-signalled interrupts, which assign one
  GSI per queue and do not share.
* **Re-binding after task exit.** `Scheduler::exit` releases every
  binding the exiting task held; the kernel unmasks no lines on
  task exit (a freshly created task that wants the same line must
  re-issue `irq_bind`).

## Kernel-side implementation (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail)

The kernel-side substrate that backs the contract above lives in
the `kernel/irq` crate (`tairix-kernel-irq`). The crate is `no_std`,
holds no global mutable state, and exposes one type, `IrqTable`,
together with an `IrqController` seam the architecture port
implements:

```

### Invariants

1. **Mask-before-wake.** `IrqTable::fire(line, controller)` calls
   `controller.mask(line)` *before* it sets the per-entry `ready`
   flag. The Rust source orders the two operations in that
   sequence; the unit test
   `kernel/irq::table::tests::mask_is_observed_before_wake`
   installs a probe controller whose `mask` impl reads the table's
   own `ready` flag through a borrow and asserts it is still
   `false` while `mask` is in flight. A regression that reorders
   the writes fails the test deterministically.
2. **Forgery defence in the table.** `IrqTable::try_wait_step`
   re-verifies the `(handle, caller)` mapping before any state
   transition. The syscall handler does not need to re-check,
   and the dispatcher does not see forged handles — the
   distinction surfaces only through the standard
   `SYSCALL_HANDLER_REJECTED` audit record carrying the syscall
   name.
3. **Lock ordering.** The table's interior `RwLock<Inner>` mirrors
   the `CapTable` lock-ordering policy: the syscall handler
   acquires the IRQ-table write lock for the duration of one
   `bind` / `try_wait_step` / `release_for` call and never holds
   the capability-table lock at the same time. The dispatcher
   releases the cap-table read lock before invoking the handler
   body, so a concurrent `cap_revoke` cannot deadlock against an
   in-flight `irq_wait`.
4. **Idempotent release.** `IrqTable::release_for(task)` returns
   the number of bindings it dropped; a second call against the
   same task returns zero. The `exit` syscall handler invokes
   `release_for` unconditionally before evicting the capability
   record, so a task that holds no IRQ bindings still terminates
   cleanly.
5. **Observation-only dispatch hook.** `IrqTable::fire` notifies a
   set-once `IrqDispatchObserver` at its entry (read through a
   lock-free `OnceCell`, so the interrupt-context path never blocks).
   The kernel installs one observer that feeds interrupt-arrival
   timing into the entropy pool (`lib/rng`); it is purely passive and
   ordered *before* `controller.mask`, so it can neither reorder nor
   suppress the mask-before-wake sequence and cannot weaken this
   contract. It is fed on every fire, including strays on unbound
   lines.

### Wait semantics

The polling loop on top of `IrqTable::try_wait_step` lives in one
place — `tairix_kernel_irq::block_until_ready` — so every in-kernel
waiter drives the same implementation rather than re-deriving it
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2 — no duplication). The loop computes the deadline
once (`start + saturating(timeout)`, so `u64::MAX` does not wrap to a
tiny value), polls `try_wait_step`, and suspends between polls until
the line fires, the deadline elapses, or the binding disappears.

The clock and the suspend step are inverted behind the
two-method `IrqWaiter` trait, which keeps `kernel/irq` free of any
scheduler or architecture dependency:

* `IrqWaiter::now_ns()` — non-decreasing per-CPU clock reading.
* `IrqWaiter::yield_now()` — suspends until the next poll (a real park
  off the run queue on the syscall path, a cooperative yield / `wfi`
  on the kthread path — the implementation's choice) and returns `Ok`
  to re-loop, or `Err(IrqWaitAbort)` to abort (e.g. the task can no
  longer be scheduled).

Three implementations exist:

* **`irq_wait` syscall handler** (`kernel/core::syscalls`): registers
  the caller on `tairix_kernel_core::IRQ_WAITQ` *before* the first
  poll, then **parks** off the run queue (`SyscallIrqWaiter` calls
  `reschedule_current(Park)` — `AGENTS.md` §2.1, no busy yield). The
  device-IRQ dispatch path's `irq_wake` (after `IrqTable::fire`) and the
  architecture one-shot's `timed_wake_sweep` are **lock-free**: they only
  flag a pending wake on `IRQ_WAITQ`, and the actual `unpark` runs at the
  next dispatcher-context `waitq::drain_pending_wakes` (the fully preemptive
  kernel runs in-kernel code with device IRQs enabled, so an ISR must never
  take the scheduler lock — `AGENTS.md` §17.1). The waiter re-checks its own
  bound line after every wake and deregisters when the wait ends. The
  register-before-poll order plus the scheduler wake-pending token
  closes the park/unpark race, exactly as `hw_tree_wait` does
  (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). A caller with no published resume handle is not a
  resumable user task: `reschedule_current` returns `false` and the wait
  fails closed with `Errno::NotImplemented`, the same answer the futex
  wait gives the same condition. It must not fall back to re-enqueueing
  the caller without suspending it — that clears the caller's per-CPU
  current-task slot without suspending anything, leaving the task
  running as a caller the next syscall cannot attribute.
* **`KthreadIrqWaiter`** (`kernel/core::kthread_irq`): the waiter an
  in-kernel **service kthread** drives — it has no syscall frame or
  `Scheduler` borrow, so it suspends through the object-safe
  `YieldHandle` the core hands its body. It wraps that handle (in a
  `RefCell`, because `IrqWaiter::yield_now` is `&self` while
  `YieldHandle::yield_now` is `&mut self`) plus a monotonic-clock
  closure, and like the syscall path it *yields* (re-enqueues,
  staying runnable, or `wfi`-parks on metal) rather than parking on the
  scheduler run queue, so there is no lost-wakeup window. This is the
  path the P11 root-unlock kthread takes to drive
  interrupt-driven block I/O before login; it is proven end-to-end by
  the `tests/integration/irq_kthread_qemu_aarch64` vertical, where a
  device SPI wakes a parked kthread under the live scheduler.
* **`KernelVirtioHost::notify_wait`** (`kernel/virtio`): waits on
  the device's pre-bound
  `IrqHandle` against the owning task (`caller.task()`) with the
  **caller's** timeout, and answers `CompletionSignal::Fired` or
  `CompletionSignal::TimedOut`. A virtio device signals completion
  on a single MSI / MMIO line, not per-queue, so the wait key is the
  handle, not `queue_index`; the driver re-scans every used ring on
  wake-up. Because the wake-up is the ready flag that `fire` sets
  *after* masking, the mask-before-wake invariant is observed before
  the driver returns from `notify_wait` — exercised by
  `kernel_host::tests::notify_wait_observes_mask_before_wake`.

  A driver with a **request outstanding** passes that device's
  per-request deadline (`BlkDeviceClass::budget().deadline_ns` for a
  block device); only a driver waiting for an **unsolicited event**
  with nothing pending — an idle keyboard — passes `u64::MAX`. The
  distinction is load-bearing: the waiting task holds the device's
  lock for the duration of its request, so a request wait that could
  not expire turns one lost or coalesced completion interrupt into a
  task parked forever, and every other user of that hardware stalls
  behind it with no error to explain why. That is exactly how a
  `/System` mount once wedged a whole boot. Every non-`Ready`
  outcome — deadline elapsed, binding released, line quarantined,
  wait aborted — is reported as `TimedOut`, because a driver cannot
  tell them apart from a dead device and none of them is a reason to
  wait again; the driver fails the transfer closed
  (`DriverError::DeviceOffline`) instead. Covered by
  `kernel_host::tests::a_silent_device_times_out_instead_of_waiting_forever`
  and `the_callers_budget_reaches_the_park`.

  The deadline reaches the park because `block_until_ready` hands it
  to every `IrqWaiter::yield_now` call, so `IrqParkWaiter` registers
  it on `IRQ_WAITQ` and the timed sweep can release a park whose line
  never fires at all. A park that is not told the deadline can only be
  woken by the line, which is what made the wait unbounded in fact
  while it looked bounded in the caller.

This design composes existing scheduler primitives only; no new
scheduler interface is introduced (`AGENTS.md` §2.4 — no interface
creep). The `irq_wait` syscall path now **parks** off the run queue
rather than busy-yielding: the device-IRQ dispatch path's `irq_wake`
(after `IrqTable::fire`) unparks a waiter on a fire, and `IRQ_WAITQ`
is swept by `timed_wake_sweep` for finite timeouts, so a blocked
user-space driver consumes no scheduler quanta. The in-kernel kthread
path still suspends through its own race-free wait (a cooperative
yield under the QEMU verticals, a `wfi` park on metal); migrating it
to the same scheduler park is the device two-task split, queued for a
future landing alongside the per-arch trap glue.

### Architecture-port glue

Each architecture port supplies an `IrqController` impl. The
kernel/core default is `UnsupportedController`, whose `mask`
returns `MaskError::Unsupported`; the kernel binary is expected
to swap in a real controller during its post-`run_phases` wiring
phase:

| Architecture | Production controller                                                                                  | Status today |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `x86_64`     | `kernel/tairix-kernel::ioapic_controller::IoApicController` — IO-APIC redirection-entry mask via `IoApic::set_redirection_entry`; trap source from the `0x30..=0xFE` per-vector ISR thunks (`kernel/arch/x86_64/src/external_irq.s`) and Rust dispatcher (`kernel/arch/x86_64::irq`). | **Wired and QEMU-validated** (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.2 + QEMU validation). `BinArch::irq_routing` returns the controller; `try_boot` walks MADT's IO-APIC entries, installs one IDT vector per pin, and programs every redirection entry `masked = true`. The `tests/integration/irq_qemu_x86_64` integration crate drives a live PIT-channel-0 one-shot through GSI 2 and asserts both `WaitStep::Ready` and the post-fire mask bit. |
| `aarch64`    | `kernel/tairix-kernel::aarch64::gic_irq::GicIrqController` — the downstream `IrqController` bridge over the arch port's `kernel/arch/aarch64::gic::GicController`, whose HAL `mask` clears the distributor `ICENABLER` enable bit + SeqCst-fences; the EL1 IRQ vector (`kernel/arch/aarch64::exceptions`) acknowledges via `IAR`, forwards a non-timer INTID to the set-once `set_device_irq_dispatch` hook, and bridges to `IrqTable::fire`. | **Wired into the boot path and QEMU-validated** (P11 Chunk B-2 INCREMENT (1)). `Aarch64BinArch::irq_routing` returns the GICv2-backed routing and `install_irq_dispatch` publishes the `IrqTable` into the EL1 vector seam, so the kernel/core `irq` phase builds the table against the real controller. Device SPIs are discovered from the device tree (`kernel/arch/aarch64::fdt::gic_device_intid` decodes a node's `interrupts` triple → INTID, no board constant) and a parked **kthread** is woken through `KthreadIrqWaiter`; proven end-to-end by `tests/integration/irq_kthread_qemu_aarch64` (RTC SPI → parked kthread → `WaitOutcome::Ready` + post-fire masked bit) alongside the delivery-path vertical `tests/integration/irq_qemu_aarch64`. The boot path does not yet *bind/route* a device SPI — that arrives with INCREMENT (2)'s root-unlock kthread; the arch port owns no `kernel/irq` dependency — the bridge lives downstream (`AGENTS.md` §17.2). |
| `riscv64`    | `tests/integration/riscv64_boot::PlicIrqController` — the downstream `IrqController` bridge over the arch port's `kernel/arch/riscv64::plic::PlicController`, whose inherent `mask` writes the source's PLIC priority register to zero; S-mode trap vector (`kernel/arch/riscv64::trap`) claims/completes via the PLIC and bridges to `IrqTable::fire`. | **Implemented and host-tested**, not yet armed in the boot path (Stage 4.D Item 4 — riscv64 external-IRQ controller). The PLIC register driver, the `scause` decode, the one-shot dispatch slot, and the `PlicIrqController` bridge (incl. mask-before-wake through `IrqTable`) are unit-tested; the boot pipeline does not call `trap::init_traps` until the virtio-mmio verticals wire it. The arch port owns no `kernel/irq` dependency — the bridge lives downstream (`AGENTS.md` §17.2). |
| `wasm32`     | No hardware-interrupt concept                                                                          | Permanently `UnsupportedController` (per the contract above). |

There are two `IrqController` traits and they are deliberately
distinct. The one in this section is the **consumer-side**
`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqController` (just `mask`) that `IrqTable::fire`
calls during a wake. Separately, the §17.2 Arch HAL
(`tairix_arch_api`, `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W3) defines an
architecture-facing `IrqController` (`mask` + `unmask`, fail-closed with
`IrqControlError::OutOfRange`) and an `InterruptEntry` (the `claim` →
`complete` prologue/epilogue) so the architecture-neutral kernel can name
one controller surface across every port. Each port implements the HAL
traits over its real controller behind an MMIO seam — riscv64
`PlicController` (`PlicMmio`), aarch64 `GicController` (`GicMmio`,
`ICENABLER`/`ISENABLER` masking + `IAR`/`EOIR`), and x86_64
`IoApicController` (`IoApicMmio`) — and runs the host
`irq::conformance::run_controller` (+ `run_entry` for the claim-based
ports) vertical over it. x86_64 is **vectored** and implements
`IrqController` only (no claim register to model, so no `InterruptEntry`,
`AGENTS.md` §2.1). The downstream `kernel/irq` bridge each port's boot
pipeline installs forwards the consumer-side `mask` to the same
controller, so the arch port still owns no `kernel/irq` dependency
(`AGENTS.md` §17.2).

The kernel binary records one `KERNEL_PHASE_STARTED` /
`KERNEL_PHASE_READY` pair with `phase = "irq"` strictly between
the `sched` and `syscall` phase markers. The kernel/core init
order is therefore `log → mem → sec → sched → irq → syscall →
ipc`, pinned by
`kernel/core::init::Phase::ORDER` and the
`run_phases_emits_each_phase_in_documented_order` and
`irq_phase_lands_between_sched_and_syscall` regression tests.

### x86_64 trap glue (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.2)

The x86_64 trap path threads an external IRQ end-to-end through:

1. **IDT vectors `0x30..=0xFE`.** Reserved for external IRQs.
   Per-vector asm stubs are emitted by an `.altmacro` / `.rept`
   loop in `kernel/arch/x86_64/src/external_irq.s`; the stub
   addresses are published as a `.rodata` `.quad` table and
   exposed through `kernel/arch/x86_64::irq::external_isr_addr`.
2. **Shared trampoline.** Each per-vector stub pushes the vector
   immediate and jumps to `tairix_arch_x86_64_external_irq_common`,
   which saves the 15 GPRs into a `SavedRegs` block and calls
   `tairix_arch_x86_64_external_irq_dispatch(*mut SavedRegs, u64)`.
3. **Rust dispatcher.** Reads the installed `ExternalIrqDispatchFn`
   from a set-once `AtomicUsize` and writes the LAPIC EOI register
   before returning. The asm trampoline pops GPRs, drops the
   vector qword, and `iretq`s.
4. **Vector↔GSI routing.** A read-only-after-init `Routing` table
   (lock-free, one `AtomicU32` per reserved vector) maps the IDT
   vector to a GSI. Populated by the kernel binary's
   `try_boot::discover_and_program_io_apics` during the
   `Phase::Irq` step.
5. **IO-APIC programming.** The kernel binary walks every MADT
   `IoApic { id, address, gsi_base }` entry, allocates a vector
   per pin from the reserved range, calls
   `percpu::install_vector` to wire the IDT, calls
   `Routing::install(gsi, vector)`, and calls
   `IoApicController::program_pin(gsi, vector, bsp_lapic_id,
   masked = true)`. Lines start masked; a follow-up driver-host
   commit unmasks them when a userland driver binds.
6. **Mask-before-wake.** `IoApicController::mask` re-writes the
   IO-APIC redirection entry with the cached `(vector, dest)`
   and `masked = true`, then issues a `core::sync::atomic::fence`
   with `Ordering::SeqCst`. The fence pairs with the SeqCst
   load `IrqTable::try_wait_step` performs on `ready`,
   guaranteeing every CPU that observes `ready = true` also
   observes the masked redirection entry. The host test
   `ioapic_controller_mask_before_wake_ordering` in
   `kernel/tairix-kernel::ioapic_controller` drives this exact
   path against a `RecordingMmio` mock and asserts the mask write
   completes before `IrqTable::fire` returns `Marked`.

The `KernelArch` trait extension surface is two new methods:
`irq_routing(&self) -> IrqRouting` (consulted during
`Phase::Irq`) and `install_irq_dispatch(&self, &'static
IrqTable)` (called by `kernel/core::init` immediately after the
table is constructed, used by the arch port to publish the
table pointer into its dispatcher slot). Both have safe default
impls so non-x86_64 ports inherit the conservative
`IrqRouting::unsupported` behaviour without source-level change.

### x86_64 QEMU validation (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.2 QEMU)

`tests/integration/irq_qemu_x86_64` is the end-to-end regression
bound for the x86_64 trap path. The crate is a freestanding
`x86_64-tairix-none` kernel binary that reuses
`tairix_kernel::boot` verbatim and installs a custom audit Sink.
On observing `AuditEvent::BootCompleted` the sink:

1. Reads the published `IrqTable` through
   `tairix_kernel::arch_wrapper::published_irq_table` and the
   typed `IoApicController<VolatileIoApicMmio>` through
   `tairix_kernel::ioapic_controller::published_typed`. Both
   accessors expose state already published into set-once slots
   during boot; they perform no new writes (`AGENTS.md` §2.1).
2. Resolves the IDT vector assigned to GSI 2 (legacy ISA IRQ 0
   under QEMU's PIIX/Q35 `InterruptSourceOverride { source: 0,
   gsi: 2 }` mapping) via
   `tairix_arch_x86_64::irq::global_routing().vector_for_gsi(2)`.
3. Binds GSI 2 in the `IrqTable` against the synthesised
   `TaskId(0)`, masks the legacy 8259 PIC, unmasks the line via
   `IoApicController::unmask`, and arms PIT channel 0 in mode 0
   as a one-shot (architectural 1.193182 MHz × 2000-tick reload
   ≈ 1.68 ms).
4. `sti`s, then spin-polls `IrqTable::try_wait_step` with `hlt`
   between polls and a 1 s deadline. The asm trampoline +
   `production_external_irq_dispatch` chain delivers the IRQ →
   the dispatcher calls `IrqTable::fire(2, controller)` → the
   controller masks the line + SeqCst-fences → `ready` flips →
   `try_wait_step` observes `WaitStep::Ready`.
5. `cli`s and re-reads the IO-APIC redirection-entry low half via
   `IoApicController::read_pin_low(2)`. Asserts `low & (1 << 16)
   != 0` — the load-bearing evidence that the controller's mask
   write reached the IO-APIC MMIO window before the wake.
6. Flips `qemu_exit::exit_success`. Any deviation —
   missing slot, no vector bound, `WaitStep::TimedOut`,
   `WaitStep::NotFound`, mask bit clear — flips
   `qemu_exit::exit_failure` with the QEMU serial log attached
   by `tools/qemu::Runner`.

The crate is enrolled in `tools/xtask::commands::qemu_tests::TESTS`
with a 60 s budget. `cargo xtask test --qemu` builds and runs it
alongside the other five freestanding integration crates.

### x86_64 MSI/MSI-X routing (dedicated vectors, `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D7)

A PCI device that delivers **message-signalled** interrupts (MSI/MSI-X)
writes a chosen vector straight to the local-APIC doorbell — an *edge*
message that never uses an IO-APIC pin. `kernel/tairix-kernel/src/x86_64/msi.rs`
models this the way Linux (and the aarch64 `MSI_LINE_BASE` range) does,
rather than reusing an IO-APIC pin:

1. **Dedicated vectors + a virtual line space.** After the boot pipeline
   assigns one IDT vector per IO-APIC pin, `msi::install_msi_lines` claims
   the remaining free external vectors (`0x30..=0xFE`) as MSI vectors:
   each gets its IDT entry and a `vector → MSI line` entry in the arch
   routing table, but **no** IO-APIC redirection entry. The MSI lines live
   in a virtual range at `MSI_LINE_BASE` (far above any real GSI), so an
   MSI line and a GSI can never alias. A driver allocates a dedicated
   `(vector, line)` with `msi::allocate` and binds the line in the
   `IrqTable` exactly as it would a GSI.
2. **Edge controller.** `msi::CompositeIrqController` is the one
   line→controller fan-out published as `IrqRouting.controller`: a real
   GSI masks/unmasks the `IoApicController` redirection entry; an MSI line
   is an edge source with **no** hardware line to mask, so its
   `mask`/`rearm` are honest no-ops — the `IrqTable` ready-flag consume is
   the whole re-arm interlock, and the runaway-interrupt safety net still
   contains a storming vector. The bootstrap virtio-blk-PCI root
   (`root_unlock::virtio_blk_unlock`) routes its MSI-X through a dedicated
   vector and binds the MSI line, never a shared IO-APIC pin.

**Interrupted-frame offset (the D7 triple fault).** The external-IRQ
trampoline (`external_irq.s`) pushes a synthetic *vector qword* between the
15-GPR `SavedRegs` block and the CPU-pushed `InterruptStackFrame`; the
timer stub (`define_isr!`) does not. `preempt::preempt_ring3_if_pending`
therefore takes the `InterruptStackFrame` pointer explicitly — each ISR
computes it at its own offset (`regs + size_of::<SavedRegs>()` for the
timer, one `EXTERNAL_VECTOR_QWORD_BYTES` more for the external path).
Reading it one qword too low mis-decoded the interrupted `CS`, ran an
unbalanced `swapgs`, and triple-faulted a later `syscall` (`kernel_rsp0`
loaded from a null GS base). The host guard
`irq::tests::external_irq_frame_sits_one_vector_qword_above_saved_regs`
pins the two sizes the offset is built from; the QEMU regression is
`tests/integration/root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` (a D7 regression
triple-faults before any `/System` mount).

### riscv64 trap glue (Stage 4.D Item 4 — riscv64 external-IRQ controller)

The riscv64 port supplies the same `IrqController` seam through a
PLIC, plus the S-mode trap vector that turns a hardware external
interrupt into an `IrqTable::fire`. The PLIC register driver and trap
glue are a pure Arch HAL implementation and own no `kernel/irq`
dependency (`AGENTS.md` §17.2); the `IrqController` bridge
(`PlicIrqController`) lives downstream in
`tests/integration/riscv64_boot`. The pieces are implemented and
host-tested; the boot-to-`BootCompleted` slice does not yet arm them
(the `virt` board reaches `BootCompleted` with interrupts disabled),
so the virtio-mmio verticals are the first consumer.

1. **PLIC controller.** `kernel/arch/riscv64::plic::PlicController`
   wraps a `Plic<M>` register driver over the `PlicMmio` access seam
   (`VolatilePlicMmio` on the freestanding target, an in-memory mock
   in host tests). `arm(source)` enables the source in the boot
   hart's S-mode context bitmap, drops the context threshold to zero,
   and sets a delivering priority; `claim` / `complete` wrap the
   per-context claim register.
2. **Mask-before-wake.** The inherent `PlicController::mask` masks a
   source by writing its **priority register to zero** — a single
   32-bit MMIO store, after which the source can never out-prioritise
   the (zero) threshold and so cannot re-fire — then issues a
   `core::sync::atomic::fence` with `Ordering::SeqCst`. The downstream
   `PlicIrqController` bridge's `IrqController::mask` forwards here. The
   single-store strategy is lock-free: it never read-modify-writes a
   shared word, so it races neither the trap handler's claim/complete
   nor a concurrent arm/unmask on another source. The host test
   `mask_before_wake_through_irq_table` (in `tests/integration/riscv64_boot`)
   drives `IrqTable::fire` with the bridge and asserts the priority-zero
   write is the last register write before `fire` returns `Marked`.
3. **S-mode trap vector.** `kernel/arch/riscv64::trap` publishes
   `tairix_riscv64_trap_vector` (`trap.s`) and installs it into
   `stvec` (direct mode) via `init_traps`, which also sets
   `sie.SEIE` and `sstatus.SIE`. The vector saves the interrupted
   context's caller-saved registers, calls the Rust handler, restores,
   and `sret`s.
4. **Dispatch.** The Rust handler reads `scause`. A synchronous
   exception is unexpected in this slice and fails closed by parking
   the hart (rather than `sret`-looping the faulting instruction). A
   supervisor external interrupt
   (`is_supervisor_external_interrupt`) forwards to the one-shot
   `set_trap_dispatch` callback, which — like the x86_64 dispatcher —
   holds the controller reference and performs the PLIC claim →
   `IrqTable::fire` (mask-before-wake) → complete handshake.

The `scause` decode, the `sie`/`sstatus`/`scause` bit constants, and
the set-once dispatch slot build on the host so their unit tests run
under `cargo test`; the trap vector, `init_traps`, the handler, and
`VolatilePlicMmio` are gated to `riscv64-unknown-none-elf`.

### aarch64 GICv2 device-IRQ glue (Stage W3-B)

The aarch64 port supplies the same `IrqController` seam through a
GICv2, plus the EL1 IRQ vector path that turns a device's
shared-peripheral interrupt (SPI) into an `IrqTable::fire`. The GICv2
driver and exception glue are a pure Arch HAL implementation and own no
`kernel/irq` dependency (`AGENTS.md` §17.2); the `IrqController` bridge
(`GicBridge`) lives downstream in `tests/integration/irq_qemu_aarch64`,
mirroring riscv64's `PlicIrqController`. The boot-to-`BootCompleted`
slice does not yet arm a device IRQ (the timer PPI has its own path), so
the QEMU vertical is the first consumer.

1. **SPI target-routing.** GICv2 SPIs reset to *no* CPU target, so a
   device interrupt is never delivered until its `GICD_ITARGETSR` byte
   names a CPU. `kernel/arch/aarch64::gic::Gicv2::route_spi(intid,
   cpu_targets)` writes that byte — the SPI analogue of the x86_64
   IO-APIC redirection-entry destination field. INTIDs below
   `MIN_SPI_INTID` (32) are SGIs/PPIs whose target bytes are read-only
   and banked per CPU, so the routing write is skipped for them (a
   no-op rather than a silently-ignored read-only store).
2. **Mask-before-wake.** The HAL `GicController::mask` clears the
   source's distributor enable bit (`ICENABLER`) and issues a
   `core::sync::atomic::fence` with `Ordering::SeqCst`. The downstream
   `GicBridge::mask` forwards here. The fence pairs with the SeqCst
   load `IrqTable::try_wait_step` performs on `ready`, so every CPU
   that observes `ready = true` also observes the masked line.
3. **EL1 IRQ vector.** `kernel/arch/aarch64::exceptions` installs the
   EL1 vector table (`VBAR_EL1`) and, on an IRQ, acknowledges the GIC
   (`IAR`). The timer PPI dispatches to the scheduler-tick path; **any
   other** acknowledged INTID is a device interrupt and is forwarded to
   the set-once device-IRQ dispatcher. The GIC end-of-interrupt
   handshake (`EOIR`) stays in the vector path.
4. **Dispatch.** `exceptions::set_device_irq_dispatch` publishes a
   one-shot `extern "C" fn(u32)` into a fail-closed (set-once)
   `AtomicUsize` slot — the EL1 analogue of riscv64's
   `set_trap_dispatch`. The installed dispatcher services the device
   source and forwards the line to `IrqTable::fire` (mask-before-wake)
   over the `GicBridge`.

The `GICD_ITARGETSR` arithmetic, the `MIN_SPI_INTID` boundary, and the
set-once dispatch slot build on the host so their unit tests run under
`cargo test`; the `route_spi` free function, `init_vectors`, the IRQ
handler, and `VolatileGicMmio` are gated to `aarch64-unknown-none`.

### aarch64 QEMU validation (Stage W3-B)

`tests/integration/irq_qemu_aarch64` is the end-to-end regression bound
for the aarch64 device-IRQ path — the EL1/SPI analogue of the x86_64
crate above. The freestanding `aarch64-unknown-none` kernel binary:

1. Builds a kernel-neutral `IrqTable` and binds the PL031 RTC's GICv2
   SPI (INTID 34 = `MIN_SPI_INTID + 2`) against the synthesised
   `TaskId(0)`, then publishes a pointer to the table for the
   interrupt-context dispatcher.
2. Installs the `rtc_dispatch` device-IRQ dispatcher via
   `set_device_irq_dispatch` (which forwards to `IrqTable::fire` over
   the `GicBridge`), installs the EL1 vectors, and brings up the GICv2.
3. Routes the RTC SPI to CPU 0 (`gic::route_spi`), enables it at the
   distributor, arms the RTC match register one tick (~1 s) out, and
   unmasks IRQs at the PE.
4. Parks on `wfi` and spin-polls `IrqTable::try_wait_step`. When the
   RTC fires, the GIC delivers the SPI to EL1 → the vector
   acknowledges and calls `rtc_dispatch` → the dispatcher clears the
   RTC and calls `IrqTable::fire(34, &BRIDGE)` → the bridge masks the
   line + SeqCst-fences → `ready` flips → `try_wait_step` observes
   `WaitStep::Ready`.
5. Re-reads `GICD_ISENABLER` for INTID 34 and asserts the enable bit
   is clear — the load-bearing evidence that the mask write reached the
   distributor MMIO before the wake.
6. Flips `qemu_exit::exit_success`. Any deviation — `bind` refusal,
   duplicate dispatcher, `WaitStep::TimedOut`/`NotFound`, or an
   un-masked line — flips `qemu_exit::exit_failure`; a line that never
   fires never reaches PASS, so the run times out (the documented
   fail-loud behaviour).

The crate is enrolled in `tools/xtask::commands::qemu_tests::TESTS`
with a 60 s budget. `cargo xtask test --qemu` builds and runs it
alongside the other freestanding integration crates.

### Test coverage

* `kernel/irq` unit tests cover bind / duplicate
  refusal / out-of-range refusal / ready-after-fire / timeout /
  forgery (no binding, wrong caller) / mask-before-wake ordering /
  controller errors / stray-IRQ containment / release_for
  semantics / handle-uniqueness across rebinds, plus the
  runaway-line quarantine: a storm past the rate budget in one
  window trips it (no ready delivered, `WaitStep::Quarantined`),
  fires spread across windows never trip it, a fresh bind clears a
  previous quarantine, `is_quarantined` is owner-checked, an
  uninstalled clock leaves accounting inert, and
  `block_until_ready` surfaces `WaitOutcome::Quarantined` without
  yielding. `owner_of_line` (the read-only, owner-agnostic lookup the
  CPU-lockup watchdog uses to attribute a stuck controller line to the
  driver that bound it) is covered too: it names a bound line's owner,
  is `None` for an unbound line, and returns to `None` after the owner's
  bindings are released.
* `kernel/core::syscalls::tests` adds syscall-handler tests
  (mint / out-of-range / duplicate / forgery / timeout / pre-fired
  ready), an `exit_releases_every_irq_binding_owned_by_task` test
  asserting the `exit` ↔ `release_for` ordering, and
  `irq_wait_reports_a_quarantined_line_as_device_fault` proving a
  quarantined line fails the waiter closed with `DeviceFault` and
  emits the `IRQ_LINE_QUARANTINED` audit record naming the line.
* `kernel/tairix-kernel::ioapic_controller` adds host tests for
  `program_pin`, `mask`, `unmask`, `read_pin_low`, multi-IO-APIC
  routing, the mask-before-wake ordering against a
  `RecordingMmio` mock, and out-of-range / unprogrammed-pin
  fail-closed paths.
* `kernel/tairix-kernel::arch_wrapper` adds host tests pinning
  the set-once semantics of the `published_irq_controller` slot
  and the "still-None until installed" invariant of the
  `published_irq_table` slot.
* `kernel/arch/riscv64::plic` adds host tests for the SiFive PLIC
  register-offset arithmetic, the S-mode context interleaving,
  `arm` / `unmask` / out-of-range refusal, `claim` / `complete`
  round-trip, the enable-bitmap toggle, and the mask-before-wake
  ordering through `IrqTable` against an in-memory `MockPlicMmio`.
* `kernel/arch/riscv64::trap` adds host tests for the `scause`
  supervisor-external-interrupt decode (incl. rejecting the same
  code as a synchronous exception and other interrupt causes), the
  `sie`/`sstatus`/`scause` bit constants, and the set-once
  fail-closed semantics of the trap-dispatch slot.
* `kernel/arch/aarch64::gic` adds host tests for the `GICD_ITARGETSR`
  offset arithmetic, the `MIN_SPI_INTID` boundary, `route_spi` writing
  the target byte for an SPI, and `route_spi` skipping SGIs/PPIs
  (read-only banked target bytes), on top of the existing
  `GicController` mask/claim conformance coverage.
* `kernel/arch/aarch64::exceptions` adds host tests for the set-once
  device-IRQ dispatch slot: fail-closed on a second install and the
  installed-fn address round-trip.
* `tests/integration/irq_qemu_x86_64` and
  `tests/integration/irq_qemu_aarch64` are the QEMU-validated
  end-to-end regression bounds described above.
