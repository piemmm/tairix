# Per-task capability registry

`kernel/sec::captable` ships two layers of capability state:

* `TaskCapabilities` — one record per task: the intersection of the
  owning user's grant and the task's signed manifest request, plus
  delegate / revoke / signed-token application. This layer landed in
  Stage 2.4 and is documented in
  [`architecture/security.md`](../architecture/security.md).
* `CapTable` — the `TaskId → TaskCapabilities` lookup the syscall
  dispatcher consults after the per-CPU current-task slot
  ([`Scheduler::current_task`](../architecture/scheduler.md#current-task-slot))
  has named the caller. This is Stage 2.7 follow-up (f2) and is
  described below.

## Process-instance identity (`ProcId`)

Each `TaskCapabilities` record also carries a kernel-generated
**process-instance identity**, `tairix_abi::ProcId` — a 128-bit value
distinct from the reusable numeric `TaskId` / PID. The kernel hands out
task ids from a recycled space, so two process lifetimes can reuse a
numeric id; they never share a `ProcId`. Security attribution can
therefore distinguish "the login that ran as PID 42 this morning" from "the
shell that reused PID 42 this afternoon".

The id is minted entirely kernel-side (`kernel/core::proc_id`) at the two
process-admit paths — the `spawn` syscall (drawing from the single kernel
CSPRNG output reserve) and the early-boot bootstrap principals, PID 1 and
the storage-floor drivers (the per-boot monotonic counter alone, since the
reserve is not yet seeded that early). The monotonic counter guarantees
uniqueness within a boot independently of entropy; the random half adds
unpredictability and cross-boot distinctness. User space never supplies or
influences the value, so a task can neither forge another instance's
identity nor predict its own. Records that are not a distinct user process
instance — kernel threads, IPC-binder and device-host capability records —
keep the reserved all-zero `ProcId::KERNEL` sentinel.

Because the record is the per-syscall caller context the dispatcher
consults (`CallerContext::caps`), every security-relevant audit record the
dispatcher emits carries the caller's attested `proc` field beside the
numeric `task` field, so the hash-chained log attributes each decision to
the exact instance that took it. The attestation is the kernel's, never the
caller's.

### Parentage (`parent_proc_id`)

The record also carries the **parent's** process-instance identity — the
`ProcId` of the process that spawned this one. Like `proc_id` it is minted
kernel-side and copied onto the child at admit from the *parent's own*
kernel-held capability record (`caps_for(parent).proc_id()`), never from a
caller-supplied value, so a task can neither forge nor influence its
recorded parentage. Because it is the parent's instance identity rather than
its recyclable numeric id, parentage survives PID reuse exactly as `proc_id`
does for the task itself: the log can tell "the shell spawned by *this*
login instance" from "the shell spawned by a later login that reused the
numeric id". A task with no distinct user-process parent — PID 1, the
storage bootstrap-floor drivers, kernel threads — records the reserved
all-zero `ProcId::KERNEL` sentinel.

Every security-relevant dispatcher audit record therefore carries the
caller's attested `pproc` field beside `proc` and `task`, so the
hash-chained log records the exact parent instance of each acting process.

### Process name (`comm`)

The record also carries a kernel-attested **process name**
(`tairix_kernel_sec::ProcName`, a bounded inline name reusing the one
`PROCESS_NAME_MAX` length `tairix_abi` already defines for the System
Information process record). It is set kernel-side at admit from
kernel-resolved state, through the one shared naming rule
(`ProcName::from_path`): a bundle's generic `Run` entry point never names a
process — every bundle shares that leaf — so a final `Run` component attests
the owning bundle directory's stem instead (`.app` suffix stripped:
`/Apps/Example.app/Run` → `Example`, a driver bundle
`/System/Drivers/input/usb_hid/Run` → `usb_hid`); any other path attests its
final non-empty component, and a path from which no name is derivable keeps
the whole path bytes so a listing always shows something truthful. The
`spawn` syscall applies the rule to the resolved executable path (the
registry/store lookup matched it, so it is not the caller's word for its own
name), the driver-spawn seam applies it to the kernel-resolved driver-store
path the signed load gate verified the image from (never the spawner's
argv), and PID 1 records the fixed `init`.
Every process a listing (`ps`, `top`) shows therefore carries a non-empty
attested name; only in-kernel binder / device-host records that never enter
the process table keep the empty name. The stored value holds only a
valid-UTF-8 prefix, so rendering it never fails.

Every security-relevant dispatcher audit record therefore carries the
caller's attested `comm` field beside `task`, `proc`, and `pproc`, so the
hash-chained log names the acting process (not only its numeric and instance
ids). One `audit_with_identity` helper in `kernel/syscall` emits this
attested identity prefix, so the audit sites cannot drift in which fields
they record. The attestation is the kernel's, never the caller's.

### Admission time (`start_time`)

The record also carries a kernel-attested **admission timestamp**: the value
the Arch HAL monotonic counter (`ticks_now`) read at the instant the process
was admitted. It is snapshotted kernel-side by the process-admit path
(`with_start_time`), never supplied or influenced by any caller, so an audit
or origin consumer may trust it to order and age a process instance — and, in
particular, to tell apart two lifetimes that reused the same numeric id even
within one monotonic epoch, complementing the random half of `proc_id`. A task
admitted before user-process start tracking runs — PID 1, the storage
bootstrap-floor drivers, kernel threads — keeps the `0` boot sentinel, meaning
"started at boot", exactly as those principals keep the `ProcId::KERNEL`
sentinel. The value confers no capability; it is identity only.

Every security-relevant dispatcher audit record therefore carries the caller's
attested `start` field (a typed unsigned integer) beside `task`, `proc`,
`pproc`, and `comm`, all emitted through the one `audit_with_identity` helper
in `kernel/syscall` so the sites cannot drift. The attestation is the
kernel's, never the caller's.

### Group credential (`primary_gid` / supplementary groups) and spawn-as-user

Beyond the owning `uid` the record has always carried, each
`TaskCapabilities` now also carries the task's **primary group** and
**supplementary groups** — the rest of its POSIX-style credential. Together
`(uid, primary gid, supplementary gids)` is the kernel-attested identity the
filesystem permission model checks against and the attested
`tairix_abi::Origin` reports (the `Origin` gained a `gid` field alongside its
`uid`). The groups confer **no** capability — authority still flows only
through the effective set — they are identity for the per-inode
owner/mode/ACL checks.

The credential is fixed at process creation and resolved one of three ways,
all kernel-side (never a caller-supplied value):

* **inherit** — the default `spawn` (`SPAWN_UID_INHERIT`): the child is
  admitted under a snapshot of the spawning parent's *own* attested
  credential, so a child runs as the same user as its parent. No capability
  is required to run a child as oneself.
* **switch** — a concrete `target_uid` argument: the kernel resolves that
  user's full credential from the authoritative `IdentityTable` (the same
  set-once table the filesystem service resolves caller groups against) and
  drops the child into it. This is the **only** way a task's credential
  differs from its parent's, and it requires the caller to hold the new
  `CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER` capability; it fails closed with `PermissionDenied`
  without it, and `NotImplemented` / `PermissionDenied` when the target is
  unresolvable. Its sole holder is the `login` session manager, which starts
  an authenticated user's shell under that user. A running process can never
  mutate its *own* identity — there is no setuid-self.
* **system** — the kernel's own bootstrap principals (PID 1, the
  storage-floor drivers) are admitted under the fixed system credential
  (uid 0 / gid 0). uid 0 carries no ambient authority.

The credential is snapshotted onto the record by the process-admit path
(`with_credential`), exactly as `proc_id` / `parent_proc_id` / `comm` are, so
it is authoritative and immune to caller spoofing.

## Per-task registry

`CapTable` owns a flat `BTreeMap<TaskId, TaskCapabilities>`. It carries
no interior mutability: the owning scope — `KernelState` in
`kernel/core::init` — composes it with the scheduler under a single
lock-ordering policy and provides whichever reader/writer
synchronisation primitive is appropriate. The same shape of access
pattern already drives `Scheduler::tasks` (many concurrent syscall-
context readers, occasional task-creation writers), so a
reader-preferring `lib/sync::RwLock` mirrors that policy.

### Lifecycle

| event                                | registry effect                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| task creation (manifest verified, caps derived) | `CapTable::insert(caps)` registers the record  |
| syscall `cap_query` / handler reads  | `CapTable::caps_for(task_id) -> &TaskCapabilities`    |
| syscall `cap_delegate`               | `CapTable::narrow(caller, target, set)`: authority over `target` first, then `TaskCapabilities::delegate` |
| syscall `cap_revoke`                 | `CapTable::caps_for_mut(task_id) -> &mut TaskCapabilities` then mutate via `TaskCapabilities::revoke` |
| `Scheduler::exit(task_id)` returned  | `CapTable::remove(task_id)` evicts the record         |

`CapTable::insert` returns the previously-registered record for the
same `TaskId` if any, surfacing the duplicate rather than silently
overwriting. `kernel/sched` does not recycle task ids within a single
scheduler instance (see
[`architecture/scheduler.md`](../architecture/scheduler.md) §
Invariants), so a non-`None` return is an anomaly the caller is
expected to audit / refuse.

`CapTable::remove` returns the evicted record so the caller can zero
out any sensitive capability material in line with the kernel
allocator's "zero-on-free for credential-holding memory" requirement
(`AGENTS.md` §4).

### No ambient authority on lookup

Lookups never widen the stored capability set. `caps_for(task)`
returns `Some(&TaskCapabilities)` only when `insert` has stored a
record for that exact id; there is no implicit grant, no "fall back to
root" branch, and no policy hook that consults the numeric uid.
`TaskCapabilities::derive` enforces the user-grant ∩ manifest-request
invariant on the way in, so the registry's stored value is
already bounded.

### `caps_for` vs `caps_for_mut`

`caps_for` is the predicate the dispatcher uses for `cap_query` and
for the capability checks the IPC entry points apply before any state
is touched (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 step 2 — check capabilities **before**
state). `caps_for_mut` is the entry point the dispatcher uses for
`cap_delegate` / `cap_revoke`: it returns a mutable borrow into the
same record, on which the caller invokes
`TaskCapabilities::{delegate,revoke,apply_token}`. Those methods
preserve the subset-only delegation invariant in `lib/caps` and emit
the appropriate audit events; the registry itself never widens or
synthesises capability state. A record branded a parser sandbox
(`as_sandboxed()`, set only by the spawn admit path for a
`SPAWN_FLAG_SANDBOX` child — `docs/src/security/sandbox.md`) carries
every capability set forced empty, and `delegate`/`apply_token` refuse
it outright before examining any payload.

## Wiring / Lifecycle

Stage 2.7 follow-up (f4) wires `CapTable` into `KernelState`, the
in-memory record `kernel_main` builds during the init phases. The
table is placed under a reader-preferring `lib/sync::RwLock`, the
same primitive `Scheduler::tasks` uses, so the syscall dispatcher's
hot path (the `cap_query` predicate and the IPC capability checks)
takes only a shared lock:

```text
KernelState {
    scheduler:  Scheduler<A>,
    caps:       RwLock<CapTable>,   // (f4) — composed under the same lock-ordering policy
    arch:       Arc<A>,
    audit_sink: &'static (dyn Sink + Sync),
    // ...
}
```

Lock-ordering policy: every dispatcher entry point identifies the
caller through the per-CPU current-task slot **first**, then takes
either `caps.read()` (for `cap_query` and the IPC capability checks)
or `caps.write()` (for `cap_delegate` / `cap_revoke`). The lock is
held only for the duration of the in-registry mutation; the
`TaskCapabilities` reference handed to `CallerContext` lives inside
the read-guard, so a concurrent `cap_revoke` waits until the active
syscall returns. `AGENTS.md` §5.4 step 1 ("identify the caller")
explicitly forbids re-locking mid-dispatch: the registry is consulted
exactly once per syscall.

`KernelState` is one-shot `Box::leak`'d during the `Syscall` init
phase so the `KernelDispatchHook` published into the
[`DispatchCallbackSlot`](../architecture/kernel.md#syscall-registration-phase)
can borrow `&state.caps` for the lifetime of the running kernel. The
leak is immutable after publish and is therefore **not** a global
mutable static (`AGENTS.md` §2.1); the interior `RwLock` is the only
sanctioned mutation site. The kernel never returns from
`kernel_main`'s halt, so the leak is a one-shot publish, not a
resource leak in any operational sense.

A boot path that finds the slot already holding a hook (programmer
error: double `kernel_main` entry; test harness pre-population)
surfaces `InitError::DispatcherAlreadyInstalled` under
`phase = "syscall"`, `cause = "syscall_dispatcher_already_installed"`,
and halts. No silent recovery — `AGENTS.md` §5.4.5.

## Out of scope for Stage 2.7 follow-up (f2)

* User-space task creation. The follow-up does not add a user-space
  loader; `CapTable::insert` is exercised by tests and by the future
  init(1) loader (Stage 6).
* The signing-key authority for capability tokens. `lib/crypto` already
  ships the verifier; the per-installation authority key generation
  lives in the installer (Stage 8 / `AGENTS.md` §11.5).
* IPC named-port registry — since landed: `kernel/ipc::PortRegistry` is
  composed into `KernelState`, the `ipc_send`/`ipc_recv` handlers resolve
  endpoints against it (an unbound endpoint fails closed with
  `Errno::NotFound`), and the `port_resolve` syscall resolves a published
  `PortName` from user space (see
  [the IPC page](../architecture/ipc.md#well-known-names)).
