# The parser sandbox: minimum-capability worker processes

`AGENTS.md` §19.5 requires every parser of untrusted input to run in a
minimum-capability sandbox process. This page documents the kernel
primitive that makes such a process exist: the **sandbox spawn mode**,
requested by a flag in the spawn attach block and enforced entirely
kernel-side. The user-space seam that hands bytes to a sandboxed parser
and receives the typed result (with crash containment and worker
replacement) builds on this primitive and is staged in
`plans/APPS.md` S8b.

## Requesting a sandbox

A spawn becomes a sandbox spawn by setting `SPAWN_FLAG_SANDBOX` in the
`SpawnAttach` block's `flags` word (`lib/abi/src/process.rs`; C callers
use `TAIRIX_SPAWN_FLAG_SANDBOX`). The flag can only ever *narrow* the
child, so the flag itself costs no authority — but the spawn still needs
one of the two spawn capabilities below.

A sandbox block is canonical only when nothing ambient can flow into the
child, and `SpawnAttach::parse` refuses any other shape fail-closed —
one definition shared by the kernel's staging path and every userland
encoder:

- **Every fd wire is explicit.** Each of the four standard-descriptor
  wires must be `Closed` or `Handle` — never `Inherit` or `InheritSlot`.
  The only channels a sandbox holds are the descriptors its parent
  deliberately handed over (typically a pipe pair).
- **No credential switch.** `target_uid` must be `SPAWN_UID_INHERIT`.
- **No console.** The console selector must be `CONSOLE_INHERIT`; a
  console index would attach console-backed streams, which a sandbox
  never receives.
- **Its owner's life.** The session selector must be `Anchored`, the session
  anchored at the owner, so a worker ends when its owner does — crash
  included — rather than lingering until the owner's whole session ends
  (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`).
- **No reserved flag bits.** Any undefined `flags` bit refuses the block.

A worker is re-spawned from its owner's own program, so the process list
would show it under its owner's name. Each process record therefore carries
the kernel's sandbox mark (`PROCESS_FLAG_SANDBOXED`), and a worker's parent
link names its owner.

## Which capability admits the spawn

`spawn` carries no dispatcher-level capability, because the authority a
spawn needs depends on the attach block that only the handler decodes
(the same shape as `stream_write`'s console arm). The handler checks it in
two steps, both before any address space exists:

1. **Coarse, first statement.** A caller holding neither
   `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` nor `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` is refused before the path is
   bounded, the attach block staged, or a descriptor resolved.
2. **Precise, once the mode is known.** A canonical sandbox block is
   admitted by **either** capability; every other spawn requires
   `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`.

`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` exists so that a principal which must decode
untrusted input away from its own address space does not also have to
hold the authority to start a general process. The graphical login screen
is the motivating holder: it decodes the wallpaper in a capability-empty
worker, and a compromise of it still cannot start the session it
authenticates for. `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` subsumes the narrow one — a principal
that may start *any* process may obviously start a restricted one — so no
existing holder of the broad capability needs it as well.

Both refusals fail closed with the same audited `ProcessSpawnDenied`
record and build no page table, so a `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`-only caller that
asks for a general child leaves nothing behind but the audit entry. The
rule has one definition — `SpawnMode::admits` in
`kernel/core/src/spawn.rs` — read by both the syscall handler and the
image builder.

## What the kernel enforces

Three layers, each fail-closed, each with its own tests:

1. **Empty capability sets, structurally** (`kernel/sec`). The spawn
   admit path brands the child's `TaskCapabilities` with
   `as_sandboxed()`, which discards the user grant, the manifest
   request, and the effective set — whatever the program's manifest
   asked for. Because all three sets are dropped, no later re-derivation
   can resurrect a capability. `delegate` and `apply_token` refuse a
   sandboxed target outright (`PermissionDenied`, audited as a widening
   attempt) before looking at the payload, so not even a validly signed
   token can land capabilities on a sandbox.
2. **A closed syscall allow-list** (`kernel/syscall`). The dispatcher
   refuses every syscall from a sandboxed task except
   `sandbox_allows`'s list, *before* the per-syscall capability check
   and before any handler runs:

   `yield`, `exit`, `stream_read`, `stream_write`, `fs_read`,
   `fs_write`, `fs_close`, `mem_map`, `mem_unmap`

   These are exactly the self-scoped and descriptor-scoped operations a
   worker needs: run, block on and talk over the wired descriptors, and
   manage its own heap. Everything that names an object outside the
   task — a path (`fs_open`), an IPC endpoint, a resource reference, a
   process (`spawn`/`signal`/`wait`), a device, system state — is
   refused, so a compromised parser cannot even probe those surfaces.
   Each denial is audited with the stable `SyscallPermissionDenied`
   event. Widening the list is a security decision held to the
   capability-minimalism bar, and the exact list is frozen by a unit
   test.
3. **Descriptor-scoped I/O only.** `fs_read`/`fs_write`/`fs_close` and
   `stream_read`/`stream_write` operate on the caller's own descriptor
   table — authority the parent established at spawn — and a
   console-backed stream additionally requires `CAP_CONSOLE_READ`/
   `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` in-handler, which a sandbox (empty set) can never
   hold. With canonical wires a sandbox has no console-backed stream in
   the first place.

The parent keeps full lifecycle authority over its child: `wait` reaps
it, `signal` can kill it, and a crashed worker is observed exactly like
any other abnormal child exit. Nothing about the sandbox brand weakens
the parent's side.

## The user-space seam: `lib/sandbox`

The kernel primitive makes a sandboxed process *exist*; `lib/sandbox`
(`tairix-sandbox`) is the one user-space seam that makes it *usable*, so
the containment discipline is written once and every program that
sandboxes a parse imports it:

- **Protocol** (`proto`): a length-framed byte protocol over any
  bidirectional `Channel` (pipes in production, in-memory fakes in host
  tests), bounded by `MAX_FRAME`. Both sides refuse an oversize declared
  length before reading or allocating a payload byte.
- **Worker** (`worker`): `serve` reads a request frame, hands the payload
  to a total `Service`, writes the reply frame, and ends cleanly when the
  parent closes the request stream. A malformed request is a typed error
  *reply*, never a panic.
- **Host side** (`host`): `ParserSandbox` sends one request and blocks
  for the reply. Every worker failure — crash, protocol violation,
  oversize reply, exit without answering — is contained identically: the
  caller receives a typed `SandboxError`, the dead worker is reaped and
  **replaced**, and the event is logged with a stable id
  (`EventId(6000)` worker crashed, `EventId(6001)` worker unavailable;
  the crate owns `6000..7000`). A parser crash never takes down the
  calling program.
- **Duplex sessions** (`session`): the long-lived seam beside that
  one-shot pair, for a worker that serves a *protocol* rather than
  answering a question. `SandboxSession` never blocks — the owner drives
  it from a wait-set over the two descriptors the transport reports, with
  `Stream` on the reply end and `StreamRoom` on the request end — many
  frames are in flight each way, and one inbound frame may be answered
  with none or several. A failed worker is disposed of and **not**
  replaced (`EventId(6002)`, session failed), because unlike a parse it
  held the connection's protocol state, so a silent replacement would be
  a correctness hole rather than resilience. Both queues are bounded and
  committed at admission, so what one session costs is known before it is
  admitted rather than discovered when the memory is gone; a refused send
  is either permanently too large for the bound or transiently short of
  room, and the two are distinct typed answers so an owner knows whether
  to back off or give up. A frame the worker declares above the owner's
  inbound bound, and a stream that ends part-way through one, are both
  protocol violations that contain the session.
  Deadlock-freedom is structural rather than argued: the allow-list gives
  the worker no wait-set call, no clock, and no RNG, so its pipe is the
  only thing that can ever wake it, and it may therefore use the ordinary
  blocking channel — a worker blocked writing is freed by the parent's
  read readiness, and one blocked reading by the parent's room readiness.
  That second leg is why `StreamRoom` exists at all. `recv` lends each
  frame in place rather than copying it out, so taking a frame never
  allocates: an event loop can never be left holding a frame it has no
  memory to take, readable and unable to drain.
- **Supervised sessions** (`supervise`): the duplex seam for a worker that
  serves a *service* rather than one connection. `SupervisedSession`
  starts each worker through a `SessionLauncher` and reports each start
  as a new generation. The owner drops what it derived from the old worker
  and sends the new one what it needs, so a replacement is correct here,
  where it would not be for a connection. Every failure is reaped and
  logged once (`EventId(6000)`; a refused launch is `EventId(6001)`). A
  worker that ends its stream has failed, and so has one whose frame the
  owner `condemn`s as unbelievable. Replacement is paced through the same
  `RestartPacer` mechanism as the service manager's restarts, on the session's
  own schedule: 100 ms, doubling to 30 s, forgotten after 30 s of stable
  service. A crafted input that kills the worker
  every time therefore costs its owner a spawn per backoff step, never a
  spawn per input.
- **Production transport** (`rt`, feature `program`, freestanding only):
  the parent spawns **its own binary** in a worker role — two fresh
  pipes wired to the child's fd 0/1 through `SpawnAttach::sandbox`, the
  `--parser-sandbox-worker` argv marker (or `--sandbox-session-worker`
  for the duplex seam, whose `RtSessionChannel` rides the same spawn
  through one shared pipe-pair-and-attach path), a blocking reap on
  disposal. The worker serves over its standard streams, exactly the
  surface the allow-list admits. "Its own binary" is named by the reserved
  `SPAWN_SELF` (`@self`) path token, never by `argv[0]` (data the
  spawner chose, not a spawnable spelling): the kernel substitutes the
  exact path it admitted the *caller* from — the `spawn_path` attested
  on its capability record — and runs the ordinary resolution and load
  gate over it. The token serves any spawn of the caller's own binary
  (sandboxed or plain — `plans/STRESSTEST.md`'s worker re-entry is the
  plain consumer) and only when the caller carries a spawnable path; a
  caller without one fails closed `NotFound`. `RtSessionLauncher` starts
  supervised workers the same way. `SessionMembers` keeps a session's two
  descriptors on the owner's wait-set exactly while the session wants
  them, and moves them to each generation's new pipe pair.
- **First consumers** (`decode`): executable-container summaries
  (`lib/binfmt`) and per-window instruction disassembly (`lib/disasm`)
  run inside the worker; the client-side helpers validate every reply
  field fail-closed, because a worker that has parsed hostile bytes is
  itself treated as hostile.
- **Help rendering** (`helpdoc`): a foreign bundle's help document is
  parsed and rendered inside the worker (`tairix_help`'s `HelpDoc::parse`
  plus the short/full renderers), and the parent-side `render_help`
  client re-parses the returned bytes through the `lib/vt` streaming
  parser, admitting only the closed op set a help render can contain
  (printable text, line feeds, the bold/underline SGR pairs) and
  re-encoding them canonically — the caller writes bytes its own process
  produced, never bytes the worker chose. A document-parse error crosses
  the boundary typed (`HelpError`, code for code), so diagnostics lose
  nothing to the isolation. `man` is the consumer: it locates and reads
  the document with its own file authority (`tairix_help::load_raw`),
  re-spawns itself as the worker (`CAP_PROC_SPAWN` in its manifest), and
  withholds the page — never falling back to an in-process parse — when
  the renderer fails.
- **Icon rasterisation** (`imagerender`): an application bundle's icon —
  SVG or PNG bytes shipped inside the bundle, not from the system — is
  sniffed, decoded, and rasterised to the caller's requested square side
  inside the worker (`tairix_svg`/`tairix_image`/`tairix_icon`/
  `tairix_raster`), and the parent-side `rasterise_icon` trusts nothing
  about the reply beyond its length and echoed side before handing the
  bytes to the compositor. A PNG source decodes through its own,
  tighter decode-time bounds (independent of the requested output side,
  so a small request cannot smuggle a huge source image past a small
  reply), is fitted inside the square preserving its aspect ratio, and is
  scaled through the crate's one shared resampler
  (`tairix_raster::resample`: a separable filtered resample in
  premultiplied-alpha space — the exact area integral when reducing, so a
  downscale blends instead of aliasing, and a Catmull-Rom cubic when
  enlarging, so an upscale is never a sample-and-hold); an SVG
  source rasterises directly through the shared vector-icon polygon-fill
  path. Either a typed refusal (unsupported format, a decode failure, or
  an unrenderable result) or a sandbox failure simply means the desktop
  session falls back to its own built-in glyph — never a crash.
- **Wallpaper placement** (also `imagerender`, the same worker): a
  desktop wallpaper — a shipped master or a file the user picked, never
  parsed outside the sandbox — is sniffed, decoded, and placed onto the
  session's screen size across three ops. `OP_WALLPAPER_PREPARE` decodes
  the source at the smallest scale its format offers that still covers the
  destination (`tairix_image::decode_fitted`, bounded by
  `MAX_WALLPAPER_DECODE_PIXELS`), so an 8.3-megapixel master bound for a
  1080p screen costs a quarter of its pixels rather than all of them, and
  a screen so large that no covering scale fits the bound is served from
  the largest scale that does rather than refused; it then computes its
  placement (`tairix_wallpaper::place`), holding the decoded source and its
  placement in the worker; `OP_WALLPAPER_BAND` draws and returns exactly
  the destination rows asked for; `OP_WALLPAPER_RELEASE` drops the held
  source. Bands exist purely to respect `MAX_FRAME`, never to raise it: a
  screenful of straight-alpha RGBA8 already exceeds it above 1080p, and
  `OP_WALLPAPER_PREPARE`'s reply names the row count a single
  `OP_WALLPAPER_BAND` reply can carry. The destination is bounded by
  `MAX_DESTINATION_WIDTH`×`MAX_DESTINATION_HEIGHT` (4K) on both sides of
  the seam — one bound for every destination this service draws, since a
  wallpaper models a screen and a viewer's picture area sits inside a
  window on one — and the source byte length by
  `tairix_wallpaper::MAX_WALLPAPER_BYTES`. The source itself arrives
  through the shared document upload below rather than inside the prepare
  request, so the wallpaper bound and the frame bound cannot collide.
  A tiled fit repeats the source at 1:1; every other fit resamples the
  placement's source rectangle into its destination rectangle through the
  same shared resampler the icon path uses. Wherever the placement does
  not cover the destination (a letterboxed fit, a source smaller than the
  screen), those pixels are left fully transparent — this service never
  draws the desktop's backdrop colour, only the wallpaper. The
  parent-side `render_wallpaper` drives the whole prepare/band/release
  sequence, validates every band's echoed geometry and exact pixel length
  fail-closed before trusting it, assembles the final buffer, and always
  releases the held source afterwards, on the success path and every
  error path alike, so a worker never holds a decoded wallpaper past one
  call. A later prepare on the same (reused) worker replaces whatever an
  earlier one left held; `OP_RASTERISE` keeps working unchanged whether or
  not it is interleaved with a wallpaper sequence on the same worker.
- **Handing over a file** (also `imagerender`): every untrusted file this
  service is given arrives one way — `OP_DOC_BEGIN` declares its length
  and the worker reserves it fallibly, then `OP_DOC_PUSH` carries it in
  pieces of at most `MAX_DOCUMENT_CHUNK`, which is derived from `MAX_FRAME`
  rather than chosen. There is deliberately no second way: a request
  carrying a whole file inline is bounded by what one frame holds, and a
  source ceiling set anywhere else can sit just above that, so every
  request at that size is refused by the transport rather than served.
  Streaming also means a caller reading a file need never hold it whole,
  and a fresh `OP_DOC_BEGIN` drops whatever session stood over the old
  document, since neither describes the new one. The total held is bounded
  by `MAX_DOCUMENT_BYTES` — a containment bound on what one worker holds
  resident, which is what an untrusted file costs before a pixel of it is
  decoded.
- **Document viewing** (also `imagerender`, the same worker): a picture or
  document the user opened is sniffed, decoded, and drawn inside the
  worker across four ops over an uploaded document. `OP_VIEW_OPEN`
  validates its structure and answers what it declares — format, entry
  count, whether the entries are frames to play or pages to choose
  between, any loop count, and the picture the container as a whole is —
  decoding no pixels; a caller may *name* the format instead of having it
  sniffed, which is the only door to a RISC OS sprite area, and the named
  format's own parser still validates the bytes so naming the wrong one is
  refused rather than misread. `OP_VIEW_PAGE` decodes one entry and the
  worker holds it; `OP_VIEW_RENDER` fixes which *rectangle* of that held
  page is drawn onto which destination extent; `OP_VIEW_BAND` returns
  exactly the destination rows asked for; `OP_VIEW_RELEASE` drops the
  document and everything decoded from it.
  Two properties follow from that shape. A zoomed-in viewer sends the crop
  it is showing, so the work and the reply are bounded by the window
  rather than by the picture — panning a hundred-megapixel page costs what
  panning a small one does. And the decoded page stays in the worker
  between requests, so panning and zooming re-draw rather than re-decode;
  the walk owns the document for the same reason, since an animation's
  frames composite onto their predecessors and a walk rebuilt per request
  would re-composite every frame before the one asked for. Changing page
  drops the render, because a rectangle of the page being replaced
  describes nothing of its replacement. Pages are decoded under
  `MAX_VIEW_DECODE_PIXELS`, set by what a viewer must be able to *open*
  (above the top of the current camera range) rather than by what a
  particular machine can afford — what a small machine can hold is
  enforced by the decode allocating fallibly and answering a typed
  refusal, not by a ceiling a larger machine would outgrow.
  The parent side (`open_view`, `select_page`, `render_page`,
  `close_view`) validates every reply fail-closed exactly as the wallpaper
  path does: an echoed page index, an echoed band range, an exact pixel
  length, a format byte the protocol carries, a flag byte that is a flag,
  and a page container that declares no loop count. A refusal is typed and
  says something a viewer can draw — the file is not a format it knows,
  its structure will not read, the picture is larger than a view opens, or
  it will not fit in memory — so a document that cannot be shown produces
  a stated reason rather than a blank window. Those last two are told
  apart deliberately: a user can act on "too large", and calling it a
  decode failure would say their photograph is broken when it is only
  big.
  The viewer's *own* rotation and flip are deliberately not here: they are
  a permutation of pixels the caller already holds and has validated, not
  a decode, so they belong to whatever holds the picture — turning what is
  displayed costs a window, turning what was decoded costs the whole page.
  What the worker does apply is the orientation a file itself declares,
  because reading that is part of reading the file.

- **NTP response evaluation** (`timesync`): a network time server's reply
  is evaluated inside the worker (`tairix_net::ntp::evaluate`) because the
  `timed` service that acts on the verdict holds `CAP_TIME_SET`, and
  setting the machine clock arbitrarily can invalidate certificate
  lifetimes, reorder how a reader interprets the audit log, and move
  capability expiry (`plans/TIMESYNC.md` §4). This consumer is unusual in
  that the caller keeps a check of its own *ahead* of the worker: the
  reply's origin timestamp must echo the request's CSPRNG nonce, read from
  a fixed offset in a fixed-length header, so a spoofed flood is dropped
  without a worker round trip rather than becoming a denial of service
  against the real reply. Only the fixed `PACKET_LEN` header crosses the
  seam. The parent-side `evaluate_datagram` then re-validates any returned
  sample against the plausibility window, the round-trip ceiling, and the
  usable stratum range before it can reach the clock, and the engine's
  transaction machine is driven from the *verdict* (`NtpClient::on_reply`)
  so the retry, rotation, and Kiss-o'-Death discipline has one
  implementation whether or not the decode was sandboxed.

Host tests inject the in-process `loopback` fake exactly as the
`Fs`/`Tty` seams take fakes, so a consumer's full parent-side path runs
under plain `cargo test`.

## What this deliberately is not

- It is not a general jail configuration surface: there is exactly one
  sandbox shape, so review is over one list, not a policy language.
- It is not seccomp-style per-process filter state: the brand is a
  single kernel-side bit on the task's capability record, checked at
  the one existing dispatch checkpoint — no per-syscall filter tables,
  no new hot-path cost for non-sandboxed tasks beyond one boolean read.
- It adds no syscall and no privileged path: the flag rides the
  existing attach block and only ever narrows.

## Test coverage

- `lib/abi`: sandbox block round-trip; refusal of every ambient shape
  (inherit-form wires, uid switch, console index) and of reserved flag
  bits.
- `kernel/sec`: `as_sandboxed` strips all three sets; `delegate` and
  `apply_token` refuse a sandboxed target (empty payload included), and
  the refusals are audited.
- `kernel/syscall`: the allow-list is frozen exactly; an exhaustive walk
  of the whole `abi-v1` table proves every non-listed syscall is refused
  for a sandboxed caller before its handler runs, with the denial
  audited.
- `kernel/core`: an end-to-end spawn with a sandbox attach block admits
  a child whose record is sandboxed and empty despite a manifest that
  requests a capability, with every standard stream closed.
- `lib/sandbox`: framing round-trips and truncation/oversize refusals;
  serve-loop semantics; containment (typed error, reap, replacement,
  logged events, frozen event ids); fail-closed decode of hostile
  replies; the `helpdoc` render-op whitelist (forbidden escapes, OSC
  strings, colour SGRs, and truncated trailing escapes all refuse the
  whole reply) and typed `HelpError` round-trips; the `imagerender`
  icon service (an SVG icon rasterises to an exact uniform colour, a PNG
  icon downscales through the shared resampler to a hand-checked known
  average, aspect-fit letterboxing centres with transparent padding,
  every refusal shape, and a hostile reply's wrong tag/echoed side/pixel
  length/trailing bytes each refuse fail-closed); the `imagerender`
  wallpaper service (a round trip for each of the five fits with exact
  corner/centre pixels, a tiled repeat verified across a whole grid, a
  4K destination that must band across several replies assembling
  byte-identical to a uniform-colour reference, a band before a prepare,
  a band out of range, a zero-row band, an oversize destination, an
  oversize source, a malformed image, an unrecognised format, release
  fail-closing a subsequent band, and `OP_RASTERISE` still round-tripping
  after a wallpaper sequence on the same worker); the supervised session
  (generations, paced replacement and its reset after a stable window,
  a clean end of stream counted as a failure, condemnation, and each
  failure logged exactly once); and the `fuzz_sandbox` harness (hostile
  input files through the decode, helpdoc, and imagerender icon/wallpaper
  request decoders, hostile worker replies into every client decoder) in
  `cargo xtask fuzz`. `fuzz_discoveryd` drives a supervised session
  against a hostile worker.
- `userland/apps/man`: the loopback-driven suite runs the real
  `HelpService` end to end, and hostile-renderer tests prove a
  disbelieved reply withholds the page (typed `ManError::Render`, no
  byte reaches the console) while `-h` degrades to the usage banner.
- QEMU (`tests/integration/sandbox_program` + `sandbox_qemu_aarch64`):
  the whole seam over the real syscalls on the `virt` board — decode of
  valid and malformed inputs through a genuinely sandboxed worker, real
  crash containment with a surviving caller, the syscall wall probed
  from inside a live sandbox (`fs_open`/`spawn` denied while the pipe
  reply crosses), and a supervised session whose stream worker is killed
  by a crafted frame and replaced only once its paced delay has elapsed
  on a real one-shot wait, the replacement serving on fresh descriptors.
