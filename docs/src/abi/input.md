# Input events (`abi-v1`)

The desktop is driven by pointer and keyboard input. A device's reports
reach the user-space desktop as a stream of framed records over a
capability-checked kernel input channel; the contracts of those records
live in `lib/abi/src/input.rs` (`tairix_abi::input`).

## The record

[`PointerInput`] is one decoded pointer event. The type makes illegal
states unrepresentable (`AGENTS.md` §2.11):

- `MovedBy { dx, dy }` — the pointer moved by a relative displacement in
  the device's count units (`evdev` orientation: positive x rightward,
  positive y downward).
- `Pressed(button)` / `Released(button)` — a [`PointerButtonCode`]
  (primary / secondary / middle) went down or came up at the current
  pointer position.
- `Scrolled { dx, dy }` — the scroll wheel turned by a relative number of
  detents (the pointer's orientation: positive x toward the logical end,
  positive y a detent toward the user, scrolling downward), acting at the
  current pointer position. The seat owner turns detents into the scroll units
  (`SCROLL_UNITS_PER_DETENT` a detent, accelerated by how fast the wheel turns)
  an application's `WindowEvent::Scrolled` carries.

The record is deliberately **screen-independent**: only the seat owner
(the desktop session, which owns the compositor) knows the screen's pixel
extent, so *it* accumulates displacements into the absolute, clamped
on-screen position — an input driver needs no display-geometry authority.

A record is exactly [`PointerInput::WIRE_LEN`] (20) bytes, little-endian:
a `"PIN1"` magic, the two-byte ABI version, a `kind` code, a `button`
code, a reserved half-word, and two 4-byte signed displacements. The
displacement fields carry the reported motion for a move, the signed wheel
detents for a scroll, and are zero for a press or release (a pointing device
reports motion separately from clicks, and the seat owner applies a button at
the position its accumulated motion established — the same model as
`lib/input`).

## Fail-closed decoding

[`PointerInput::from_bytes`] validates every field before returning a
value and refuses anything inconsistent rather than guessing
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §19.5): a short buffer, a wrong magic, an
unsupported version, a non-zero reserved field, an undefined `kind`, a
`button` code inconsistent with the kind (a button on a move, or no /
unknown button on a press), or a displacement on a press/release all fail
with the matching [`Errno`]. The decoder is enrolled in the `lib/abi`
fuzz harness (`AGENTS.md` §19.6).

## Relationship to the driver input ABI

This is **not** a duplicate of the device-level
[`driver::input::InputEvent`] (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). That type is what an
input *driver* reports across the [`Input`] driver trait: single-axis
pointer *deltas*, scroll ticks, and platform keycodes, one event per axis
or edge. `PointerInput` is the *seat-channel* record a driver process
injects (`pointer_inject`): button keycodes are resolved to the closed
button set, and a scroll wheel becomes a `Scrolled` tick record now that
the desktop scrollbar consumes it. [`PointerInput::from_device_event`] is
the one shared spelling of that mapping, so the virtio and USB HID driver
processes can never diverge.

## The keyboard record

[`KeyInput`] is the desktop-level counterpart of `PointerInput`: a key
going down or coming up, the [`KeyValue`] it produced — a Unicode
character (`Char`) or a named
non-character key ([`NamedKeyCode`]: Enter, the arrows, F1–F12, …) — and
the [`Modifiers`] (shift / ctrl / alt / meta) held at the time. As with
the pointer, this is the *resolved* event, not the device report:
turning raw keycodes and a keyboard layout into a produced character is
policy above the driver, not a second copy of the data (`AGENTS.md`
§2.2).

A third kind names no key at all: `ModifiersChanged` reports that the set
of held modifiers changed. A modifier produces no character and is no
`NamedKeyCode`, so it can never be typed into a text sink — but it still
has to be *reported*, because a consumer that only ever sees keys cannot
know a modifier is held when something other than a key arrives, a
pointer press most of all. The keyboard drivers emit one per *observable*
change: a key repeat, or letting go of one shift key while the other is
still held, produces nothing.

A record is exactly [`KeyInput::WIRE_LEN`] (20) bytes, little-endian: a
`"KIN1"` magic, the ABI version, a `kind` code (pressed / released /
modifiers-changed), the modifier bitmask, a `key_class` (char / named), a
4-byte codepoint, a 2-byte named-key code, and a reserved half-word.
Exactly one of the two key fields is set for a given class, and a
modifiers-changed record carries an all-zero key field — its one legal
spelling, so a dirty field is refused rather than read as a NUL character.
[`KeyInput::from_bytes`] validates every field — magic, version, reserved,
`kind`, `key_class`, the modifier bits, the named-key code, and that the
codepoint is a real Unicode scalar (an unpaired surrogate is refused) — and
fails closed with the matching [`Errno`] (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 / §19.5). It too
is enrolled in the `lib/abi` fuzz harness (`AGENTS.md` §19.6).

## Where it is consumed

The desktop session backs its
[`InputSource`](../desktop/session.md) seam with two decoders that share
the same `lib/input` `InputEvent` stream: `DeviceInputSource` reads
`PointerInput` records from the kernel pointer channel, and
`KeyboardInputSource` reads `KeyInput` records from the kernel keyboard
channel. The window manager delivers a decoded key event to the
focused window; the taskbar takes no keyboard input.

A `ModifiersChanged` record decodes to `InputEvent::ModifiersChanged` and
always reaches the window-manager router, whatever the pointer is over: it
is seat state, not a key any surface receives. The router keeps the current
set and the session stamps it onto every `WindowEvent::Pointer` it delivers,
so an application can qualify a click by a modifier (a shift-click) without
shadowing state it could never see. In *text* focus the kernel arbiter types
nothing for it — the shared `lib/keymap` encoder yields no bytes — so a held
modifier never reaches a console as input.
