# Driver traits (`abi-v1`)

This page is the long-form ABI reference for the trait surface in
`lib/abi/src/driver/`. Source-level rustdoc is the authoritative
specification; this page is a guided index.

The driver framework's narrative documentation (lifecycle,
capability model, kinds) lives in
[Driver framework overview](../drivers/overview.md).

## Shared types

### DriverHost

`trait DriverHost` — the host-supplied environment passed to a
driver's `register` entry point.

| Method                              | Capability gate                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `has_capability(cap)`               | None (pure query of load-time grant). |
| `kind()`                            | None.                                 |
| `virtio_host()`                     | None (host enforces `CAP_MEM_DMA` per alloc). |
| `mmio_mapper()`                     | None (mapper enforces `CAP_MMIO_MAP` per map). |
| `dma_host()`                        | None (host enforces `CAP_MEM_DMA` per alloc). |
| `mailbox()`                         | None (host enforces the doorbell/buffer gate). |
| `emit_node(node)`                   | None at the call site (host gates tree mutation). |

The trait deliberately exposes only what the driver needs to learn
about its own load-time grant and to reach the host facilities its
matched node was granted. Audit, logging, and IPC channels live in the
userland driver host. Every accessor that returns `Option`/`Result`
reports an *absent* facility as `None` / `DriverError::Unsupported` and
never as a synthesised handle, so a bus driver fails closed when a
facility it needs is not wired (`AGENTS.md` §18.4 / §5.4).

`dma_host(&self) -> Option<&dyn DmaHost>` is the **bus-neutral**
DMA-allocation accessor, a sibling of `mmio_mapper()`. A non-virtio bus
driver — e.g. the floor xHCI bring-up staging device-context and ring
memory — allocates a `DmaSlab` through it without reaching through the
virtio-shaped `VirtioHost`. The allocation contract lives once in
`trait DmaHost { fn alloc_dma_zeroed(&self, size) -> Result<DmaSlab,
DriverError>; fn device_quiesced(&self); }`; `VirtioHost: DmaHost` extends
it, so a virtio host is also a DMA host and the contract is never duplicated
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). A driver calls `device_quiesced` once its bring-up has
confirmed the device can no longer reach memory an earlier instance gave it
(a completed reset, a stopped engine); the user-space host forwards it to the
`dma_quiesced` syscall, which releases that memory from the kernel's DMA
quarantine, and an in-kernel host or a test double has nothing to release.
It is best effort: a refused or missing declaration only leaves the memory
held.

A driver frees DMA memory only once its device can no longer reach it. Every
device type that owns DMA memory, when it is dropped — whatever path drops
it, a serve loop's early return included — either stops or resets its device,
or, where nothing short of a reset could prove the memory released (an EMMC2
controller that never confirmed its line reset, a firmware mailbox still owed
a reply), withholds it: `DmaSlab::withhold` makes the slab's drop free
nothing, so the region stays mapped until the driver exits and the kernel
quarantines it. A request a device leaves unanswered is failed
to its caller, but the buffers it named stay the device's until the device
hands them back; a request queue carrying one request at a time
(`tairix_virtio::RequestQueue`) publishes nothing over them until then.

`mailbox(&self) -> Option<&dyn MailboxChannel>` is the board-neutral
firmware property-mailbox seam. A bus driver whose bring-up needs the
platform firmware (the BCM2711 VideoCore reload of the VL805 USB
controller firmware) marshals 32-word property messages
(`MAILBOX_PROPERTY_WORDS`) through it; the doorbell window, the
DMA-backed property buffer, and the bus-address translation stay behind
the host and the device's own `lib/vcmailbox` crate (`AGENTS.md` §2.20),
so the generic framework above it never names a board.

`emit_node(&self, node: HwNode) -> Result<(), DriverError>` lets a bus
driver publish a *discovered child* node into the hardware tree
(`AGENTS.md` §18.1): the enumerated device, carrying the `HwResource`
grant **requests** (register window + DMA region) the matched downstream
driver will receive. The §18.3 match/autoload path then sees a bindable
node like any other discovered device, and the driver requests only what
its enumeration found — no ambient authority (`AGENTS.md` §4).

For a **user-space** bus driver this is no longer a no-op default: the
rt-backed host `tairix_drvrt::RtDriverHost` forwards `emit_node` to the
`hw_emit_node` syscall (no. 37, gated on `CAP_HW_EMIT`). The kernel admits
the published node only when every `HwResource` it requests is covered by
one of the calling driver's own minted grants (`HwResource::covers`), so an
emitted child can never carry more authority than its emitter — the security
spine of recursive, user-space discovery (`AGENTS.md` §4 / §18.3, see
[Syscalls](../architecture/syscalls.md)). The kernel also **owns the node's
identity**: a driver leaves the node's `id`/`parent` unassigned, and on
publish the kernel assigns an id no node has held before in this boot and
sets the parent to the emitter's own matched node (resolved kernel-side from
the calling task), so a driver can neither forge its tree position nor collide
with a node id, and an id names one device for the whole boot (`AGENTS.md` §4
/ §5.4 — identity is kernel-provided, never caller-supplied). A task with no matched node may publish nothing. A refused
publish surfaces as `DriverError::PermissionDenied`; the in-kernel floor host
still attaches the node to the boot tree directly.

These four facility accessors are `abi-v1` *internal* additions: like
`virtio_host()` before them, each carries a default body so every
existing host impl stays source-compatible, and the public `register`
entry point is unchanged. They are the host surface the **autoloaded
user-space bus-driver chain** consumes (see below).

#### The recursive user-space bus-driver chain

The Pi 4 USB-keyboard path is **not** a bootstrap-floor driver. The §18.6
floor is storage-only (virtio-blk + EMMC2 — the path that must be up before
`/System/Drivers/` is readable); a PCIe/USB/HID stack sits *above* the floor
and so is discovered and autoloaded into user space (`AGENTS.md` §18.5), each
link its own signed `/System/Drivers/` bundle. There is no compiled-in
in-kernel scaffold (the former one was deleted at `plans/PI.md` P10 D5d).

The chain is sequenced not by a kernel catalogue but by the hardware tree
itself: each driver `register()`s reactively against the node the previous
driver published, and grows the tree with `emit_node()` so the next driver
autoloads. It is split across **four** autoloaded crates, each strictly its
own device, with no driver naming another (`AGENTS.md` §8 / §17.4 / §2.22),
all talking to the kernel solely through this `DriverHost` contract (no
`kernel/*` dependency — `AGENTS.md` §17.4) and consuming `mmio_mapper()`
(map the discovered register window), `dma_host()` (stage controller DMA),
`mailbox()` (firmware reload), and `emit_node()` (publish the enumerated
child), each free of ambient authority:

* **`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm`** binds the `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` node, trains the
  link, enumerates the VL805, assigns its BAR, and emits the VL805 PCI node.
  The BCM2711 bring-up logic is co-located **in that driver crate** (a
  host-testable `lib` target), not a `lib/*` device-support crate, since it
  has no charter-legal non-driver consumer (`AGENTS.md` §2.22).
* **`drivers/bus/mailbox/vcmailbox`** serves the `VideoCore` mailbox; the
  property-message layout lives in the genuinely-shared `lib/vcmailbox`
  (its other consumer is the aarch64 framebuffer boot console, so it stays
  in `lib/*` — `AGENTS.md` §2.22).
* **`drivers/bus/usb/vl805`** binds the VL805 PCI node, reloads its firmware
  over `mailbox()`, and emits the `usb,xhci` controller node forwarding the
  BAR + DMA grants. The VL805 firmware policy is co-located in that driver
  crate's `lib` target (`AGENTS.md` §2.22); the board-neutral xHCI protocol
  it builds on is the shared `lib/usb` / `drivers/bus/usb/xhci`.
* **`drivers/bus/usb/xhci`** binds the `usb,xhci` node, brings the
  controller up, enumerates its devices, and publishes one node per
  interface; **`drivers/input/usb_hid`** serves each HID interface.

The board-specific PCIe half is `tairix_drv_bus_pcie_brcm::wiring`: it reads
the controller register window + the inbound/outbound address windows off the
discovered `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` `HwNode` (`pcie_bringup_from_resources`, never
a compiled-in board constant — `AGENTS.md` §18.1), maps the window
(`mmio_mapper()`), trains the link, and `emit_node()`s the VL805 PCI node,
failing closed (`DriverError::NotFound`) on an incomplete node. QEMU models no
Pi PCIe link timing, so its host tests (in the driver crate's `lib` target)
prove the composition up to the root-port / link-up check; the live link
training is the on-metal acceptance item.

The board-neutral USB half is the landed
`tairix_drv_bus_usb::wiring::bring_up_boot_input`: it maps the controller
BAR (`mmio_mapper()`), carves the device-shared DMA region (`dma_host()`
— a USB host controller is not virtio, so it uses the bus-neutral DMA
seam, not `virtio_host()`), brings the controller up, enumerates the boot
device, augments the enumerated HID `HwNode` with its xHCI-BAR
(`HwResource::mmio`) and DMA (`HwResource::dma`) grant *requests* — exactly
what the matched user-space host-controller driver receives, no more
(`AGENTS.md` §4) — and `emit_node()`s it. QEMU models no Pi USB
controller, so its host tests prove the composition and its fail-closed
paths up to the controller hand-off; the live enumerate→emit path is the
on-metal acceptance item.

`virtio_host(&self) -> Option<&dyn VirtioHost>` is an `abi-v1`
*internal* extension added at Stage 4.D Item 0-tail. A virtio-class
driver consults it from inside `register()` to obtain the
per-driver host minted by `HostConfig::virtio_host_factory` (see
[Userland driver host](../drivers/host.md#virtio-host-factory)); the
default impl returns `None`, which keeps every existing
non-virtio host source-compatible. The public `register(host:
&dyn DriverHost) -> Result<DriverHandle, DriverError>` entry point
per `AGENTS.md` §8 is unchanged: the accessor takes `&self` to
compose with the immutable driver-host loan, and `VirtioHost`'s
own methods use interior mutability for state. The owned
`DmaSlab`, `PoolId`, and `SlabFreeFn` types backing the trait now
live in `tairix_abi::driver::dma`; `drivers/bus/virtio`
re-exports them so existing import sites remain unchanged.

### DriverHandle

`#[repr(transparent)] struct DriverHandle(u64)`. Issued by the host
to every successfully-loaded driver. The all-zero value is reserved
(`DriverHandle::NONE`) and rejected by
`DriverHandle::from_raw`.

### DriverKind

`#[repr(u8)] enum DriverKind { UserSpace = 0, InKernel = 1 }`.
`InKernel` requires `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` in addition to the universal
`CAP_DRV_LOAD`.

### DriverError

`#[repr(i32)] #[non_exhaustive] enum DriverError`, one variant per failure
path the trait surface can produce. Numeric values are dense from 1, disjoint
from [`tairix_abi::Errno`](../lib/abi.md), and freeze on the first release;
use `DriverError::as_errno` when bridging into a syscall result.

Each *distinguishable* refusal carries its own value, so no consumer has to
infer which one was meant from the call site it came through. On the
filesystem surface that means a taken name is `AlreadyExists`, a populated
directory is `DirectoryNotEmpty`, and a move that would make a directory its
own descendant is `DirectoryCycle`; `Busy` is reserved for the retryable
transient it documents. The generated C view names every value
(`TAIRIX_DRIVER_ERROR_*`), and a table test pins the numbering dense so a new
variant cannot be dropped from it.

### DriverManifest

`#[repr(C)] struct DriverManifest`. The signed prefix of a driver
module's `rxe` manifest. Wire encoding mirrors
[`tairix_abi::ManifestHeader`](../lib/abi.md) so a single verifier
serves both surfaces. Encoded length is `DriverManifest::WIRE_LEN`
bytes; the signature byte range is the tail of that buffer
(`DriverManifest::signed_range()` returns everything *before* the
signature). The body that follows the header is the requested
capability list (`capability_count` little-endian `u16` ids) followed
by the driver's bind table (`bind_key_count`
[`DriverBindKey`](#driverbindkey) records) and then the opaque payload
(the program image for a `kind = UserSpace` driver, empty for an
in-kernel one). All three — capability list, bind table, *and* payload —
are covered by the signature, so a spawned driver's program is
authenticated and cannot be substituted after signing (`AGENTS.md` §8 /
§2.17).

`DriverManifest::from_bytes` rejects:

* short buffers (`DriverError::BufferTooSmall`),
* wrong magic (`DriverError::BadMagic`),
* unsupported ABI versions (`DriverError::AbiVersionUnsupported`),
* oversize capability or bind-key counts
  (`DriverError::LengthOutOfRange`),
* unknown `kind` byte (`DriverError::OutOfRange`).

### DriverBindKey

`#[repr(C)] struct DriverBindKey`. One entry of a driver manifest's
bind table (`AGENTS.md` §18.3): a hardware-tree
`tairix_abi::hwtree::HwMatchKey` plus the manifest-declared
bind `priority`. The device manager matches each hardware-tree node's
keys against every driver's bind table; when more than one driver
matches the same node, the higher matched `priority` binds, and an
unbroken tie is a packaging defect refused deterministically. Encoded
length is `DriverBindKey::WIRE_LEN` (80) bytes; a manifest may declare
at most `DRIVER_MANIFEST_MAX_BIND_KEYS` (16) entries — a validation
bound, not a capacity (`AGENTS.md` §24.4).

`DriverBindKey::from_bytes` rejects short buffers
(`DriverError::BufferTooSmall`), a non-zero reserved field
(`DriverError::BadMagic`), an unknown match-key kind
(`DriverError::OutOfRange`), and an out-of-bounds `compatible` length
(`DriverError::LengthOutOfRange`); `decode_bind_keys` is the single
shared decoder for the whole table.

### DriverRegisterReply

`#[repr(C)] struct DriverRegisterReply` (`driver::register`). The
outcome of a spawned driver process's `register()` entry, reported to
the driver host over IPC (`PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW): `status` is
`DRIVER_REGISTER_STATUS_OK` (0) or the `DriverError::as_i32` code the
driver reported, and `handle` carries the driver-reported handle's raw
value exactly when `status` is OK. Encoded length is
`DriverRegisterReply::WIRE_LEN` (24) bytes. The record is
informational only — the host mints its own unforgeable
[`DriverHandle`](#driverhandle) on success, so a forged reply widens no
authority.

`DriverRegisterReply::from_bytes` rejects short buffers, wrong magic /
non-zero reserved words, unsupported ABI versions, unknown `status`
codes, and a `status`/`handle` pair that is inconsistent (a success
with the zero sentinel handle, or a failure carrying a handle) — the
whole record is refused on any failure (fail closed). The spawned
driver builds the record with `registered(handle)` / `failed(error)`
and sends it with the `tairix-rt` `ipc_send` wrapper to the reply
endpoint id its host handed it through its startup arguments
(`tairix_rt::arg`).

## Display

`trait Display`. Methods:

| Method               | Returns                            | Capability gate                       |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `mode_info()`        | `Result<DisplayMode, DriverError>` | Driver handle.                        |
| `device_report()`    | `DisplayDeviceReport`              | Driver handle.                        |
| `present(&)`         | `Result<(), DriverError>`          | Driver handle.                        |
| `present_rects(&, &)` | `Result<(), DriverError>`         | Driver handle.                        |
| `set_power(power)`   | `Result<(), DriverError>`          | Driver handle.                        |

`DisplayMode` carries `width_px`, `height_px`, `stride_bytes`, and
a `DisplayFormat` (`Rgba8888` or `Bgra8888`). `set_power` takes a
`DisplayPower` (`On` or `Off`); its default refuses `Unsupported`, the answer
for a display with no power control of its own.

## Filesystem

`trait Filesystem`. Methods:

| Method         | Capability gate                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `mount(src, flags)` | `CAP_FS_MOUNT` (plus driver handle).            |
| `unmount()`         | `CAP_FS_MOUNT` (plus driver handle).            |

`MountFlags` is a checked bitmap of `READ_ONLY`, `NOSUID`, `NODEV`,
`NOEXEC`. The installer's secure default layout (`AGENTS.md` §11.3,
§16.3) sets `NOSUID | NODEV` on `/Users` and `/Apps` via this type.

`Filesystem` carries only mount/unmount and a `DriverHandle`, so it
cannot perform path I/O. The read surface the VFS uses to delegate
path resolution to a driver is therefore a **separate versioned
trait**, `FilesystemRead`, not an added method on the frozen one
(`AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9 — same discipline as the `PortIo8` split):

| Method                            | Capability gate                       |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `root()`                          | Driver handle.                        |
| `node_info(node)`                 | Driver handle.                        |
| `lookup(dir, name)`               | Driver handle.                        |
| `read_at(file, offset, &mut)`     | Driver handle.                        |
| `read_dir(dir, cursor, &mut name)` | Driver handle.                       |

The surface is allocation-free: a `NodeId` is an opaque,
implementation-minted token (`NodeId::NONE` is reserved), `NodeInfo`
reports `{ kind, size, allocated }` — `allocated` being the bytes of
on-disk storage the node's data really occupies, from the format's own
allocation tracking (ext4 `i_blocks`, a FAT cluster chain, ARXFS mapped
extents) — and `read_dir` writes the entry name into a caller-provided
buffer alongside a `DirEntry { node, info, name_len, next_cursor }`.
The entry carries the child's full `NodeInfo`, so a listing consumer
never re-resolves each child by path to learn its kind or sizes, and
`cursor` is an opaque resume token (`0` starts; each entry's
`next_cursor` continues the listing in O(1), the `getdents` `d_off`
model — a full listing is one bounded scan, never a quadratic rescan
per entry). A token is meaningful only for the unmodified directory
that produced it; any other value is handled safely (bounds-checked,
fail-closed).
Implementations expose raw structural access only and make **no**
permission decisions — the VFS authorises every traversal against the
§5.3 model before calling here (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). The first
implementation is the [FAT32 driver](../filesystem/fat32.md); the
read-only [ext4 driver](../filesystem/ext4.md) implements this trait
without `FilesystemWrite`.

The mutating surface is a second separate versioned trait,
`FilesystemWrite`, again additive rather than a widening of the frozen
`Filesystem` or of `FilesystemRead` (`AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9):

| Method                                | Capability gate                   |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `create(dir, name, kind)`             | Driver handle (writable mount).   |
| `write_at(dir, name, offset, data)`   | Driver handle (writable mount).   |
| `truncate(dir, name, size)`           | Driver handle (writable mount).   |
| `remove(dir, name)`                   | Driver handle (writable mount).   |
| `rename(src_dir, src_name, dst_dir, dst_name)` | Driver handle (writable mount). |
| `flush()`                             | Driver handle.                    |

Unlike the read surface, the mutating methods address their target as a
`(dir, name)` pair rather than by a `NodeId`: a `NodeId` is
self-describing but carries no back-pointer to the directory entry that
stores a file's length and starting location, and filesystems such as
FAT keep that metadata *in the parent directory*. As on the read side,
the driver makes no permission decision; the VFS authorises the write
against the §5.3 template (and refuses a write to a `READ_ONLY` mount)
before delegating (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). The first implementation is the
read/write [FAT32 driver](../filesystem/fat32.md).

A driver that stores full POSIX metadata *per inode* — owner, group,
mode bits, an ACL, and an optional capability gate (§5.3) — additionally
implements a third separate versioned trait, `FilesystemSecurity`, so
the VFS can use that **stored** record as the policy input instead of a
uniform mount-point template:

| Method            | Capability gate    |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `security(node)`  | Driver handle.     |

`security` returns a `NodeSecurity { mode, uid, gid, required_cap, acl }`
record, where `acl` is up to `MAX_ACL_ENTRIES` (eight) grant-only
`SecurityAcl { subject, perms }` entries (`subject` is a
`SecuritySubject::User | Group`, `perms` an `rwx` triad). Like the other
surfaces the driver only *reports* the record and makes no decision; the
VFS translates it into its policy metadata and applies the §5.3 model
(`AGENTS.md` §5.4). A driver such as FAT that keeps no per-file owner
simply does not implement this trait, and the VFS keeps applying the
mount-point template. The first implementation is the native
[`arxfs` driver](../filesystem/arxfs.md); the
[`ext4` driver](../filesystem/ext4.md) also implements it, reporting each
inode's stored mode and owner (its POSIX ACLs live in xattr blocks the
read surface does not yet decode, so it surfaces no `required_cap` and no
ACL entries).

A node's four §21 timestamps travel **in `NodeInfo`** — the `times:
NodeTimes { created, modified, accessed, changed }` field the read
surface fills in the *same* structural read as `kind`/`size`, so a caller
never pays a second inode read (nor a second on-disk walk) to learn a
node's times, and every `read_dir` entry carries them for free. Each
field is a 64-bit-native `Time64` (signed seconds plus nanoseconds), so
absolute time is never a seconds-only scalar and the full pre-1970 /
post-2038 range round-trips without truncation. A stamp the backing
format does not keep is `Time64::UNIX_EPOCH` (never a fabricated wall
time): the native [`arxfs` driver](../filesystem/arxfs.md) deliberately
does **not** track access time, so its `times.accessed` is always the
epoch, while [`ext4`](../filesystem/ext4.md) reports the real
`i_atime`/`i_ctime`/`i_mtime`/`i_crtime` its inodes store, and FAT — which
holds stamps only in the parent's directory record — reports them through
`read_dir` (a stat by node reports the epoch). There is no separate
`FilesystemTimestamps` trait: folding the times into `NodeInfo` removed
both it and the old separate `DirEntry.modified` stamp (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

Every mountable driver additionally implements a separate versioned
whole-volume statistics trait, `FilesystemStats`, alongside (never a
widening of) the others (`AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9):

| Method    | Capability gate    |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `stats()` | Driver handle.     |

`stats` returns a `VolumeStats { block_size, total_blocks, free_blocks,
avail_blocks, files, files_free }` record: whole blocks of the unit the
mounted format actually allocates in, with every count 64-bit
(`AGENTS.md` §26.6 — a volume may exceed what 32 bits hold).
`avail_blocks` is the portion of `free_blocks` an ordinary data
allocation may consume (a format that withholds a reserve — arxfs's
metadata reserve — reports the smaller number), so `avail_blocks ≤
free_blocks ≤ total_blocks` always holds and consumers are never
promised space the driver would refuse. `files`/`files_free` report a
fixed inode table's capacity; a format that allocates inodes dynamically
(arxfs) carries the honest `0`/`0` "untracked" pair, never a fabricated
total. The report is a read of the driver's own accounting, never a
device walk, and it feeds the mount snapshot the System Information
API's `MOUNT_LIST` rows carry (so `df` renders it without a `/proc`).
The first implementation is the native
[`arxfs` driver](../filesystem/arxfs.md).

## Block

`trait Block`. Methods:

| Method                  | Capability gate         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| `geometry()`            | Driver handle.          |
| `read_blocks(lba, &mut)`| Driver handle.          |
| `write_blocks(lba, &)`  | Driver handle.          |

Buffer sizes must be a positive integer multiple of
`geometry()?.block_size`; LBA ranges are bounds-checked against
`geometry()?.block_count`.

## Net

`trait Net`. Methods:

| Method                                  | Capability gate              |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `device_facts()`                        | Driver handle.               |
| `service(&mut rings)`                   | `CAP_NET_RAW` (plus handle). |
| `set_multicast_groups(&[MacAddress])`   | `CAP_NET_RAW` (plus handle). |
| `set_completion_interrupts(bool)`       | `CAP_NET_RAW` (plus handle). |
| `ack_interrupt()`                       | Driver handle.               |

Frame I/O is the shared-memory frame-ring transport
(`tairix_abi::driver::net_ring`): `service` drains the stack-owned TX
ring into the device and harvests delivered frames into the RX ring
(see [Network drivers](../drivers/network.md)).

`set_completion_interrupts` masks and unmasks the device's **data-path
completion** sources — receive-done and transmit-done — and is the half of a
poll-to-budget cycle that stops an interrupt storm: a DMA engine's status
latches a *level* condition, so `ack_interrupt` alone re-latches while frames
are undrained. Link and configuration-change sources stay live throughout, or
a cable pulled mid-flood would go unnoticed. The default is `Ok(())` for a
device with no maskable source (an in-process mock, a self-clearing
transport).

## Input

`trait Input`. One method:

| Method            | Capability gate    |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `poll(&mut)`      | Driver handle.     |

Event records are `InputEvent { kind, reserved0, code, value }`;
`InputEventKind` is `Key`, `Pointer`, or `Scroll`.

Legacy x86 input controllers are byte-addressed, so the
`tairix_abi::driver::port_io` module ships an 8-bit port-access seam,
`trait PortIo8 { read8, write8 }`, alongside the existing 32-bit
`PortIo` (which is reserved for PCI mechanism #1 configuration access).
`PortIo` is frozen, so per
`AGENTS.md` §2.4 the byte width is a separate versioned trait rather
than an added method. A driver names `PortIo8` without depending on an
architecture port; the x86_64 port supplies the only real
implementation (`AGENTS.md` §17.2 / §17.4). See
[Input drivers](../drivers/input.md).

Those two seams serve drivers the kernel hosts in-tree. A driver
autoloaded into **user space** reaches the port space through the
capability-gated `port_read` / `port_write` traps instead, which take an
unforgeable device-resource grant handle rather than a bare port number:
the kernel resolves it against the calling task, confirms it names a
`HwResourceKind::Port` range, and confirms the whole
`port .. port + width` transfer lies inside it before issuing anything.
Unbounded port I/O is privilege escalation — the ports a machine exposes
include the interrupt controller, the DMA controller, and the reset line
— so a driver addresses exactly the range its matched node requested and
nothing else (`AGENTS.md` §4, §5.4).

The traps are gated on `CAP_MMIO_MAP`, the authority a port resource
already requires, so no capability was added (`AGENTS.md` §5.2). The
transfer width is `PortWidth` (1, 2, or 4 bytes) and is validated, not
trusted: a wider access than the grant covers would reach a neighbouring
device's registers. A value crossing the boundary is narrowed to its
width once, into a `PortValue`, so the width and the value cannot
disagree below that point. Only the x86 family installs a producer;
every other port fails both traps closed with `NotImplemented`.

## Bus

`trait Bus`. One method:

| Method                | Capability gate     |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `enumerate(&mut)`     | Driver handle.      |

`BusDevice` carries `vendor`, `device`, `class`, and bus-local
`address`.

## Register access

A driver's register sequence is written over `RegisterBlock`: `read32`,
`write32` and `block_len`, all through `&self`, since an access changes the
device rather than the caller. The kernel-minted `RegisterWindow` implements
it on metal; a host test implements it over a register-level model that keeps
its state behind interior mutability.

## Virtio-PCI provisioning

`trait VirtioPciBus: Bus`. The boot-time PCI walk that turns a modern
virtio device's vendor-specific capabilities into kernel-mapped
register windows lives in ring 0, but ring 0 may not name a concrete
`drivers/bus/*` type (`AGENTS.md` §8). This trait is the frozen seam
that lets it call into the PCI driver through `&dyn VirtioPciBus`:

| Method                                       | Capability gate                       |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `map_virtio_window(bdf, cfg_type, mapper)`   | `CAP_MMIO_MAP` (enforced by `mapper`). |
| `notify_off_multiplier(bdf)`                 | Driver handle.                        |

The `VIRTIO_PCI_CFG_*` constants name the four `cfg_type` discriminants
(common `1`, notify `2`, ISR `3`, device `4`) the caller maps, and
`VIRTIO_PCI_VENDOR_ID` (`0x1AF4`) identifies a virtio function. The
kernel's `provision_virtio_pci` walk (see
[Bus drivers](../drivers/bus.md#ring-0-virtio-pci-walk)) enumerates
through the `Bus` supertrait, picks the matching function, maps the
four windows through the `CAP_MMIO_MAP`-gated `MmioMapper`, and hands
the assembled `PciTransportWindows` (a `lib/virtio` type) to a
caller-supplied builder — so it names neither the concrete `Pci` type
nor the `PciTransport` it produces.

## Virtio-MMIO provisioning

`trait VirtioMmioBus: Bus`. The `virt`-platform counterpart of
`VirtioPciBus`. A virtio-MMIO device is presented as a single
memory-mapped register block discovered from the flat device tree;
the boot-time walk that maps it lives in ring 0, which may not name a
concrete `drivers/bus/*` type (`AGENTS.md` §8). This frozen seam lets
it call into the MMIO bus driver through `&dyn VirtioMmioBus`:

| Method                          | Capability gate                       |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `map_slot_window(base, mapper)` | `CAP_MMIO_MAP` (enforced by `mapper`). |

Unlike the PCI transport's four capability-selected windows, the MMIO
transport consumes exactly one window over the register block at the
slot's `BusDevice::address`. The kernel's `provision_virtio_mmio` walk
(see [Bus drivers](../drivers/bus.md#ring-0-virtio-mmio-walk))
enumerates through the `Bus` supertrait, picks the slot whose
`DeviceID` matches, maps its window through the `CAP_MMIO_MAP`-gated
`MmioMapper`, and hands the window to a caller-supplied builder — so it
names neither the concrete `Mmio` type nor the `MmioTransport` it
produces.

## Generic-PCI provisioning

`trait PciBus: Bus`. A non-virtio, DMA-driving PCI device — the
Raspberry Pi 4's VL805 `PCIe` xHCI USB host controller — exposes its
registers as a whole BAR and needs no MSI-X, so it consumes a smaller
seam than `VirtioPciBus`. A device-class driver (`drivers/bus/usb`)
reaches the PCI driver through `&dyn PciBus`, never naming the concrete
`Pci` type (`AGENTS.md` §8 / §17.4):

| Method                                | Capability gate                        |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `map_bar_window(bdf, bar_index, mapper)` | `CAP_MMIO_MAP` (enforced by `mapper`). |
| `enable_bus_master(bdf)`              | Driver handle.                         |

`map_bar_window` resolves the memory BAR's probed base/length and maps
it through the `CAP_MMIO_MAP`-gated `MmioMapper` (refusing I/O-port and
unused BARs); `enable_bus_master` sets the function's Memory Space + Bus
Master Enable bits so the controller may issue upstream DMA. `Pci<C>`
implements it by forwarding to the inherent methods, sharing the
bus-master activation with `route_msix` (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). The xHCI
bring-up consumes it in `tairix_drv_bus_usb::wiring::open_discovered`
(see [Bus drivers](../drivers/bus.md#generic-pci-bar-hand-off-the-xhci--vl805-path)).

## Versioning

The driver trait surface is part of the frozen `abi-v1` contract.
Adding a method to any of the class traits, or adding a variant to
any of the `#[non_exhaustive]` enums above, is **not** an
in-place change — it requires a new versioned trait/enum under an
`abi-v2` module (`AGENTS.md` §2.4 / §9). `cargo xtask abi-check`
continues to be the cross-check authority for the syscall table; a
parallel guard for the driver surface lands with the userland
driver host change set.
