# PID 1 service manager (`userland/system/init`)

`tairix-init` is the first user-space process the kernel starts. It owns
the lifecycle of every long-running system service under
`/System/Services` (`AGENTS.md` §16.2): it brings them up in dependency
order, launches each one as its own **service account**, and reaps the
children that any PID 1 inherits. The **kernel** is the single authority
over a service's capabilities — it grants `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` from
the signed bundle at load time (`AGENTS.md` §5.2, §8); init names the binary
and the account, never a capability set.

The crate is `no_std` (with `alloc`), has no `unsafe`, and depends only on
the audited `lib/*` crates `tairix-abi`, `tairix-caps`, and `tairix-log`,
so a userland service never links a kernel or driver crate
(`AGENTS.md` §17.4). The installed binary lives at
`/System/Services/init`.

## The orchestrator, not a loader

`init` decides *what* runs, *in what order*, and *when*. It deliberately
does **not** verify a service binary's signature, syscall-table hash, or
`rxe` envelope, and it is **not** the capability authority: verifying the
binary and granting `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` are the loader/kernel's
job, the same pipeline [`drvhost`](../drivers/host.md) runs for drivers
(`AGENTS.md` §8). `init` names the binary and the service account and hands
both to the `Spawner` seam; the kernel derives and enforces the grant.

## Bring-up pipeline

`Init::start_all` runs the registered service set through a fixed pipeline
that **fails closed** (`AGENTS.md` §5.4.5):

1. **Order** the services by their declared dependencies (Kahn
   topological sort, ready services emitted in registration order so the
   result is deterministic — `AGENTS.md` §18.3).
2. **Reject the whole graph** — starting nothing — if it is structurally
   invalid: a dependency names an unregistered service
   (`DependencyMissing`) or the graph contains a cycle
   (`DependencyCycle`). The system never boots a partial, surprising
   configuration.
3. **Admit** each service whose prerequisites are met, in order: **spawn**
   it as its service account and **audit** the outcome. The kernel derives
   and enforces its capability grant from the signed bundle; init passes no
   capability set. Bring-up is an admission engine, not a single
   spawn-everything pass — see *Lifecycle and readiness* below.

When the graph is sound, init brings up every service whose prerequisites
can be met. A single service that fails — the kernel's load gate refuses
the spawn (a bad manifest, a capability beyond the account's ceiling, or
another load failure) — is recorded, and the
services that *transitively depend on it* are skipped; services
independent of the failure still start. Each admission pass returns a
`StartReport` (`started` + `failed`), so a caller can see what came up and
which optional services are absent without the boot aborting.

## Lifecycle and readiness (`NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-2)

A service manager that treats *spawned* as *up* cannot honestly start a
dependent that needs "the network is up" — the dependency may be running
but not yet functional. `init` therefore tracks each service through the
lifecycle `tairix_abi::ServiceState`
(`inactive → starting → ready → running → stopping → stopped | failed`)
and releases a dependent only once every dependency it names is
`ServiceState::is_ready` (`ready` or `running`), never merely spawned.

- **Readiness kind.** A service declares how it reaches readiness
  (`tairix_abi::ReadinessKind`, unit metadata read from its manifest). An
  `immediate` service (the default, the analogue of systemd `Type=simple`)
  is `ready` the instant its spawn succeeds; a `notify` service
  (`Type=notify`) stays `starting` until it announces itself up.
- **Readiness notification.** A `notify` service sends a
  `tairix_abi::ServiceNotice` — an `sd_notify` analogue carrying a
  `LifecycleSignal` (`ready` or `failed`) and **no identity**: the manager
  attributes the notice to the kernel-attested sender, never a
  caller-supplied name (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). `Init::notify_sender` is the
  transport's entry: it resolves the sender's attested process id and
  account to a service the manager is currently *starting*, then applies
  the notice — `ready` releases the service's dependents, `failed` marks it
  failed and skips the dependents blocked on it. It fails closed
  (`NotifyError`) on a sender that matches no starting service, or a notice
  for one that is not `starting`. The endpoint it arrives on is described
  under *On-demand activation* below.
- **Named readiness conditions.** A service may `require` and `provide`
  named conditions (`tairix_abi::ReadyCondition`: `network-up`,
  `filesystems-mounted`, `boot-complete`, `display-present`,
  `seat-available`). The manager admits a service only once every
  condition it requires is satisfied; a condition is satisfied when a
  providing service becomes ready or when the manager/kernel signals it
  through `Init::satisfy_condition`. Conditions decouple readiness from a
  service name — a client requires `network-up` without naming `netstack`.
  A provided condition holds only while a provider is ready, so a service
  requiring it runs only while it holds: when the last ready provider stops
  being ready — it exits, is killed as wedged, or is stopped — the condition
  is withdrawn (`CONDITION_WITHDRAWN`), and every live service requiring it,
  with what names it as a dependency, is stopped and **held**: its exit
  returns it to `inactive`, and it is admitted again once the condition next
  holds. A hold spends no restart budget. A condition asserted through
  `satisfy_condition` is never withdrawn. A stop or a shutdown is final: it
  cancels a pending restart, admission, or hold, so a stopped service comes
  back only when started by name.
  A condition is only ever satisfied by a principal that genuinely knows it:
  `netstack` provides `network-up` by announcing readiness once its endpoints
  are bound, which is what `discoveryd` requires, since its sockets live in
  the stack and a stack relaunch takes them with it. `display-present` has no
  truthful producer today (`seatmgr` and `devmgr` both reach ready on a
  headless machine), so nothing declares it. The
  headless guarantee for a GUI-only service does not rest on a condition
  anyway — it is `on-demand`, so a machine where nothing graphical runs never
  activates it (`AGENTS.md` §17.3).

Bring-up runs this as an admission fixpoint: it repeatedly admits every
service whose dependencies are ready and whose required conditions are
satisfied, and skips every service a failed dependency blocks, until
nothing changes. A chain of `immediate` services comes up in one pass; a
`notify` service pauses the chain until it announces readiness, and a
dependency that never reports ready simply leaves its dependents
`inactive` — fail closed, never a guess (`AGENTS.md` §5.4).

## Discovery and the enrolment registry (`NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-3)

Unlike a driver, a service has no natural activation gate — a driver's is
"the hardware is physically present and matched" (`AGENTS.md` §18.3), but
merely dropping a signed service bundle on disk must **not** make a live
service appear (that would be an ambient-authority-shaped risk). The
lifecycle is therefore split into three distinct steps (the systemd
*present-vs-enabled* split, given the capability framing):

1. **Discovery** — *what bundles exist*: a scan of `/System/Services/*.app`
   reading each signed `AppInfo`, reusing the same store walk drivers use
   (`AGENTS.md` §18.5/§18.6) — no compiled-in list of which services exist
   beyond the boot floor.
2. **Registration / enablement** — *is a discovered bundle eligible* to be
   brought up. This is an explicit, recorded decision in the **enrolment
   registry** (`lib/enrolment`, `tairix_enrolment`), never implied by
   presence.
3. **Activation** — actually starting an eligible service, through the
   bring-up engine above.

The enrolment registry is **two layers**, folded by
`tairix_enrolment::effective`:

| Layer | Type | Where | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vendor | `tairix_enrolment::Enrolment` | the `enrolled` directives of the startup configuration | the build |
| Administrator | `tairix_enrolment::EnrolmentOverride` | `/System/Settings/Services/overrides` on the encrypted root | PID 1, on a request |

The split is forced by the volume layout rather than chosen. The whole
`/System/Settings` subtree resolves to the writable encrypted root, so nothing
there is readable before the unlock — and PID 1 must know what to bring up
before then; while the pre-unlock volume is read-only, so nothing there can be
written at runtime. The vendor layer is therefore not a document: no file under
`/System` is reliably readable at the instant the manager decides, and the only
sanctioned pre-unlock read is the store service's `CAP_DRV_LOAD`-gated
whitelist, which PID 1 must not hold to read a configuration file. An on-disk
vendor record waits for the `/System/Services` discovery scan, which needs that
same read path. The administrator's layer holds only what *differs* from the
image's, so a system update shipping a different default reaches every service
the administrator has not spoken about. `tairix_enrolment::overrides_for` derives that document from the
desired effective set, so re-enabling something empties its entry rather than
pinning the old default. A **per-user** store lives under the user's own
`/Users/<u>/Settings/Services/` and parses identically.

PID 1 boots on the vendor layer alone and calls `Init::adopt_overrides` the
moment the administrator's document becomes readable — on a bounded doubling
one-shot ladder (`lib/util::retry`, shared with the clock service, which waits
the same way for the same reason), because no userland event says when the root
was unlocked — stopping anything it disables and recording
`SERVICE_ENROLMENT_REVOKED`. A disabled service therefore runs for the few
seconds before the unlock; nothing is *granted* by the document being
unreadable, so this is a narrowing that arrives late, not a fail-open.

- **The store holds only enrolment records — not unit metadata.** A
  service's restart policy, activation mode, linger, dependencies,
  readiness conditions, and rlimits live in its **signed `AppInfo`
  manifest** (`AGENTS.md` §16.5), so tampering is a load refusal rather
  than a silent behaviour change. The store records only the decision
  "this bundle is enabled", keyed to the bundle; duplicating unit metadata
  into a separately-writable store would be both the duplication
  `AGENTS.md` §2.2 forbids and a place authority could be raised.
- **`Init::register_enrolled` registers only enrolled bundles.** Given the
  discovered set (each parsed into a `ServiceSpec` by the loader seam) and
  the two enrolment layers, it registers a bundle for bring-up **only** if the
  effective enrolment enables it; a present-but-unenrolled bundle is never
  registered and its skip is audited (`SERVICE_NOT_ENROLLED`). Presence on
  disk grants no eligibility (`AGENTS.md` §4). Its spec is *retained* as known
  but unenrolled, which is what lets an administrator enable it later by name
  instead of the manager having forgotten it exists.
- **Fail closed.** The store text is untrusted input: parsing rejects a
  malformed name (a strict lowercase-`[a-z0-9._-]` bundle identifier, so a
  `..`- or path-traversal-shaped token can never be enrolled) or a
  duplicate, and the caller resolves both a **corrupt** and a **missing**
  store to the empty enrolment — nothing is eligible, never a guess
  (`AGENTS.md` §5.4, §2.9).
- **`enable` / `disable` never widen authority, and the boundary is
  identity.** `tairix_enrolment::enrol` and `tairix_enrolment::unenrol` are pure record
  transforms that return the new set for the caller to persist; `unenrol`
  fails closed if the service was not enrolled, so a control tool reports
  honestly that nothing changed. Authority is decided by three things that are
  *not* a capability computation in the engine: the kernel's
  `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` gate on the endpoint, the service being **known** to
  this manager (so a typo cannot record a phantom enrolment a later image would
  activate), and `AuthorityScope::permits_account` — the same identity boundary
  the launch path uses, which is what stops a per-user manager enrolling a
  system-authority service. Authority itself is unwidenable regardless: the
  kernel derives `manifest ∩ account-ceiling` from the signed bundle at start
  (below).

## Capability authority (`AGENTS.md` §5.2)

The **kernel** is the single authority over a service's capabilities. When
it loads the service binary it reads the signed bundle manifest and grants
the intersection of the manifest's request with the **service account's**
ceiling — the very model [`drvhost`](../drivers/host.md) uses for drivers
(`AGENTS.md` §8, §18.6). `init` names only the binary and the account uid;
it never decodes a manifest or computes a grant on the launch path, so no
second capability-derivation path can drift from the kernel's and there is
no ambient authority (`AGENTS.md` §4). A load the kernel refuses (a bad
manifest, or a request beyond the account's ceiling) surfaces to init as a
`SpawnFailed`, exactly like any other refused load.

init decodes **no** manifest anywhere, on the launch path or the enrolment
path. `tairix_enrolment::enrol` deliberately has no "requested ⊆ the
enroller's ceiling" refusal: every system service holds service-scoped
capabilities no human account's ceiling carries (`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` for
`timed`, `CAP_SYSINFO_INTROSPECT` for `sysinfod`, `CAP_DRV_LOAD` for
`devmgr`), so such a check would refuse an administrator enabling any of them,
and it would be the second capability-derivation path the scope model states
the engine must not grow.

## Authority scope (`NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-6)

TAIRiX runs **one policy engine at two authority scopes**, never two
codebases (`AGENTS.md` §2.2): the single **system** service manager (PID 1's
role) and one **per-user** manager instance per logged-in user, spawned by
the system manager at session start and delegated only that user's
authority. Each `Init` instance carries its `tairix_init::AuthorityScope`
(`System`, or `User { uid }`) — chosen once at construction and never
changed — and it is the fixed security boundary between the two roles.

Because a service is always launched **as a service account** (a uid) and
the kernel derives its grant from that account's ceiling (above), a manager
confined to one user can only be permitted to manage services that run **as
that user**. `Init::register` enforces this before it touches any state
(capability check before state, `AGENTS.md` §5.4): a `User { uid }` manager
registers a service only if the spec's account equals `uid`, and the system
manager permits any account. A spec naming a different account — a system
service account, or another user's uid — is refused (`ScopeViolation`) and
audited (`SERVICE_SCOPE_REJECTED`), so a per-user manager can neither raise
a service to system authority nor reach into another user's services
(`AGENTS.md` §4, §5.2). `register_enrolled` inherits the same check, so even
a positively-enrolled bundle whose account is out of scope fails closed
before any service starts.

This is deliberately an **identity** check on the account the spec already
names, not a capability computation: the engine never decodes a manifest or
derives a grant on the launch path, so there is no second
capability-derivation path to drift from the kernel's authoritative one (the
enrolment-ceiling check above is the only place init reads a manifest, and
it governs eligibility, not the grant).

## Control surface (`NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-8)

Beyond boot bring-up, a running service is driven through a
capability-gated **control surface** — the `systemctl` analogue. Its wire
contract is the reserved synchronous call endpoint
`tairix_abi::service_control::SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT` (a fixed-size,
bounds-checked `ServiceControlRequest` — a `ServiceControlOp` (`start` /
`stop`) plus a bounded, UTF-8-validated service name — and a status-framed
reply carrying the resulting `ServiceState`). Persistent enablement
(`enable`/`disable`, which mutates the enrolment registry) and observability
(`status`, served through the System Information API, `AGENTS.md` §16.6) are
separate concerns and are **not** carried on this endpoint.

The engine side is `Init::control`, which dispatches a decoded request to
`Init::start_service` (`start`) or `Init::stop` (`stop`). **Authorization is
the endpoint's, not the dispatch's** (`AGENTS.md` §5.2): the kernel gates
*reaching* a manager's control endpoint on the send capability the manager
binds it with, so the receiver does not re-check a caller capability — it
validates the request against the strict service-name policy
(`tairix_enrolment::validate_service_name`, so a path-traversal- or
case-collision-shaped name never matches a service) and applies it, failing
closed and auditing every refusal (`ControlError`):

- `start` brings a down (`inactive`/`stopped`/terminally `failed`) service
  up now, exactly like a boot admission — spawned as its own account,
  marked ready if `immediate`, its order-dependents released — but **only**
  when every readiness condition it requires is satisfied, so a
  `display-present`-gated GUI service fails closed on a headless system
  (`ControlError::Unavailable`) rather than being guessed into life
  (`AGENTS.md` §17.3). It is idempotent for a service already coming up or
  up (returns the current state, no respawn), cancels a pending restart
  backoff first (an explicit start supersedes a queued relaunch), and
  reports a kernel-refused spawn as `ControlError::NotStartable`.
- `stop` tears the service and its transitive dependents down gracefully in
  reverse-dependency order (reusing `Init::stop`; a stop is never fought
  with a relaunch).

An unknown or policy-invalid name fails closed as
`ControlError::UnknownService`.

**The transport is live.** PID 1 binds the endpoint restricted-sender
requiring `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` and serves it from its single park, and
[`servicectl`](./servicectl.md) is the first holder. There is no second
dispatch loop: the session supervisor's blocking wait-on-children became a
wait-set park carrying the control endpoint, any-child readiness, and a
timeout folded from the engine's own `Init::next_deadline`, so a control
request is answered while the login session sits blocked on its console and an
idle machine takes no timer interrupt. When the park lapses,
`Init::expire_due` runs every deadline that is now due — one park can find
several — and guarantees each is afterwards consumed or dropped, which is what
makes the derived park length safe rather than a zero-length spin.

`Enable`/`Disable` and `Status` are deliberately **not** on this endpoint:
enablement mutates the registration store and status is served through the
System Information API, never a control-reply scrape.

## On-demand activation and its two endpoints (`NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-5)

A shared service that only a graphical session ever needs — `fontd` today —
is registered but not started. A client reaches it by asking the manager to
connect it, over the reserved `SERVICE_ACTIVATION_ENDPOINT`
(`ServiceActivationRequest`: `connect` or `disconnect`, plus the bounded
service name). The manager checks the service's declared connect capability
against the caller's **kernel-attested** authority before it touches any
state, starts the service if it is down, and parks the caller until it is
ready. A parked caller blocks in the kernel on its own `ipc_call`: the
manager holds the call's *ticket* and replies to it when the engine reports
the park resolved, so there is no poll and no retry anywhere on the path.

Every park resolves exactly once, and both ways resolve through the same
report (`Init::take_released_clients`). A service that reaches readiness
connects its parked clients; a service whose process dies first, announces
its own failure, or whose client withdraws, **abandons** them — and the
transport refuses each abandoned caller rather than leaving it blocked on a
service that is not coming.

The endpoint carries **no** send capability, deliberately. Any principal may
*ask* for a shared service; what decides the answer is the per-service
connect capability the engine checks against the caller's attested authority.
Restricting the endpoint instead would put every service behind one
capability and make the per-service gate unreachable.

Readiness is the service's own announcement, over the reserved
`SERVICE_NOTICE_ENDPOINT`. The frame is a `ServiceNotice` and it **names no
service**: the manager resolves one from the call's kernel-attested origin —
the process id it recorded when it spawned the service, and the account the
kernel switched that process onto — and only while that service is still
`starting`. So a principal can only ever announce its own service's
readiness, and a notice that matches no starting service is refused before
any state moves. That endpoint carries no send capability either, for a
stronger reason: reaching it buys a principal nothing it could not already
say about itself.

The same endpoint carries a service's **liveness renewal**, because it is
the same act — a service reporting on itself — resolved from the same
attested sender. The two differ only in which state the report is
meaningful in, which is the manager's to decide and not a second rendezvous
to bind: a transition resolves against a *starting* service, a renewal
against a *running* one. Widening the readiness resolution to cover both
would have cost it the narrow window that bounds a readiness edge to the
span between a spawn and its resolution.

An on-demand service is necessarily `notify`-ready. What a connecting client
waits for is the service's endpoint being answerable, and only the service
knows when it has bound it; treating a successful spawn as readiness would
hand the client an endpoint that does not exist yet — the very race
on-demand activation exists to close.

The compiled-in boot description spells this as its own directive:
`ondemand <path> <account>` registers a service, gives it the shared
idle-linger default, marks it `notify`-ready, and starts nothing. A discovered
bundle carries its own activation mode, linger and readiness kind in its
signed `AppInfo` instead (`ServiceSpec::from_manifest`).

## Liveness watchdog

A crashed service is one that *exited*; a **wedged** one is still present but
no longer making progress (a deadlocked driver, a serve loop stuck on a
hardware access that never returns). The manager recovers a wedge into the
same restart path a crash uses, so `plans/FIX-IO.md`'s goal — "the driver,
not the disk, is the problem" must never lock up the system — is met without
a second restart engine (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). This is the analogue of systemd's
`WatchdogSec`.

A service opts in through a non-zero `watchdog` interval: a discovered
bundle declares it in its signed unit metadata
(`tairix_abi::ServiceUnit::watchdog`), and a boot-floor service in the
compiled-in boot description's `watchdog=<n>s` directive option, which is
the one place the floor's own unit metadata has ever lived.
`Duration64::ZERO` — the default — opts out; a negative interval fails the
manifest closed. Once such a service is running, `Init::arm_watchdogs(now)`
arms a single one-shot deadline `now + interval`; the service must renew it
at least that often by calling
`Init::heartbeat(name, now)` ("I am still making progress"). A heartbeat is a
high-frequency steady-state signal and is deliberately **not** audited. If the
deadline elapses with no heartbeat, `Init::expire_watchdog` force-terminates
the wedged process and marks it as a watchdog kill, so `Init::reap` classifies
the resulting exit as an **abnormal failure** — regardless of the exit code
the forced termination reports — and feeds it to the *existing* restart
policy, backoff, and crash-loop budget. A wedged `on-failure`/`always` service
is relaunched (bounded by the same crash-loop guard, so a process that wedges
the instant it starts is eventually left down, never relaunched forever); a
`never` service is killed and left down, loudly. A deliberate `stop` disarms
the watchdog first, so a graceful teardown is never mistaken for a wedge.

### Renewing, and how a service learns its cadence

A service renews over the lifecycle-notice endpoint above, and the manager
answers **with the interval it is holding the service to**. That is what a
service programs its renewal cadence from: it needs no copy of its own unit
metadata, the two can never disagree, and a watchdog the manager later
disarms is learned about on the next renewal rather than assumed to persist.
A service the manager is not watching is told so by a zero interval and
stops calling, so opting out costs it exactly one call.

`tairix_rt::servicenotice` is the one place in the runtime that knows how to
say any of this, so every service says it identically. Its `Watchdog` holds
the interval and the next-due instant: `announce_ready` for a `notify`
service (one call that both releases its parked clients and establishes the
cadence), `attach` for an `immediate` one (which has no readiness edge left
to announce, so its first renewal is what tells it whether it is watched at
all), then `timeout_ns` folded into the park the service already performs
and `renew_if_due` each time round its loop. Renewal is therefore a deadline
on an existing wait, never a second timer and never a poll: the CPU sleeps
between renewals and an idle service still proves it is alive. The cadence
is half the interval, so a renewal and its reply have a whole further half
to complete before the manager would call the service wedged — renewing on
the deadline itself would make every scheduling delay a false kill.

The floor's one holder is `netstack` (`watchdog=30s restart=on-failure`). A
stack whose serve loop has stopped turning is still a live process, so
nothing else on the machine notices: every socket simply stops being
answered. Detecting that and then leaving the machine with no network stack
would be the worse outcome, which is why it is also an `on-failure` entry.
It learns its interval from the reply to its readiness announcement, and its
relaunch withdraws `network-up`, so what requires it is brought back against
the new stack.

The live path is proven end to end by the aarch64 liveness-watchdog QEMU
vertical, which boots the production pipeline against a disk whose
`netstack` bundle is a fixture that renews three times — past a whole
interval — and then stops renewing for good, and requires the manager to
detect the wedge, force the process down, reap it, and relaunch it. A wedge
cannot be provoked from outside a process (it is the absence of a call), and
PID 1 registers only the services its floor description names, which is why
that one program is a test double and everything around it is production.

## Reaping

PID 1 reaps its own children. The kernel reparents nothing: a process whose
parent has died leaves no zombie, and it ends with its session
([sessions](../architecture/sessions.md)). `Init::reap` drains the `Reaper`
seam: a reaped child that matches a running service is logged as a service
exit and dropped from the running set; any other is an untracked child and is
logged as such. Neither path panics (`AGENTS.md` §2.9).

Every service — and every console's `login` — is started in a session of its
own (`tairix_init::service_attach`), so stopping, restarting or losing a
service ends everything it started, and nothing a service leaves behind can
run on unreachable.

## The seams

The two operations that touch the outside world are injected, mirroring
the `drvhost` host configuration:

- `Spawner::spawn(&ServiceSpec) -> Result<Pid, Errno>` — the trusted loader
  that verifies and executes a service binary as the account the spec
  names; the kernel derives its capability grant from the signed bundle
  (init passes no capability set).
- `Stopper::{request_stop, force_terminate}(Pid)` — the two-phase graceful
  stop: ask the service to exit, then force it down after its grace period.
- `Reaper::collect() -> Option<ReapedChild>` — the source of
  exited-child notifications, draining the kernel wait queue on a running
  system.

On a running kernel these are backed by syscalls; in tests they are
in-memory fixtures. Splitting the seams from the manager keeps the
security-relevant ordering and capability code independent of kernel
plumbing and exhaustively testable.

## Audit events

`init` owns the reserved `EventId` range `9000..10000`
(`AGENTS.md` §2.5, §19.4):

| Id   | Constant               | Level | Meaning                                       |
|------|------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 9001 | `SERVICE_STARTED`      | Info  | a service was launched as its account (the kernel granted its caps) |
| 9002 | `SERVICE_START_FAILED` | Warn  | the kernel's load gate refused the spawn      |
| 9004 | `SERVICE_SKIPPED`      | Warn  | a dependency failed, so the service was skipped |
| 9005 | `SERVICE_EXITED`       | Info  | a registered service exited and was reaped    |
| 9006 | `UNTRACKED_CHILD_REAPED` | Info | a child no service record accounts for was reaped |

## The `Run` entry-point binary and startup config (`plans/PI.md` P6b)

Everything above describes the orchestrator *library*. The same package
also builds the `init` application bundle's `Run` entry-point binary
(`src/run.rs`, `AGENTS.md` §16.5) — the program the kernel spawns as PID 1
the moment it reaches user mode (`plans/PI.md` P6c, the "boot into user
mode" milestone).

That binary is a **pure-Rust freestanding program**. TAIRiX is Rust-only
(`AGENTS.md` §1), so it links the pure-Rust userland runtime `tairix-rt` —
never the C ABI (`crt0` + `abi-sys`), which exists solely for programs
**not** written in Rust (`AGENTS.md` §16.4). `tairix-rt` provides the
program's `_start`, the §19.2 stack canary, the panic handler, and
idiomatic syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names the program's
`main`. `main` renders the startup banner from the kernel-attested
`boot_facts_get` machine summary — `TAIRiX <version>: <installed memory>`
(whole MiB rounded to nearest, whole GiB above 100 GiB), a blank line, then
`<CPU name>, <n> core(s)` (e.g. `ARM Cortex-A72, 4 cores`), falling back to
`Unknown <arch> processor, <n> core(s)` when the kernel discovered no CPU
model; a kernel that installed no facts
degrades the banner to the version line with the reason on fd 2, never a
fabricated machine shape — and writes it to its inherited standard
output (fd 1) through `tairix_rt::io::Stdout` — the `abi-v1` `stream_write`
syscall (`AGENTS.md` §20; `init` binds to the inherited stream, never an
ambient device) — then **supervises** the user's session (see below). The
runtime routes `main`'s return value through the `exit` syscall. (Both the
Rust runtime and the C ABI reach the kernel through the one shared trap,
`tairix-abi-trap`, so the trap assembly is not duplicated — `AGENTS.md`
§2.2.) It links the pure-Rust orchestrator library above and drives it live
over the `lib/rt` userland heap (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-A): the
`Run` binary builds an `Init` engine over the real syscall seams — `spawn_in`
for launching a service as its account in a session of its own, `signal` for the graceful-then-forced
stop, `log_emit` (via `tairix_rt::LogSink`) for the audit sink, and a small
`LoopReaper` mailbox the park loop fills so `Init::reap` drains an exited
child without a second `wait` — never a second, parallel service manager
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). That park is the wait-set described above, so the same
loop that supervises sessions also answers the control endpoint and runs the
engine's one-shot deadlines. The tiny startup-config parser still lives alongside the
binary (`src/startup.rs`) rather than in the library.

What `init` should do at user-mode entry is **data, not control flow**: a
small, fail-closed startup config (`src/startup.rs`). The config is
line-oriented; `#` begins a comment, and blank or comment-only lines are
ignored. Five directives are defined; each names the compiled-in system
account its program runs as, resolved to a uid at parse time:

- `console` — open the system console so the banner (and later output)
  has somewhere to go. Takes no argument. Required once.
- `session <path> <account>` — the absolute path of the program `init`
  launches as the user's session (the login service
  `/System/Services/login.app/Run`, `plans/PI.md` P11, which
  authenticates the user and spawns their shell of choice) and the
  account it runs as. Required once. `init` launches it through the
  process-spawn syscall (`plans/PI.md` P6d) and supervises it (below).
- `service <path> <account>` — a long-running system service `init`
  launches at startup and supervises for the life of the system, and the
  account it runs as. Optional and repeatable; the declaration order is
  the launch order. This is the compiled-in **boot floor**
  (`AGENTS.md` §18.6); services past the floor are discovered and
  registered rather than named here (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md`).
- `enrolled <path> <account>` — the same, for a service the **enrolment
  record** governs, so an administrator's `disable` survives a reboot.
  Optional and repeatable.
- `ondemand <path> <account>` — a service that is registered but **not
  started**: the manager activates it when a client asks to connect to it
  and idle-stops it afterwards. Optional and repeatable. Such a service is
  necessarily `notify`-ready (see *On-demand activation* above).

A `service`, `enrolled`, or `ondemand` directive may follow its account with
`key=value` options, the floor's unit metadata: `watchdog=<n>s`,
`restart=never|on-failure|always`, `requires=<condition>[,…]`, and
`provides=<condition>[,…]`. A provider is `notify`-ready, since what it
provides cannot hold before it announces it. A `session` takes none.

Because the config is the first thing a freshly spawned program reads, the
parser treats it as untrusted input (`AGENTS.md` §19.5): it is
allocation-free, borrows from its source text, and **fails closed** with a
`ConfigError` — refusing an unknown or duplicated directive, a directive
given the wrong argument, a non-absolute `session` path, an unknown,
malformed, or repeated option, an over-long config, or an omitted required
directive — rather than guess at a malformed intent (`AGENTS.md` §2.9,
§5.4.5).

### Boot-floor services and session supervision (`plans/PI.md` P6e-3b-ii, `plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-A)

Once the banner has landed, the `Run` binary brings the **boot-floor
services** up through the `Init` engine and then **supervises** the login
sessions for the lifetime of PID 1, owning both rather than spawning and
forgetting them.

First it registers each `service` directive with the engine — named by its
`.app` bundle stem, run as the account the directive resolved — and calls
`start_all`, which brings them up in dependency order through the
readiness-gated admission engine above (the floor declares no dependencies,
so all start at once but `discoveryd`, which waits for `netstack` to
announce `network-up`). PID 1 names only each service's binary and its
account; the kernel — the single capability authority — verifies the signed
bundle and grants `manifest ∩ ceiling` at load time. A service the kernel
refuses to launch is reported on `stderr` and skipped, and the boot
continues with the rest — one dead service never takes down the device
manager, the other services, or the login sessions (`AGENTS.md` §2.24).

Then it runs one wait-any supervision loop that owns the per-console login
sessions directly and routes everything else to the engine:

1. it **launches** one `session` (login) process per installed text console
   with the `spawn` syscall — a separate, hardware-isolated process (a true
   `spawn`, not an `exec`-style hand-off, `AGENTS.md` §4). A refused launch
   is written to `stderr` (`Sessions::report_launch_failure`) and only that
   console's slot is abandoned; the other consoles' sessions keep running;
2. it **blocks** on any child with the `wait` syscall (`plans/SPAWN.md`
   SP6). A reaped pid that is a live session slot is relaunched on **its
   own** console, up to a small `SESSION_SPAWN_BUDGET`; every other reaped
   pid — a service the engine started, or an untracked child — is handed to
   the engine (`Init::reap`), which moves a known service to a terminal
   state (scheduling any policy-driven restart) or logs the untracked one. A
   negative `wait` — the supervisor cannot reap its own child — is surfaced
   as `EXIT_WAIT_FAILED` rather than continuing blindly.

The per-console budget is a **crash-loop guard**, not a fixed restart count:
a session that blocks on input runs for PID 1's whole life and never
approaches it; a session that exits the instant it starts would otherwise
make the loop a busy `spawn` spin, which `AGENTS.md` §2.1 forbids, so after
its budget is spent that console is abandoned. `init` declares
`EXIT_SESSION_EXHAUSTED` only when **no** session is alive **and** the
engine holds no running service — so a perpetual service (e.g. `devmgr`,
parked in `hw_tree_wait`) keeps PID 1 up for the life of the system even
after every console's session has been abandoned (fail closed, `AGENTS.md`
§2.9). A service's exit is reaped through its manifest restart policy; a
session's exit code is not yet acted on (a clean-logout-vs-crash policy
awaits a session-state ABI).

## Tests

`cargo test -p tairix-init` drives the manager against an in-memory
`Spawner`/`Reaper` and a recording log sink, covering dependency-ordered
start, the fail-closed missing-dependency and cycle paths, duplicate
registration, a spawn failure (the kernel's refused load) cascading to its
transitive dependents, and the reaper distinguishing a service
exit from an untracked child, and `register_enrolled` registering only
enrolled bundles while auditing (and never starting) a present-but-
unenrolled one. The enrolment registry has its own unit tests: fail-closed
parsing of a corrupt store, the empty (missing-store) case, strict name
validation rejecting path-traversal and case-collision shapes, the
canonical-text round trip, idempotent `enrol`, `enrol` refusing a request
that exceeds the enroller's ceiling, and `unenrol` failing closed on an
absent service. The readiness protocol is covered too: a
`notify` dependency gates its dependent until it reports ready, a
never-ready dependency leaves its dependent `inactive`, a required named
condition gates a start until satisfied, a provided condition is satisfied
when its provider becomes ready, an explicit `failed` signal skips
dependents, and a notice for an unknown or non-starting service fails
closed. These sit alongside the `EventId` range and uniqueness
invariants and the numeric audit-field formatter. The same run also
covers the `Run` binary's startup-config parser: the default config, the
comment/blank-line/inline-comment and whitespace handling, and every
fail-closed rejection path.

The `Run` binary's freestanding entry is exercised end to end under QEMU
when the production boot path spawns it into EL0: the
`spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` `-M virt` vertical proves the EL0 transition and
the banner (`plans/PI.md` P6c-3), and the `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64`
vertical proves the session supervision — PID 1 launches the session,
`wait`s on and reaps it when it exits, and relaunches it (`plans/PI.md`
P6e-3b-ii).
