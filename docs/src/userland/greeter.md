# Graphical login screen (`userland/session/greeter`)

`greeter.app` is the screen TAIRiX puts up to ask who is at the machine. It
owns the seat, paints the shared authentication surface, and relays what was
typed to the [session authority](login.md) — which is where every decision
is made. The installed binary lives at `/System/Services/greeter.app/Run`,
and the authority spawns it as the dedicated `greeter` service account
(uid 16, primary group `services`).

**The greeter draws and types; the authority decides.** They are two
processes because the greeter links the whole drawing stack, while the
authority holds the two most dangerous grants on the machine — the one that
reads the user database and the one that starts a process as another user.
Folding the drawing stack into the authority would put a large rendering
surface inside the one process that can mint any user's identity.

The crate is `no_std` (with `alloc`), has no `unsafe` outside the `Run`
binary's one documented frame mapping, and depends only on audited `lib/*`
crates, so it links no kernel, driver, or `userland/gui/*` crate. What a
screen-authentication surface *is* — the panel, the masked field, the
chooser, the geometry, the cooldown display — belongs to
[`tairix-greeter`](../lib/greeter.md), which the desktop's screen lock
composes too; this service is one of that engine's two embedders and adds
only a seat, frames, an account list, and a channel to the authority.

## Capabilities, and why they stop there

The signed `AppInfo` requests exactly five, and the `greeter` account's
ceiling in [`lib/users`](../lib/users.md) grants exactly the same five, so
the intersection the loader takes cannot be wider than this list:

| Capability | Why |
|---|---|
| `CAP_DISPLAY` | hold the seat's exclusive revocable lease, configure the display service, and switch the display off while the screen sleeps |
| `CAP_INPUT_READ` | drain the owned seat's keyboard and pointer channels |
| `CAP_SHM` | create the double-buffered frame region and grant it to the display service, so frames never cross the IPC |
| `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` | state an abnormal exit's reason on `stderr` |
| `CAP_LOG_EMIT` | its own audit records |

What it does **not** hold is the point of the design, and the account
ceiling's own tests pin each absence:

- **No `CAP_USERS_READ`.** It never sees a credential store. Everything it
  knows about the machine's accounts is what the authority chose to publish
  — a display name, a login name, and whether that account already has a
  live session — and it learns nothing at all about a secret beyond one of
  three answers.
- **No `CAP_FS_ACCESS`.** The ribbon behind the column is drawn rather than
  loaded, and the theme, the pointer and the text all come from built-in
  sets or other services, so the greeter reads no file at all.
- **No `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`, `CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER` or `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`.** It
  decodes no untrusted image, so it starts no process of any kind: it cannot
  start the session it is authenticating for, and can never choose *which*
  program runs as the authenticated user. The authority starts that on its
  own loop after the greeter exits.
- **No `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`.** It serves nothing and binds no reserved
  rendezvous; it is only ever a *client* of the session and display
  endpoints.

Compromising it therefore yields a screen, not an account.

## Bring-up

1. **Acquire the boot seat's exclusive lease.** A seat already held means
   there is no screen to own.
2. **Query the display mode** and size the scan-out from it.
3. **Map a double-buffered frame region** and grant it to the display
   service, so a frame is presented by handing over a region rather than
   copying pixels through IPC.
4. **Page the offerable accounts** off the authority's `session-v1`
   endpoint into chooser tiles. The walk is bounded three ways — by the
   `total` the first page announced, by a ceiling of eight pages' worth of
   tiles, and by the offset having to advance every round — because the
   authority's answer is input like any other; a page that repeats an
   offset, overruns the total, or never says it is last ends the walk
   rather than spinning.
5. **Raise the ribbon of light** behind the column, painted whole once.
6. **Open**: put the chrome up and begin the entry fade, so the first frame
   the display receives is full black.
7. **Paint that frame** and audit `SCREEN_READY`.
8. **Park**, which uncovers the chooser out of the black.

A verified secret fades the screen to black and then exits `0`, which also
releases the seat: the authority is watching for that exit and starts the
session itself. Exiting rather than lingering is deliberate — the seat
hand-off then has one mechanism (the kernel's reclaim on exit), no lease
transfer is needed, and a login screen cannot hold the screen behind a
running desktop. The release is owner-checked on every exit path, and a lease
already lost refuses with a typed error that is ignored rather than
escalated.

## The fade in from black

The screen this process inherits is black — cleared by the seat hand-over
from whichever session released it, or, at first boot, showing the kernel
text console. So the chooser does not snap on: `begin_entry_fade` is called
*before* the opening present, which makes that first frame full black and
lets the chooser appear out of it as the park loop runs. Nothing else is
needed for it — `refresh` steps the veil and `park_timeout` folds its next
frame, exactly as for every other animation — and under reduced motion the
fade is over before it begins, so the screen simply opens on the chooser.

Only the *leaving* direction is modal. An arriving screen answers input and
draws its pointer as usual: a user may pick an account and start typing
while it is still appearing. A secret accepted mid-arrival leaves from the
strength the veil had reached, so the screen never brightens before it
darkens.

## The fade to black

Because the desktop cannot appear until this process is gone, the handover is
seamless only if the screen is *already* black when it does: the surface's
veil is run to completion **before** the exit, and the desktop reveals from
black over the same second.

The loop that presents it is bounded and total, because it is a cosmetic step
on a decision already made and may never strand a successful login. It starts
the veil, parks for each frame the timeline asks for, presents, and stops as
soon as the veil has arrived. A frame budget derived from the theme's own
duration caps it, so even a clock that stopped leaves; a seat that stops
delivering or a wait that fails returns at once; a refused present is ignored
exactly as on any other frame. Every one of those paths still exits `0`.

The seat is drained each round but nothing is applied — unread input reads
ready forever and would spin the park, and a keystroke must not re-open a
prompt whose answer is already accepted. The pointer leaves with the screen for
the same reason: it is an affordance for a screen that has stopped answering,
so from the first veiled frame it is simply not drawn rather than left bright
over the black. Under reduced motion the duration is zero, so the screen leaves
immediately with no extra present.

## How it parks

There is one wait set, holding the seat's input, and its timeout is the
*next* thing that actually needs doing: the next clock-minute boundary, the
next one-second tick of a lockout while one is counting down, the next frame
of a running animation or of the ribbon, or the moment the display is owed its
sleep, whichever is nearer. Under reduced motion, with no lockout running,
that leaves one wake a minute for the clock and the one the sleep is owed at;
a sleeping screen has no timeout at all, arms no timer, and takes no
interrupt. There is no poll loop and no yield.

The surface animates four things — the chooser's selection mark, the travel
between the chooser and the secret prompt, a shake on a refusal, and the veil
that covers and uncovers the whole screen — and reports the soonest frame any
of them needs as one deadline. The veil is one animation run in both
directions, not two: the screen arrives out of black and leaves into it over
the same span. Every duration is theme data
([`lib/greeter`](../lib/greeter.md#motion) has the design); a reduced-motion
theme makes all four instant, asks for no frames, and leaves the idle timeout
exactly as it is.

A wake that finds nothing changed presents nothing, and every repaint
presents only the damage rectangle the surface reported — the field for a
keystroke, the panel for a verdict, the chrome band for a clock tick — so a
keystroke uploads a small rectangle rather than a screen.

A wake also drains a whole burst before it presents. Every waiting keyboard
and pointer record is applied, what each changed is merged into one
rectangle, and the display is called once with it, because a present is a
round trip to the display service and a moving mouse delivers reports far
faster than a screen refreshes. A drain that changed nothing calls nothing;
a verified secret stops the drain there and then, having presented what the
records before it changed.

## The pointer

The seat reports *relative* motion, so the screen keeps the running position
and holds it inside the frame, and hands the surface the absolute position it
hit-tests. One seat report expands to at most two surface events (a button is
a move **and** a transition) and they present as one frame, not two.

The pointer is also drawn, which is what makes it usable: the built-in
`Arrow` from [`lib/cursor`](../desktop/cursors.md) is rasterised **once** at
start-up for the active UI scale, and it is **sampled over the surface as
the frame is composed** rather than painted into it, so it is on top of
everything the surface drew and the pixels beneath it are still there when
it moves off them. Motion presents the union of the cursor's old and new
rectangles clipped to the screen — never a whole-screen present for a mouse
move, and never a cursor left painted where it no longer is — and motion the
screen edge swallows presents nothing at all. Placement is
`tairix_cursor::PlacedCursor`, the same type the compositor draws its
pointer with; a login screen may not depend on the window manager, so the
placement lives in `lib/cursor` and there is one definition of it.

Keeping the cursor out of the surface is what makes a moving mouse cheap.
The painted surface is kept between frames and painted again only when its own
content changes — a keystroke, a verdict, a countdown, a clock tick, a
chooser tile taking the focus, a ribbon being raised — so a report that
slides the pointer over an unchanged screen re-composes a cursor-sized patch
of pixels that already exist and paints nothing. Motion that does change
something merges the two rectangles and pays exactly one paint for the
report, never one per surface event it expanded into.

The **buffer** is kept too, not just its contents: a paint writes every pixel,
so it is painted in place rather than allocated afresh. An animated frame would
otherwise map, zero and unmap a screenful of pixels to draw the same picture
one step on.

The veil is the case that pays for both. It is a flat black field over
everything, so it is applied where the surface is blitted into the frame rather
than painted into it — a fade step is one blit of a surface nobody repainted.

The one thing that stops it being drawn is the screen leaving. Because the
veil is applied to what is under the cursor and the cursor is sampled over the
top, a drawn arrow would stay at full brightness all the way down to black; so the
screen hands the composer no cursor at all once the fade begins. That first
veiled frame covers the whole screen, which is what paints the arrow out
where it sat. Dimming it instead would have put a second copy of the veil's
blend arithmetic on the raw scan-out bytes, and there is one definition of
that. The position is still tracked; a move nobody can see presents nothing.

## The top of the screen

The column is centred on the screen, and one row of chrome runs along the top
of it, at the icon bar's clock size and in the muted ink:

- **Top left**, `TAIRiX 0.0.0 (lovelace)`: the OS version and host name from
  the System Information identity, which any process may read. A machine with
  no name shows the version alone; an unreachable service leaves `TAIRiX`.
- **Top right**, `Wednesday 30 September 2026 14:05`: the wall clock in UTC,
  like every clock on the system, spelled by `lib/fsmeta`'s shared calendar. A
  machine holding no trusted time shows none.

Both are rebuilt only when the minute turns. The machine's network address is
not shown: reading it takes authority the greeter does not hold, and nothing
would tell it when the address changed.

## The ribbon behind the column

The screen stands over the ribbon of light the minimal-clock screensaver
draws: the one scene in [`lib/ribbon`](../lib/ribbon.md), since the greeter
may not reach into the desktop session for it. It is its own layer — a
screen-sized surface repainted only in the strips a frame moved — and the
painted surface is `Backdrop::Scene`, transparent behind the column, laid over
it one scanline at a time through `lib/raster`'s one span composite before the
veil and the pointer. A frame of the ribbon therefore re-composes the pixels it
moved and never paints the column, and a keystroke never paints the ribbon.

The ribbon is kept clear of `AuthSurface::column_rect` — the column centred
on the screen, which no stage, keystroke or clock tick moves — so it runs
beneath the login column exactly as it runs beneath the screensaver's time,
rising until its light that shows meets it. Every line of text carries a
shadow in the ribbon's own black, so a long account name reaching past the
column, and the chrome along the top of the screen, which the ribbon is not
kept away from, stay legible. The screen is drawn in the dark theme whatever
the default appearance — dark ink on the ribbon's black would be unreadable.

The ribbon draws a frame every `tairix_ribbon::FRAME_NS`, every other display
frame, paced by its own clock, which also bounds how far a late wake carries
it; under reduced motion it holds still and asks for no frame at all. The
chrome is rebuilt only when the wall-clock minute turns, not on every frame the
ribbon wakes the loop for. A ribbon the heap will not give leaves the flat
desktop colour, audited `RIBBON_UNAVAILABLE`.

Nothing is loaded from disk and nothing is decoded, which is why the greeter
holds no filesystem authority and no spawn authority of any kind.

## Energy saving

A login screen left untouched for thirty minutes — no key, no pointer
report, not even a scroll — puts its display to sleep. The wait is the
greeter's own and fixed: the desktop's screensaver and display-off settings
belong to one user, and nobody is logged in.

- **It goes to rest first.** A fresh surface replaces the one up: the
  chooser as it first came up, with whatever was typed erased as the old
  surface drops, and no lockout shown. A half-typed secret does not outlive
  the person who walked away from it.
- **Then black, then off.** The whole frame is presented black and the
  display is asked to switch off through `lib/display`'s `DisplaySleep`, the
  same state machine the desktop's screensaver uses, audited `DISPLAY_ASLEEP`.
  A display with no power control, or one that refuses, is left showing the
  black instead (`DISPLAY_KEPT_BLACK`). Either way the display wakes on black
  rather than on the screen it went dark over.
- **Asleep, it costs nothing.** Nothing is presented, the ribbon does not
  move, the clock is not kept, and the park has no timeout.
- **The waking gesture reaches nothing.** Every record the drain reads while
  the screen sleeps is swallowed — motion still carries the pointer, so it
  comes back where the hand put it — then the display is switched back on and
  the screen arrives out of black through the entry veil, as it first did. A
  display that will not switch back on stays asleep (`DISPLAY_WAKE_REFUSED`),
  and the next input asks again.

If the greeter leaves while its display is off, the display service lights
it for the seat's next owner.

## The lockout is the account's

The authority meters each login name on its own, so the countdown the screen
shows belongs to the account it was reported for: it is shown, ticked and
enforced only while the screen asks about that account. Picking another
account never finds the first one's wait on its prompt or holding back its
secret, and going back to the first finds it still counting.

## Degradation

A login screen that refuses to appear locks a user out of their own machine,
so every absence short of "there is no screen" is presented rather than
fatal:

| Absent | What happens |
|---|---|
| No account list — the authority is unreachable, or answered with something that is not a page | the chooser stands with its typed-name tile alone, audited `ACCOUNTS_UNAVAILABLE` |
| The authority unreachable when a secret is offered | the surface says so and keeps asking. It does **not** exit, so a transient fault cannot spend the authority's restart budget |
| No memory for the ribbon | the theme's flat desktop colour, audited `RIBBON_UNAVAILABLE` |
| A display that cannot or will not switch itself off | kept black while the screen sleeps, audited `DISPLAY_KEPT_BLACK` |
| A display that will not switch back on | the screen stays asleep, audited `DISPLAY_WAKE_REFUSED`; the next input asks again |
| A pointer that will not rasterise | no cursor is drawn, audited `POINTER_UNAVAILABLE`. The pointer still moves, still hit-tests, and the keyboard alone logs in regardless |
| No trusted clock | the clock's corner is empty. Never invented |
| No machine identity, or no host name | the identity names only what is known — `TAIRiX 0.0.0`, or `TAIRiX` alone |
| A refused, unqueryable, or zero-extent display mode; a refused frame region; a wait set that could not be built | **fatal** |
| Anything going wrong during the closing fade | the exit is still `0` — the login succeeded, and a cosmetic step may not strand it |

The fatal cases all mean the same thing: there are no pixels, or the only
way to keep going would be to busy-poll. Each states its reason on `stderr`,
audits `SCREEN_UNAVAILABLE`, and exits with the bring-up code that names
what was missing — after three such exits the authority runs the text login
instead, so the machine is always loggable into. No exit reason ever names
an account or anything about a secret.

A refusal and an unreachable authority read differently on screen, because
"wrong password" and "I could not ask" call for different reactions from the
person at the keyboard, but they conclude identically: still asking. Only a
verified secret finishes the screen — there is no cancel, no timeout, and no
guest path.

## Audit events

The service owns the reserved `EventId` range `19000..20000`; the
authority's own records for the same login are in its `10000..11000` range.

| Id    | Constant                | Meaning |
|-------|-------------------------|---------|
| 19001 | `SCREEN_READY`          | the seat is held, the mode is known, and the first frame is up |
| 19002 | `SCREEN_UNAVAILABLE`    | no screen could be brought up; the authority falls back to a text login |
| 19003 | `ACCOUNTS_UNAVAILABLE`  | the account directory could not be read; the chooser stands with its typed-name tile alone |
| 19004 | `VERDICT_RECEIVED`      | the authority answered an offered secret |
| 19005 | `AUTHORITY_UNREACHABLE` | a secret was offered and no verdict came back |
| 19006 | `RIBBON_UNAVAILABLE`    | the heap would not give the ribbon; the flat desktop colour stands behind the column |
| 19007 | `POINTER_UNAVAILABLE`   | the pointer artwork would not rasterise; the pointer works but is not drawn |
| 19008 | `DISPLAY_ASLEEP`        | the screen sat untouched for thirty minutes, so its display was switched off |
| 19009 | `DISPLAY_KEPT_BLACK`    | the display could not or would not switch off, so the sleeping screen is kept black |
| 19010 | `DISPLAY_WAKE_REFUSED`  | the display would not switch back on; the next input asks again |

## Tests

`cargo test -p tairix-greeter-service` exercises everything about *what the
screen does* behind the injected seams: a keystroke reaching a verdict, a
refusal becoming a countdown, an empty account list, the bounded and
malformed paging walks, the park deadline (including an untouched screen
arming no timer), the drawn pointer and its damage, the kept surface (a move
that changes nothing paints once in total, a paint reuses the buffer it already
holds, and the frame it leaves is what a full repaint would have drawn), the
surface-to-scan-out composition — including that a veiled blit presents exactly
what the wash painted into the surface used to — and
the closing fade — that it darkens monotonically to black within its budget,
that it ends on the clock and the budget alone so a stopped clock still lets
the login leave, that input during it is ignored, that the pointer is gone
from the first veiled frame and that frame repaints where it sat while an
unveiled screen still draws it, and that reduced motion leaves at once — the
ribbon (its column kept dark, a frame presenting only what it moved and
painting nothing of the column, no stale pixel after many frames, none under
reduced motion or while asleep), the sleep and wake (nothing before thirty
idle minutes, black before the switch, nothing armed while asleep, the waking
input reaching nothing, a half-typed secret erased, a display with no power
control kept black, a refused wake staying dark until the next input), and a
lockout held back only on its own account.
`tests/session_v1.rs`
additionally wires the transport seam straight to the authority's own
request handler — a test-only edge — so the two halves of one protocol are
proven against each other rather than each against its own mock.
