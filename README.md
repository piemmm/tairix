# TAIRiX /'taɪ.rɪks/ - An exploration of practical operating system design

A security-first, multi-user, multi-core operating system written in Rust,
targeting bare-metal x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V 64, and the browser via wasm32. TAIRiX is _not_ Linux.

This file is intentionally brief. Authoritative documents live alongside the
code:

- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — binding engineering charter.
- [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) — staged delivery plan.
- [`docs/`](./docs) — long-form architecture, security, and platform book
  (built with mdBook).

## Status
**Work in progress.** - There is a long way to go before this project is ready
for prime time, if it ever will be. <span style="color:red">**Do not expect anything to work yet, Do *not* use it.**</span>

## Filesystem feature support

This table compares the ARXFS *design as implemented* against what each
foreign filesystem itself provides — the on-disk format and its canonical
Linux implementation for ext4/btrfs/XFS/bcachefs — **not** against TAIRiX's
interoperability drivers.

interoperability drivers for foreign volumes

## Security & attack-vector prevention

The attack classes TAIRiX forecloses, and where each defence stands per
target. The structural defences (capability authority, process isolation,
no ambient root, signed code) are designed in from the kernel up.

## Building

```sh
cargo xtask ci          # Full pipeline a PR must pass
cargo xtask test        # Host-side unit and integration tests
cargo xtask docs-check  # rustdoc + mdBook (with link checking)
cargo xtask run --target aarch64-rpi --profile debug
                        # Build the image and boot it in a QEMU window
                        # (display, keyboard/mouse, and a NIC on QEMU's
                        # user-mode network; also --profile installer)
cargo xtask --help      # All subcommands
```

The pinned nightly toolchain in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](./rust-toolchain.toml)
is installed automatically when `rustup` is present. External tools used by
`cargo xtask ci` are:

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-deny mdbook
```

The C-ABI conformance tests (`cargo xtask test --qemu`) additionally need the
pinned `clang` / `ld.lld` (`tairix_cc::REQUIRED_CLANG_VERSION`). Install them
once and the build finds them automatically — no environment variables — from
Homebrew (`brew install llvm lld`) or apt.llvm.org (`apt install clang-22
lld-22`); see [`tools/cc/README.md`](./tools/cc/README.md) for the search order.

The QEMU tests need QEMU 9.1 or newer on `PATH`; Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 12
package older versions. `cargo xtask run` also needs a window backend (GTK, or
Cocoa on macOS) and user-mode networking (slirp). On macOS, Homebrew's `qemu`
has all three. On Linux, `tools/ci/install-qemu.sh` builds the pinned version
from signature-verified source and names any missing build prerequisite; set
`TAIRIX_CACHE_DIR` to build it somewhere other than the CI cache directory.
