//! Shared per-run PRNG seeding, logging, and budget seam for the test
//! harnesses that draw pseudo-random inputs: the fuzz harnesses, the
//! stateful proptest models, and the filesystem and statistical-RNG soaks.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Every one of those harnesses needs the same four things, and before this
//! crate each one re-implemented them — a duplication smell:
//!
//! 1. **A per-run seed that is fresh by default but pinnable for replay.** A
//!    harness that replayed one fixed seed every run explored nothing new
//!    across repeated runs (and a soak that re-ran the same stream night after
//!    night is the busy-work the charter forbids). So by default each run draws a
//!    *fresh* seed from host entropy; setting the harness's seed environment
//!    variable pins it instead, which is how a logged failure is reproduced.
//! 2. **The seed logged at the start of the test.** Because the default seed is
//!    random, a failure is only reproducible if the seed that produced it was
//!    recorded. [`start`] prints the seed — with the exact `VAR=value` needed
//!    to replay it — before the harness draws its first input.
//! 3. **A single test execution by default, a wall-clock budget on demand.** A
//!    plain `cargo test` (a developer machine, or the per-PR `ci` gate) runs
//!    each PRNG-driven test *once* — its fixed smoke sweep, with a fresh,
//!    logged seed ([`budget_deadline`] returns `None`, so the harness loop
//!    body runs a single time). The soak orchestrators export a budget
//!    environment variable and the harness loops its continuing stream until
//!    [`within_budget`] says the time is up.
//! 4. **One generator to draw from.** [`Prng`] is the only one; a harness
//!    carrying its own is a defect, because a weak generator hides whole
//!    branches while the harness still reports green.
//!
//! It also owns the *names* of those environment variables, so the
//! orchestrator that exports one and the harness that reads it cannot drift
//! apart on a spelling.
//!
//! This crate is **test scaffolding only**. It lives under `tests/` (not
//! `lib/`, which is reserved for code that ships inside TAIRiX) and is pulled
//! in only by the host harness crates and the `tools/xtask` orchestrator, so
//! it is never part of any TAIRiX build graph.
//!
//! It deliberately depends on nothing: the seed is a *test-input* seed, not a
//! security seed, so it must not route through `lib/crypto` / `lib/rng`
//! (the charter governs the kernel CSPRNG, not host test tooling).
