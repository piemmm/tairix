//! SPAWN stage `SP6b` QEMU integration test: prove a parent process can wait
//! on, reap, and read the exit code of its own child under the live scheduler
//! on the aarch64 `virt` board.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the embedded
//! `virt` device tree (`plans/PI.md` P3/P4), brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2,
//! and installs a syscall-dispatch callback. It builds **two** hardware-isolated
//! EL0 address spaces — a `child` and a `parent`, each its own stage-1 page-table
//! hierarchy — from the two `rxe` fixture builds through the production
//! capability-checked, audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, records
//! the parent/child link with a `tairix_kernel_core::KernelProcessWait` producer,
//! and admits each as a resumable user kthread (`spawn_user_kthread`,
//! `plans/SPAWN.md` SP2).
//!
//! Driving the cooperative `step` loop interleaves the two runnable tasks. The
//! child's `exit` `svc` records its code with the producer and reaps it
//! (`reschedule_current`); the parent's `wait` `svc` is routed through the
//! producer, which parks the parent until the child is reapable, then the
//! callback copies the reaped exit code out to the parent's `status` pointer.
//! The parent verifies the code and exits 0. The test PASSes once the parent
//! reaped the child, read back the agreed code, and exited 0 — proving the
//! `wait` blocking-reap path end to end (the `SP6b` "done when"). A regression
//! (a wrong code, a missing reap, a never-draining loop) trips a distinct
//! failure finisher or the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
