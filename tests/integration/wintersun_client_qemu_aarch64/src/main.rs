//! QEMU integration vertical: **launch `WinterSun` on its reference scene from
//! a terminal and read its window back in every size state**
//! (`plans/WINTERSUN.md` WS23).
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! The reference scene is host-tested to the bit, and the window manager's
//! size states, the session's witnesses and the compositor's presentation
//! each have their own suites. What only a running machine can show is that
//! the installed bundle is complete and launchable by name from a shell, that
//! its window reaches the screen holding exactly the scene the host draws, and
//! that fullscreen, restore and maximise each put exactly that picture where
//! the window manager says the window is.
//!
//! So the guest boots the **production** aarch64 pipeline
//! (`boot_aarch64::boot`) against a planted encrypted root carrying the signed
//! input and display driver bundles and the complete app store, and the host
//! drives the desktop blind through the QEMU monitor: unlock, log in, start the
//! desktop, open a terminal from the program library, type
//! [`COMMAND_LINE`], photograph the window, press `F11`, `Escape` and the
//! title bar's size toggle, photograph each state, and finally press the
//! title bar's close control. Only the audit sink is swapped, for the PASS
//! witnesses below.
//!
//! # The PASS gate
//!
//! Three latches, in order, each attributable to exactly one act:
//!
//! 1. **The game launched.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming the game's bundle
//!    in the system application store — the shell resolving the typed word.
//! 2. **Its window opened.** A `WINDOW_CREATE_REPLY_LEN` reply on the
//!    reserved window endpoint after that load. The game opens one window,
//!    and the terminal's was created before the game was loaded.
//! 3. **It left cleanly.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming [`THEN_COMMAND`]'s
//!    bundle after that create: the typed line joins the two with `&&`, so
//!    the shell loads it only once the game exited with status zero.
//!
//! # Why the guest cannot exit early
//!
//! The game leaves only when its window is closed, and the runner sends no
//! pointer step while a screendump it has asked for is still being taken, so
//! the last latch cannot land before the last dump is on disk.
//!
//! A panic before all three latches parks the CPU, the guest falls silent,
//! and the runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
