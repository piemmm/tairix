//! QEMU integration vertical: **open the taskbar clock's *Set Date & Time…*
//! row, authenticate through the elevation broker, and witness the Date &
//! Time window on screen**.
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! Every piece of elevation *logic* — the credential prompt, the broker's
//! re-authentication, the Launch reply — is already covered by host unit
//! tests. What only a real machine can show is that those pieces are
//! **wired to each other and to the running application**: that the
//! session's `SetDateTime` outcome opens the prompt, that the broker starts
//! `/System/Applications/datetime.app/Run` as the authenticated account,
//! and that the application creates a window the desktop session serves.
//!
//! So the guest boots the **production** aarch64 pipeline
//! (`boot_aarch64::boot`) against a planted encrypted root, and the host
//! drives the desktop blind through the QEMU monitor: unlock, log in, start
//! the desktop, right-click the clock, choose *Set Date & Time…*, type the
//! fixture account into the prompt. Only the audit sink is swapped, for the
//! PASS witnesses below.
//!
//! # The PASS gate
//!
//! Two latches, each attributable to exactly one act:
//!
//! 1. **The application launched.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming the
//!    Date & Time bundle.
//! 2. **Its window was opened.** [`WINDOWS_OPENED`] create replies were
//!    served on the reserved window endpoint, recognised by the distinctive
//!    wire length unique to a create among that endpoint's replies.
//!
//! # Why the guest cannot exit early
//!
//! The window is opened by the elevated program after the credentials are
//! typed, and the runner sends no keystroke until the pointer script has
//! opened the prompt. So the create that completes the PASS cannot happen
//! until the prompt is up and the credentials are offered.
//!
//! A panic before both latches parks the CPU, the guest falls silent, and
//! the runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
