//! SPAWN Stage SP1 QEMU integration test: two kernel-thread tasks
//! ping-pong through the **real** Arch HAL `ContextSwitch::switch` under
//! the live `kernel/sched` scheduler on the aarch64 `virt` board.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! `plans/SPAWN.md` Stage SP1 requires the `kernel/core` kthread runtime
//! to make a scheduler task a *resumable kernel thread* with its own
//! kernel stack, driven through the existing `ContextSwitch` HAL, and to
//! prove it on at least one bare-metal board by having **two** kthreads
//! ping-pong via the real `ContextSwitch::switch`. That promotes
//! `ContextSwitch::switch` — until now exercised only by the W7
//! `sched_drive_*` round-trip — to a *production* scheduling path.
//!
//! This binary exercises that on the `virt` board:
//!
//! 1. **Discovered GICv2 + timer rate (PI Stage P4).** It reads the GICv2
//!    base and the generic-timer frequency from the embedded canonical
//!    `virt` device tree and brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2 so the
//!    scheduler's spawn IPIs target a configured controller. The two
//!    kthreads deliberately hold opposite IRQ-mask states across each yield,
//!    proving processor continuation state follows the task rather than
//!    leaking between task and dispatcher.
//! 2. **Live scheduler + two kthreads.** It builds a real
//!    `tairix_kernel_sched_eevdf::Scheduler` over `Aarch64Arch` and spawns
//!    two kthreads through `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_kthread`. Each
//!    kthread body runs on its own kernel stack and calls
//!    `Yielder::yield_now` `PING_PONGS` times — each yield is a real
//!    `ContextSwitch::switch` back to the dispatcher — then returns
//!    (`Exit`).
//! 3. **Ping-pong + drain.** It drives the cooperative `step` loop; the
//!    scheduler interleaves the two runnable tasks, so they alternate. PASS
//!    once both kthreads have run exactly `PING_PONGS` times and both
//!    have exited (no task left live).
//!
//! A regression in the runtime (a switch that does not transfer control,
//! a task that never resumes, a stack that is not reclaimed) either trips
//! a dedicated failure finisher or never drains the workload, so the run
//! fails loudly — by an explicit failure code or by the harness
//! `Outcome::Timeout`.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links the `tairix-kernel-core` kthread runtime, the
//! `tairix-arch-aarch64` port, and the default `tairix-kernel-sched-eevdf`
//! policy directly and supplies its own `kernel_main`, so the runtime is
//! exercised without the full `kernel_core::kernel_main` init pipeline.
//! The QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin, never behind a
//! Cargo feature on a library crate (fail closed).
