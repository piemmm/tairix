//! `plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU3 acceptance QEMU integration test: boot the
//! production aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the
//! planted whole-disk encrypted-root image, log in as the seeded `root`
//! account, and drive the spawned shell through a real session under the
//! account's **administrator capability ceiling** — then prove the
//! `user ceiling ∩ manifest request` intersection still binds the shell.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The production boot path discovers and binds the virtio-blk root,
//! admits the in-kernel unlock kthread, and (once the runner types the
//! fixture passphrase at `Root passphrase: `) mounts the encrypted `ARXFS`
//! root and installs the users database. PID 1's console login then
//! prompts; the runner authenticates `root`/`root` against the planted
//! account — whose grant is the shared administrator ceiling
//! (`tairix_users::administrator_ceiling`, the same set
//! `tools/mkimage`'s profile-keyed seeding gives a debug image) — and login
//! spawns the account's shell **as that user**, in a session of its own. The
//! runner's ordered serial script (`tools/xtask`) then holds a real
//! session with the shell, each line typed only after its marker appeared:
//!
//! 1. `cd /Users/root` — the shell's effective set is
//!    `SESSION_BASELINE ∩ administrator ceiling = SESSION_BASELINE`, so
//!    `CAP_FS_ACCESS` admits `fs_chdir` and the secured VFS authorises the
//!    account's home directory (the B3 regression: before CU3 the seeded
//!    grant omitted `CAP_FS_ACCESS` and every filesystem call was denied).
//! 2. `pwd` — prints `/Users/root`, proving the chdir actually moved the
//!    process.
//! 3. `/System/Commands/ps.app/Run` — `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` admits `spawn`; `ps`
//!    runs as the same user, queries its self-scoped process list through
//!    `sysinfod`, prints the shared `PID  PPID …` header, and exits.
//! 4. `man man` — the spawned `man` tool resolves its own bundle through
//!    the shared store-then-`PATH` policy, reads the planted
//!    `/System/Commands/man.app/Help/en-US/man.md` off the mounted read-only
//!    `/System` volume through the `fs_*` syscalls (`CAP_FS_ACCESS` from
//!    its own manifest), and streams the rendered page; the page's final
//!    `SEE ALSO` heading is the marker that the whole document arrived
//!    (`plans/APPS.md` §7).
//! 5. `ls /System/Commands` — the spawned `ls` tool stats the operand and
//!    reads the directory through the `fs_stat`/`fs_readdir` syscalls
//!    (`CAP_FS_ACCESS` from its own manifest); `man.app` in the listing is
//!    the marker, an entry only a real directory read of the mounted
//!    read-only `/System` volume produces (`plans/APPS.md` deliverable 6).
//! 6. `ulimit processes 1000` — **lowering** a bound pair needs no
//!    capability and succeeds.
//! 7. `ulimit -H processes 2000` — **raising** the hard bound needs
//!    `CAP_RLIMIT_RAISE`. The administrator *ceiling* carries it, but the
//!    shell's *manifest* (the session baseline) does not request it, so
//!    the effective set lacks it: the kernel refuses the `rlimit_set` with
//!    `PermissionDenied` (fail closed) and the shell prints the denial.
//!    This is the negative half: holding an administrator account does not
//!    widen any one program past its own manifest.
//! 8. `exit` — typed after the denial message appeared, ending the shell.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on "denial, then exit"
//!
//! The audit sink arms on the dispatcher's `SYSCALL_HANDLER_REJECTED`
//! record (`EventId(5004)`) carrying `sc=rlimit_set` and
//! `err=PermissionDenied` — the kernel-side witness that the raise was
//! refused by the capability check, not by an argument error — and reports
//! PASS on the **next** audited `exit` dispatch (`EventId(5000)`,
//! `sc=exit`). Exiting on the rejection itself would tear QEMU down inside
//! the syscall, before the shell printed the denial and before the runner
//! sent the final scripted line; keying on the exit that only the runner's
//! post-denial `exit` command produces guarantees the denial reached the
//! transcript. `ps`'s own earlier `exit` cannot false-trigger: the flag is
//! not armed until the rejection has been seen. The runner additionally
//! fails the run if the guest exits before every scripted marker appeared
//! and every line was sent, so a session that dies mid-dialogue cannot
//! pass. A run where the root never mounts, login never authenticates, the
//! shell is denied `fs_chdir` (the B3 defect), `ps` never spawns, or the
//! raise is *not* refused never reaches the armed exit, so the harness
//! times out — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`),
//! so the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build
//! time (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which
//! discovers the board from it exactly as it would from real firmware.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces
//! the audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate
//! bin (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production
//! build (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does
//! next).
