//! QEMU integration vertical: **an unconfigured machine that can draw boots
//! to the graphical login screen** (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` G7.1).
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! Which login a round runs is decided by pure, host-tested policy
//! (`tairix_login::session`). What only a real machine can show is that the
//! policy is fed the truth: that the display driver has autoloaded and bound
//! its service, that the encrypted root is mounted by the time the round
//! begins, and that the settings store on that root answers "I hold no
//! configuration" rather than "I am not here". Get any of those wrong and a
//! machine that could show a login screen sits at a text prompt instead —
//! which is exactly the defect this vertical was written for: login probed
//! for the store's *directory*, a directory `configure` only creates on its
//! first write, so every never-configured installation read as an
//! unmountable volume and pinned itself to the text prompt.
//!
//! # The disk is the experiment
//!
//! The backing volume is `FsDisk::GreeterRootDisk`, which carries the same
//! signed input and display driver bundles as the autoload vertical but the
//! **standard** application store — no planted `os.loginType`. That is the
//! state a fresh installation boots in, and the host script types nothing
//! but the unlock passphrase: no account, no `desktop` command, nothing that
//! could ask for a graphical session. So the login screen can only be here
//! because login chose it.
//!
//! # The PASS witnesses
//!
//! Both are **kernel-attested**. A userland record reaches the diagnostic
//! sink only — the audit sink stays kernel-only, so user space can neither
//! forge nor truncate an entry — which is why the greeter's own
//! "the login screen is up" cannot be the gate, however plainly it reads on
//! the serial transcript.
//!
//! 1. **Login chose the graphical round.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming the
//!    greeter's bundle in the system service store: the kernel verified and
//!    loaded it. Nothing else on this disk launches that bundle, and a text
//!    round never asks for it, so the record is login's decision itself.
//!    `PROCESS_SPAWNED` would not do — it carries an entry address and can
//!    attribute no bundle.
//! 2. **A frame reached the screen.** The next reply the display service
//!    serves on its reserved endpoint, once (1) has latched. The greeter is
//!    the only graphical client alive at that point — no desktop, no app,
//!    and the script types nothing after the passphrase — so the exchange is
//!    the login screen's own present. Ordering after (1) is what makes it
//!    attributable: an unordered reply on a shared rendezvous belongs to
//!    nobody in particular.
//!
//! Together they say the machine decided on the graphical login *and*
//! reached the point of drawing it. A text round, a greeter that cannot
//! paint, or a panic all leave a latch open: the guest never exits, and the
//! runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
