//! SPAWN Stage SP1 QEMU integration test: two kernel-thread tasks
//! ping-pong through the **real** Arch HAL `ContextSwitch::switch` under
//! the live `kernel/sched` scheduler on the riscv64 `virt` board.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! `plans/SPAWN.md` Stage SP1 requires the `kernel/core` kthread runtime
//! to make a scheduler task a *resumable kernel thread* with its own
//! kernel stack, driven through the existing `ContextSwitch` HAL, and to
//! prove it on every bare-metal board by having **two** kthreads ping-pong
//! via the real `ContextSwitch::switch`. The aarch64 vertical landed first
//! (`tests/integration/kthread_switch_qemu_aarch64`); this is the riscv64
//! sibling, so the runtime is a *production* scheduling path on riscv64
//! too — until now `ContextSwitch::switch` was exercised here only by the
//! W7 `sched_drive_qemu_riscv64` round-trip.
//!
//! This binary exercises that on the `virt` board:
//!
//! 1. **Discovered timebase.** It reads the generic-timer frequency from
//!    the firmware device tree (the verbatim `a1` pointer OpenSBI hands the
//!    boot hart) and fails closed if the tree omits it, rather than
//!    guessing a divisor.
//! 2. **Live scheduler + two kthreads.** It builds a real
//!    `tairix_kernel_sched_eevdf::Scheduler` over `RiscvArch` and spawns
//!    two kthreads through `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_kthread`. Each kthread
//!    body runs on its own kernel stack and calls `Yielder::yield_now`
//!    `PING_PONGS` times — each yield is a real `ContextSwitch::switch`
//!    back to the dispatcher — then returns (`Exit`).
//! 3. **Ping-pong + drain.** It drives the cooperative `step` loop;
//!    `Scheduler::spawn` raises a (self-)IPI on the home CPU via the SBI
//!    IPI extension, which a hart with supervisor interrupts masked simply
//!    leaves pending (dispatch here is the cooperative `step` loop, so the
//!    kthread switches are the only mechanism under test). PASS once both
//!    kthreads have run exactly `PING_PONGS` times and both have exited (no
//!    task left live).
//!
//! A regression in the runtime (a switch that does not transfer control, a
//! task that never resumes, a stack that is not reclaimed) either trips a
//! dedicated failure finisher or never drains the workload, so the run
//! fails loudly — by an explicit failure code or by the harness
//! `Outcome::Timeout`.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links the `tairix-kernel-core` kthread runtime, the
//! `tairix-arch-riscv64` port, and the default `tairix-kernel-sched-eevdf`
//! policy directly and supplies its own `kernel_main`, so the runtime is
//! exercised without the full `kernel_core::kernel_main` init pipeline. The
//! QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin, never behind a Cargo
//! feature on a library crate (fail closed).
