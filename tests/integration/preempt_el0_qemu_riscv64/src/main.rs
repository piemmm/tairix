//! `plans/PI.md` D2b-2b-A P-1b QEMU integration test (riscv64 sibling of the
//! aarch64 `preempt_el0_qemu_aarch64` vertical): prove the production
//! supervisor-timer interrupt **involuntarily preempts** a runaway U-mode task
//! on the riscv64 `virt` board.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the `timebase-frequency` from the firmware device
//! tree (the `a1` DTB pointer OpenSBI hands the boot hart), installs the S-mode
//! trap vector via `trap::install_trap_vector` — deliberately NOT `init_traps`,
//! so `sstatus.SIE` stays clear and the kernel itself is never preempted — and
//! installs a syscall-dispatch callback. It builds one hardware-isolated Sv39
//! U-mode address space from the `el0_spinner` `rxe` fixture through the
//! production capability-checked, audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image`
//! caller and admits it as a resumable user kthread (`spawn_user_kthread`).
//!
//! It then arms the **production** preemption path verbatim (the same `tairix_arch_riscv64::preempt` surface the bin crate's
//! `arm_preemption` uses): registers a per-hart `PreemptStorage`, installs a
//! U-mode-preemption callback that suspends the running task back to the
//! scheduler via `reschedule_current(_, Yield)`, and starts the periodic SBI
//! timer (`init_local_preempt` sets `sie.STIE`). A supervisor-timer interrupt
//! is taken while the spinner runs in U-mode because the hart runs below S-mode
//! (the privilege rule U < S), regardless of `sstatus.SIE`; the trap handler
//! gates the preempt point on the saved `SPP` so only a U-mode tick preempts.
//!
//! Driving the `step` loop dispatches the spinner into U-mode, where it
//! busy-loops issuing **no** syscall. Because the loop never traps, the *only*
//! thing that can return control to the dispatcher before the spinner's final
//! `exit` is an involuntary timer preemption. The test PASSes once (a) the
//! preempt callback fired at least once **and** (b) the task — correctly
//! resumed mid-loop after each preemption — still completed its spin and
//! exited. A preemption that never fires (the `step` never returns) or a
//! botched resume (the task never exits) stalls the drain, so the run fails
//! loudly — by a failure code or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
