//! `plans/DHCP.md` D3 QEMU integration test: boot the production x86_64
//! `tairix-kernel` pipeline against the shared `dhcp-net-root` whole-disk
//! image — whose read-only `/System` volume carries the **kernel-signed
//! virtio-net driver bundle** (cross-compiled for x86_64) and a planted
//! `/System/Settings/Network/network.conf` — with a `virtio-net-pci` device
//! attached on the PCI bus and the harness-side **DHCP-server** link peer on
//! the QEMU `dgram` netdev, and prove RFC 2131 dynamic IPv4 addressing end to
//! end over the x86_64 virtio-**PCI** + MSI-X device-IRQ path.
//!
//! ## What this vertical asserts — and how it differs from its siblings
//!
//! * The static-addressing vertical (`netstack_static_qemu_x86_64`) proves the
//!   declarative `match.node` binding with a *static* IPv6 address. This
//!   vertical proves the **dynamic** path on the same bus: the planted
//!   `network.conf` binds the NIC to the `wan` alias by its stable bus
//!   location (`<iface>.match.node` = the virtio-PCI config-window BAR base the
//!   kernel enumerator assigns) but selects `ipv4.method dhcp` and disables
//!   IPv6, so the interface forms **no** address on its own — `netstack` must
//!   drive its DHCP client to *lease* one from the host DHCP-server peer.
//! * `netstack_dhcp_qemu_aarch64` proves the same dynamic path over the
//!   virtio-**MMIO** bus. This is its x86_64 virtio-PCI sibling: the only
//!   difference is the `match.node` value the planted config names (the BAR
//!   base the kernel's PCI enumerator assigns).
//! * The host peer runs a minimal DHCP server (OFFER on DISCOVER, ACK on
//!   REQUEST) leasing `DHCP_LEASED_V4`, then pings the guest at that leased
//!   address. If the DHCP exchange failed the guest has no IPv4 at all and the
//!   campaign goes unanswered, so the run times out fail-loud rather than
//!   passing on an address the guest formed itself — a real discriminator,
//!   not a tautology.
//!
//! The production boot path (the `/System` store binds independently of the
//! encrypted-root passphrase, so the config is read pre-unlock — headless, no
//! console dialogue, exactly like the static/headless siblings):
//!
//! 1. **Discovers** the virtio-block root *and* the virtio-net node
//!    (bootstrap-floor virtio-PCI enumeration). The NIC node carries its four
//!    role-tagged config windows, a coherent DMA constraint, and the routed
//!    MSI line the kernel enumerator allocated and programmed into the
//!    function's MSI-X table entry 0.
//! 2. **Autoloads** the signed virtio-net bundle from the mounted `/System`
//!    store into its own user-space process; the driver brings the device up
//!    over `PciTransport` (`enable_msix(0)`), claims its reserved
//!    device-channel endpoint, and publishes a `netchan` hardware-tree node.
//! 3. The long-running user-space **`devmgr`** service observes the `netchan`
//!    node, calls **`netstack`** `BindDriver`, *and* reads the planted
//!    `network.conf`, delivering the `wan` interface's DHCPv4 configuration.
//! 4. **`netstack`** binds the `wan` alias to the NIC, starts its DHCP client,
//!    broadcasts DISCOVER, accepts the peer's OFFER, REQUESTs it, applies the
//!    peer's ACK (leasing the interface its only address), and answers the
//!    host peer's echo campaign to that leased address.
//!
//! ## How the run completes — harness-driven, race-free
//!
//! The guest does **not** self-terminate. It boots the production pipeline and
//! keeps serving the host peer's leased-address echo campaign; the harness
//! ends the run the instant the peer's out-of-guest observer confirms
//! success — it received the guest's echo reply at the leased address. That
//! confirmation is the *last* link in the causal chain (driver autoloaded and
//! bound, the DHCP lease acquired and applied, an inbound echo served and its
//! reply transmitted back over virtio-PCI), so a guest that instead
//! self-exited on an intermediate witness would tear the machine down before
//! the reply left it and lose the race — the defect this choreography
//! removes. The witness records (`devmgr`'s `NETSTACK_BOUND`, `netstack`'s
//! `DHCP_LEASE_ACQUIRED` and `INBOUND_ECHO_SERVED`) still reach the serial
//! transcript for diagnosis, and the peer's own DHCP-server + leased-address
//! echo campaign verdict subsumes them: it cannot be met unless the lease was
//! granted and the reply arrived. A run that never earns the peer's
//! confirmation fails loud on the runner's inactivity/absolute deadline.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline unchanged. The only
//! difference is that it is a dedicated test bin the harness drives to
//! completion through the peer's success gate — there is no in-kernel QEMU-exit
//! shortcut to leak into a production build (fail closed; the harness never
//! decides what the kernel does next).
