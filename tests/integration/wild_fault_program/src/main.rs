//! Ring-3 wild-fault fixture: a minimal, separately-linked pure-Rust user
//! program built once and driven in four argv-selected roles, three of which
//! take an exception the kernel must charge to the task and to nothing else
//! (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D42, D86).
//!
//! * **`parent`** — spawns the three faulting roles below through the
//!   production `spawn` syscall and reaps each through the production
//!   blocking `wait`, asserting every one was fault-killed with exit code
//!   139 (`128 + SIGSEGV`). Its own survival is the load-bearing assertion:
//!   the parent can only reap a third child if neither of the first two
//!   parked the CPU. Exits `0` only when all three died correctly.
//! * **`jump`** — calls a function pointer built from the address of one of
//!   its own `static`s. The image builder maps data pages No-Execute, so the
//!   call takes a ring-3 **instruction-fetch** page fault: never resolvable
//!   (a file mapping is never executable), so the kernel must kill the task
//!   rather than park the core.
//! * **`ud`** — executes an architecturally-invalid opcode, raising a ring-3
//!   exception that is *not* a page fault, on a vector the CPU pushes no
//!   hardware error code for.
//! * **`gp`** — executes a privileged instruction, raising a ring-3
//!   exception on a vector the CPU *does* push an error code for (the other
//!   exception-stub shape).
//!
//! Surviving any faulting role is the defect each exists to catch, so each
//! returns a distinct non-zero code the parent surfaces.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: it links the Rust userland runtime
//! `tairix-rt` (`_start`, stack canary, panic handler, syscall wrappers),
//! never the C ABI. Built position-independent and converted to an `rxe`
//! blob by the consuming test's build script. Off the freestanding x86_64
//! target it is an inert stub, so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and fmt
//! still cover the crate; the two trapping roles name mnemonics no other
//! architecture shares, and `build.rs` documents why that decision lives
//! there rather than in a target predicate here.
