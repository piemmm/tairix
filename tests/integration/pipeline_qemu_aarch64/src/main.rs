//! `plans/SPAWN.md` `SP10b` QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, log in as the seeded `root` account,
//! and drive the spawned shell through real **pipelines and redirections**
//! over the spawn attach block and kernel pipes.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The production boot path unlocks and mounts the encrypted `ARXFS`
//! root, login authenticates `root`/`root`, and the session shell runs
//! the runner's ordered script:
//!
//! 1. `yes | head -n 2` — a two-member kernel pipeline whose consumer
//!    exits first: `head` prints two lines and exits, the pipe loses its
//!    last reader, `yes`'s next write fails `BrokenPipe` and it exits,
//!    and the shell reaps the non-leader member after the leader. The
//!    witness is the next prompt appearing at all — a missed broken-pipe
//!    delivery or an unreaped member would hang the session and time the
//!    run out.
//! 2. `seq 1 1000 | wc -c` — the consumer's `3893` on the transcript is
//!    byte-exact arithmetic over the pipe's entire payload (the 2893
//!    digits plus 1000 newlines of `1..=1000`), output the typed line
//!    itself never contains, so it proves every byte crossed the kernel
//!    pipe in order.
//! 3. `lspci --help` — the resource-carrying `lspci.app` bundle end to
//!    end (`plans/DEVICES.md` DEVICE1 V2): the spawn's load gate re-hashes
//!    the whole on-disk bundle — including the planted
//!    `Resources/pci.ids.bin` table — against the signed `AppInfo` content
//!    hash, and the help summary's `PCI/PCIe` on the transcript witnesses
//!    the tool ran. The `virt` image drives virtio-mmio devices, so the
//!    tree carries no PCI-function nodes to list yet; the listing path is
//!    host-proven in `tairix-lspci`'s tests.
//! 4. `lsusb --help` — the same proof for the resource-carrying
//!    `lsusb.app` bundle (`plans/DEVICES.md` DEVICE1 V3): the load gate
//!    re-hashes it — including the planted `Resources/usb.ids.bin` table —
//!    and the help summary's `USB devices` witnesses the tool ran; the
//!    listing path is host-proven in `tairix-lsusb`'s tests.
//! 5. `seq 776001 776005 > /Users/root/nums.txt` — the shell pre-opens
//!    the target (create + truncate) in its own table and wires it as the
//!    child's stdout through the spawn attach block.
//! 6. `cat < /Users/root/nums.txt` — the round trip back: the shell opens
//!    the file read-only and wires it as `cat`'s stdin; `776005` on the
//!    transcript is content only step 5's write could have produced.
//! 7. `exit` — typed only after the content marker appeared.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on `cat`'s exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! `pipe_create` is deliberately unaudited, so the kernel-side witness is
//! the round trip's `cat` exiting (`SyscallInvoked`, `EventId(5000)`,
//! `sc=exit`, `comm=cat`) — the last scripted tool, which only runs after
//! every pipeline step completed. Exiting QEMU there would tear the run
//! down before the runner observed the content marker and sent its final
//! line, so the sink only *arms* on it and reports PASS on the **next**
//! audited `exit` — the shell's, typed only after `776005` appeared — so
//! the verified bytes provably reached the transcript before the run
//! ended (the session-ceiling arm-then-exit discipline). The runner
//! additionally fails the run if the guest exits before every scripted
//! marker appeared and every line was sent. A refused spawn wire, a hung
//! pipe, an unreaped member, or a wrong byte count never reaches the
//! armed exit: the run times out with the failing step in the serial
//! transcript — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`),
//! so the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build
//! time (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which
//! discovers the board from it exactly as it would from real firmware.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces
//! the audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate
//! bin (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production
//! build (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does
//! next).
