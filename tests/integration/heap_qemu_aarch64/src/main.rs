//! PI P6e-3b prerequisite QEMU integration test: prove the `tairix-rt`
//! `mem_map`-backed global allocator works end to end in an EL0 process on the
//! aarch64 `virt` board (`plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the embedded
//! `virt` device tree (`plans/PI.md` P3/P4), brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2,
//! and installs a syscall-dispatch callback and a fault handler. It builds one
//! hardware-isolated EL0 address space — its own stage-1 page-table hierarchy —
//! from the `rxe` fixture program through the production capability-checked,
//! audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, **retains it live**, and
//! installs a `tairix_kernel_core::MemMap` producer backed by
//! `tairix_kernel_mem::map_anonymous` / `unmap_anonymous` over that space and
//! its frame pool. It admits the program as a resumable user kthread
//! (`spawn_user_kthread`, `plans/SPAWN.md` SP2) and drains the cooperative
//! `step` loop; the dispatch callback routes the program's allocator-issued
//! `mem_map` / `mem_unmap` `svc`s through the producer.
//!
//! The fixture program (`tests/integration/heap_program`) Box-allocates, grows
//! a `Vec` across several pages, reallocates after freeing, drives the
//! pressure-band trim that hands the arena back, verifies every value, and
//! exits 0. A clean `exit(0)` is the PASS signal *and* at least one range must
//! have reached `mem_unmap`, since the arena is resized in granules and a
//! fixture whose whole traffic fits inside one would otherwise leave the
//! release path untested. Any shortfall (a non-zero exit code, an unexpected
//! syscall, a fault, or no unmap at all) trips a distinct failure finisher or
//! times out, so the run fails loudly.
