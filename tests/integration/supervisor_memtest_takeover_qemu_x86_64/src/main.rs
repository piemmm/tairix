//! `plans/NEW-SUPERVISOR.md` §9 Stage E QEMU integration test: boot the
//! production x86_64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline and drive the pre-boot
//! Supervisor's one-way **`memtest` takeover**, proving the
//! x86_64 `MachineTakeover` mechanism takes the whole machine over and tests
//! all of RAM continuously. The x86_64 sibling of the aarch64/riscv64 takeover
//! verticals.
//!
//! ## What this vertical asserts
//!
//! It exercises the x86_64 machine-takeover mechanism end to end — the one
//! part of `memtest` that can only be proven on QEMU (the confirmation,
//! command parsing, and the arch-neutral sweep are host-tested in
//! `lib/supervisor` and `kernel/mem`). On `AuditEvent::BootCompleted`
//! (`EventId(4004)`) — the point at which the Supervisor system is published
//! and the kernel state (frame allocator, boot memory map, direct physical
//! map) is fully built — the audit sink drives the real published
//! `SupervisorSystem::memtest_takeover` seam, exactly as the `memtest` command
//! does (there is only the one whole-RAM test and no confirmation prompt;
//! the command dispatch is host-tested in `lib/supervisor`, and the takeover
//! is driven directly here because the takeover run cannot return to key
//! the REPL).
//!
//! The guest boots with four CPUs, so this genuinely exercises the cross-CPU
//! quiesce: `drive_takeover` stops the three application processors through
//! the bounded IPI-halt handshake before the tear-down begins.
//!
//! On the wired x86_64 port `memtest_takeover` **never returns**: the caller
//! quiesces every other CPU, then the `MachineTakeover` body masks interrupts
//! (`cli`), switches onto a reserved `.bss` stack, installs the reserved boot
//! page tables, and tests every usable frame on that stack — cycling every
//! pattern over all of RAM, over and over, rendering the memtest86-style
//! display (elapsed timer, completed-loop count, error log) to COM1. The
//! takeover never resets the board itself; once the guest prints the
//! completed-test-loop marker the harness issues a QEMU-monitor `system_reset`,
//! and under `-no-reboot` that reset exits the host process so the runner
//! registers `Outcome::Pass`.
//!
//! A boot that never reached a completed test loop would fall silent and time
//! out (`Outcome::Timeout`), and a takeover that *returned* (refused/
//! unsupported) makes the sink write a fail finisher — so a regression that
//! stops the test running fails loud rather than passing by accident.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the observer behaviour into a separate bin (instead
//! of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature unification from
//! leaking the takeover trigger into any production build (fail closed; the
//! harness never decides what the kernel does next).
