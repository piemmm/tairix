//! `plans/NETWORK.md` N5c QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the
//! harness-side passive TCP echo peer on its `dgram` netdev, then prove the
//! **stream-socket** (`SocketType::Stream`) path end to end over the live
//! two-process network — client process, network stack, and virtio-net driver
//! each in its own address space.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the shared encrypted-root fixture whose read-only
//! `/System` volume carries the standard signed store bundles **plus** the
//! signed virtio-net driver bundle (so `devmgr` autoloads it into its own
//! process and `netstack` binds it) **plus** the test-only `tcpecho` fixture
//! bundle (`tests/integration/tcpecho_program`), all composed and signed by
//! the same `tools/xtask` composer as every store bundle and planted only on
//! this vertical's disk — no production image ever ships the fixtures.
//!
//! The runner unlocks the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates
//! `root`/`root` at the console login, and types the bare command word
//! `tcpecho` at the shell: the store-then-`PATH` resolution finds
//! `/System/Commands/tcpecho.app/Run`, the disk-backed spawn path verifies the
//! signed bundle, and the client runs with `manifest ∩ administrator-ceiling`
//! authority (its manifest requests `CAP_NET`, enforced by the netstack socket
//! dispatcher against the kernel-attested origin). The client opens a stream
//! socket, connects to the peer's echo server over the shared IPv6 link-local
//! wire, streams a fixed deterministic byte run, and verifies the peer echoes
//! every byte back in order. The peer injects bounded frame loss, so a passing
//! run proves RFC 9293 retransmission carried the stream across the
//! two-process boundary — not merely a clean link.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the client's exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! On a fully verified transfer the client prints its `TCPECHO PASS …` line
//! and exits `0`; on **any** shortfall it prints the reason and parks forever
//! — it never exits — so the client's audited `exit` (`SyscallInvoked`,
//! `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=tcpecho`) is itself the kernel-side
//! witness of a verified transfer. Exiting QEMU on that record would tear the
//! run down before the runner observed the marker and sent its final line, so
//! the sink only *arms* there and reports PASS on the **next** audited `exit`
//! — the shell's, which the runner types only after the `TCPECHO PASS` marker
//! appeared past the client's own output. The runner additionally fails the
//! run if the guest exits before every scripted marker appeared, and the
//! harness requires the echo peer to report the whole transfer received and
//! echoed, so neither side can pass alone. A refused connect, a mismatched or
//! truncated echo, or a client crash therefore never reaches the armed exit:
//! the run times out with the diagnosis in the serial transcript — the
//! documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
