//! `PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW QEMU integration test: prove the kernel-side
//! production driver spawner end to end on the aarch64 `virt` board.
//!
//! The build script compiles the pure-Rust driver-stub program
//! (`tests/integration/driver_register_program`) position-independent and
//! converts it to an `rxe` blob carrying the kernel's compiled-in syscall CFI
//! tag, registered in the test kernel's `ProgramRegistry` under a
//! `/System/Drivers/` path. On boot the test discovers the board from the
//! embedded `virt` device tree, enables the identity MMU + EL1 vectors,
//! builds a live `FrameAllocator`, publishes the reply `Port` (send-gated on
//! a driver-class capability) into a live `RwLock<PortRegistry>` — both the
//! endpoint binding and its well-known port name — installs
//! the production `KernelDispatchHook` through a `DispatchCallbackSlot`, and
//! spawns the stub through the production parameterised
//! `Aarch64ProcessSpawn` image builder via the exported `KernelSpawnCtx` admit
//! path — driver-class caps plus the reply endpoint id in `arg(1)`, exactly
//! the hand-off the driver host gives a spawned driver process.
//!
//! The host side then drives the cooperative `step` loop, polling
//! `Port::recv` between steps under a bounded budget — the budget-bounded
//! cooperative wait of the Stage 4.HW handshake. The spawned stub reads
//! `arg(1)`, resolves the well-known reply port name from `arg(2)` over the
//! production `port_resolve` syscall (refusing to proceed unless it names
//! the same endpoint), sends `DriverRegisterReply::registered(...)` over the
//! production `ipc_send` syscall (caller-context resolution, copy-in from
//! its own isolated address space, capability-gated `Port::send`), and
//! exits. PASS once the decoded reply round-trips the stub's pinned handle;
//! any shortfall (spawn failure, missing or malformed reply, drained
//! workload without a reply) writes a distinct failure finisher or times out
//! (fail-loud).
