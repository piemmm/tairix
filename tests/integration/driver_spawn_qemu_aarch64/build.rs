//! Build-time fixture generator for the `PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW aarch64
//! driver-spawn vertical.
//!
//! Three jobs on the freestanding `aarch64-unknown-none` target:
//!
//! 1. Hand the aarch64 `virt` linker script to the test kernel (the single
//!    per-board script the architecture port owns) and dump
//!    the canonical QEMU `virt` flattened device tree, embedding it so the test
//!    discovers the GICv2 base and the generic-timer rate from the firmware
//!    tree (`plans/PI.md` P3/P4). QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no
//!    DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`), so the board tree is embedded at build time; the
//!    dump helper lives in the shared harness so no aarch64 build script
//!    re-rolls it.
//! 2. Compile the pure-Rust driver-stub fixture program
//!    (`tests/integration/driver_register_program`) **position-independent**
//!    for the freestanding aarch64 target (the shared `program.ld` roots
//!    `tairix-rt`'s `_start`), into a private target directory under
//!    `OUT_DIR`.
//! 3. Convert the linked PIE ELF to an `rxe` blob, baking relocations for the
//!    [`tairix_itest_harness::USER_IMAGE_BIAS`] the production spawn producer
//!    maps every child image at and stamping the kernel's compiled-in syscall
//!    CFI tag (`tairix_kernel_syscall::SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH`) so
//!    [`tairix_abi::rxe::LoadImage::parse`] accepts it; emit the
//!    bytes and the bias as a Rust source the test `include!`s.
//!
//! On any non-aarch64 target (host `cargo build --workspace`, clippy) it emits
//! inert stubs so the crate still builds; the kernel body that consumes them
//! compiles only for the freestanding aarch64 target.
//!
//! Re-running `build.rs` produces byte-identical output, so the test is
//! deterministic.
