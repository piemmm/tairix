//! QEMU integration vertical: **open an application's window menu, see the
//! desktop's plate on screen, and choose a row** (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D17).
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! Every piece of menu *logic* is already covered by host unit tests: the
//! bounded wire model and its codec, the chain's plates, placement, grab,
//! traversal, dismissal and lifetime, the terminal's row model and its
//! id↔command inverse. What only a real machine can show is that those pieces
//! are **wired to each other and to the running application** — that a
//! secondary press on a client reaches the application as a pointer event,
//! that the `OpenMenu` it sends is served and accepted, that the session
//! actually *draws* a plate where the chain says it is, that a click on a row
//! is routed into the chain rather than to whatever is behind it, and that the
//! one `MenuClosed` answer reaches the application and runs the row's command.
//!
//! Before this vertical nothing on the system had ever put a plate on a screen.
//!
//! So the guest boots the **production** aarch64 pipeline
//! (`boot_aarch64::boot`) against a planted encrypted root carrying the signed
//! input and display driver bundles, and the host drives the desktop blind
//! through the QEMU monitor: unlock, log in, start the desktop, launch the
//! terminal from the program library, right-click its client, photograph the
//! plate, and click the *Settings…* row. Only the audit sink is swapped, for
//! the PASS witnesses below.
//!
//! # The PASS gate
//!
//! Three latches, in order, each attributable to exactly one act:
//!
//! 1. **The application launched.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming the bundle
//!    [`MENU_APP_NAME`] spells — the library row's own launch.
//! 2. **A menu was asked for and served.** A 12-byte
//!    `WINDOW_MINTED_ID_REPLY_LEN` reply on the reserved window endpoint,
//!    which is the reply of exactly one operation: `OpenMenu`.
//! 3. **A row's command reached the application.** A `WINDOW_CREATE_REPLY_LEN`
//!    reply observed *after* that one — the settings sheet the chosen
//!    *Settings…* row opens. The application is the only client in this world
//!    that creates a window (the desktop's own surfaces, the chain's plates
//!    included, are session-painted compositor windows that never call the
//!    window channel), and it opens that sheet on nothing but the
//!    `MenuOutcome::Chosen` naming that row. So the third latch attests the
//!    whole round trip: the press reached the client, the open was accepted, a
//!    chain came up, the click hit the row the chain had drawn, and the one
//!    answer the desktop owes was delivered back.
//!
//! Ordering is what makes each latch attributable. Counting creates from boot
//! would already be satisfied by the terminal's own launch window, so a create
//! only counts once the menu reply has been seen.
//!
//! # Why the guest latches no frame
//!
//! Reading the screen is the host's job and is gated on the *session's* own
//! `WINDOW_SHOWN` and `MENU_SHOWN` announcements, because only the session
//! knows when a window's or a plate's pixels reached the display. Those records
//! are emitted by userland through `lib/log`, which reaches the kernel's
//! diagnostic sink and the serial line — not the audit sink this guest
//! installs — so the guest could not see them even if it wanted to.
//!
//! # Why the guest cannot exit early
//!
//! The sheet is opened by the script's final click, and the runner sends no
//! pointer step until every screendump it has already asked for has been taken
//! and parsed. So the create that completes the PASS cannot happen until the
//! plate's dump is safely on disk, and the guest can never exit out from under
//! the evidence.
//!
//! A panic before all three latches parks the CPU, the guest falls silent, and
//! the runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
