//! Stage 3c QEMU integration test: the riscv64 arch primitives drive the
//! *live* `kernel/sched` scheduler.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The remaining Stage-3 riscv64 deliverable wires the arch port's
//! `preempt` (timer + IPI) and `context` primitives into the
//! architecture-neutral `kernel/sched` scheduler — not the test-local
//! counting callbacks the `timer_preempt` / `ipi_smp` verticals use. This
//! binary exercises that wiring end to end on the `virt` board:
//!
//! 1. **Real context switch.** With interrupts still disabled, it seeds a
//!    second `tairix_arch_riscv64::context::TaskCtx` over a private
//!    stack and `switch`es into it; the inbound task records that it ran
//!    and `switch`es straight back, proving a bidirectional bare-metal
//!    task switch round-trips.
//! 2. **Live scheduler.** It builds a real
//!    `tairix_kernel_sched_mlfq::Scheduler` over the arch port's
//!    `tairix_arch_riscv64::RiscvArch`, publishes it, and installs the
//!    `preempt` timer callback **and** the IPI software-interrupt callback
//!    so both drive `Scheduler::on_timer_tick`.
//! 3. **Timer + IPI + dispatch.** It installs the trap vector, enables the
//!    IPI and the 100 Hz SBI timer, spawns a batch of tasks, sends itself
//!    a directed IPI, and runs the cooperative `step` loop until every
//!    task has executed. It then waits until the supervisor-timer trap has
//!    driven `on_timer_tick` at least `MIN_PREEMPTIONS` times and
//!    the IPI software-interrupt path has driven the scheduler at least
//!    once, then writes the `SiFive` Test PASS finisher.
//!
//! A regression in any wired path (no context switch, no dispatch, no
//! timer tick, no IPI delivery) either trips a dedicated failure finisher
//! or never reaches the PASS write, so the run fails loudly — by an
//! explicit failure code or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links the `tairix-arch-riscv64` port and the
//! `tairix-kernel-sched-mlfq` policy directly and supplies its own
//! `kernel_main`, so the wiring is
//! exercised without the full `kernel_core::kernel_main` init pipeline
//! (which halts after boot and keeps its scheduler private). The
//! QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin, never behind a Cargo
//! feature on the arch crate (fail closed).
