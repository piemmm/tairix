//! x86_64 direct-physical-map QEMU integration test: the kernel reaches
//! **every** usable byte of a guest that has more RAM than the boot
//! trampoline's own identity window, and it reaches it in the kernel half
//! rather than in the half user programs address.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The kernel reaches a frame by pointer through the port's direct physical
//! map — the process-image write, the shared-region zero-on-free scrub, the
//! remap window's record store, the kernel heap's slab page supply. That map
//! used to be a fixed window sized before the firmware memory map was read,
//! so on a machine with more RAM than the window every frame above it
//! translated to nothing and its consumer failed closed while gigabytes sat
//! free (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D55). Nothing caught it, because every
//! other x86_64 guest in the matrix is small enough to fit the window.
//!
//! It was then an *identity* map in the low half, which every process root
//! had to carry, so it had to stop short of the user image bias and a
//! machine with more RAM than that had frames the kernel could not reach
//! (D56). Both halves of that are what this vertical now watches.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The guest is given more RAM than the trampoline's window, so the firmware
//! map reports usable RAM above it. Then:
//!
//! 1. The boot path sized the map past the trampoline's own window — proof
//!    it read the discovered map rather than a build-time constant.
//! 2. The early-boot RAM self-test left **no** usable byte unreachable: each
//!    one was written and read back through the direct map. A frame the map
//!    does not cover is left untested and counted, so a map that stopped
//!    short shows up here rather than as a silent skip.
//! 3. The live structure holds: a frame is reachable through the map while
//!    the user virtual address that would alias it under an identity map
//!    holds an *unrelated* mapping, the two lie in disjoint root slots, and
//!    a process root maps that frame's bare physical address to nothing.
//!    That collision is what capped the map at the user bias, and it is
//!    checked on the metal under a live root rather than only on the host.
//!
//! Only when all three hold does `BootCompleted` report success to QEMU.
//!
//! ## How it differs from the production `tairix-kernel` binary
//!
//! It reuses the whole boot pipeline from `tairix_kernel::boot`; only the
//! sink is replaced. Splitting the observer into its own bin (rather than
//! gating it behind a Cargo feature on `tairix-kernel`) keeps feature
//! unification under `cargo build --workspace` from ever leaking the
//! QEMU-exit behaviour into a real kernel image.
