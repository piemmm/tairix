//! QEMU integration test: a sandboxed SVG decode draws glyphs a live `fontd`
//! supplied over the parser-sandbox pipe (`plans/SVG.md` S23/S24).
//!
//! The production aarch64 boot pipeline runs unchanged — bootstrap-floor
//! virtio-MMIO discovery, the unlock kthread, the encrypted `ARXFS` root,
//! driver autoload, the display service and the console login — and only
//! the diagnostic sink is swapped for the gate. The host unlocks the root,
//! logs in as the seeded fixture account, and types the `svgtext` fixture's
//! command word.
//!
//! Nothing waits for the font service. It is registered on-demand, so the
//! fixture's own first glyph request activates it and the service manager
//! holds that call until the endpoint is answerable
//! (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-5). A script that gated on a readiness
//! line would be proving its own ordering rather than the system's.
//!
//! # What only a running machine can show
//!
//! Every layer of the text path is host-tested — the wire form and its
//! refusals, the service's resolution and synthesis, the layout, the
//! two-round exchange, and the decoder's own `<text>` drawing — and the
//! build-time icon verification already drives the real service. What no
//! host test reaches is the **pipe between them**: a decoder holding no
//! capability recording the faces and scalars it cannot answer, a parent
//! fetching exactly those from a live service, and a second decode drawing
//! the outlines that came back, all under a real kernel with real processes
//! and real spawn/pipe/wait.
//!
//! # Why the gate listens on the diagnostic trail, not the audit trail
//!
//! The measurement is a *userland* one: only the fixture can see the pixels
//! its sandbox produced, and a freestanding test kernel cannot issue
//! userland IPC. The fixture re-emits what it measured through `log_emit`,
//! which the kernel decodes into a typed record and delivers to the
//! **diagnostic** sink. So the gate is installed there and the audit trail
//! goes to the finisher, which holds the PASS until the scripted shell's own
//! `exit` — so the record provably reached the transcript before the run
//! ended. Everything either sink sees is replayed to serial first.
//!
//! # What the guest attests
//!
//! One measured record that `tairix_test_svgtext::Report::verdict` accepts
//! (plain backticks, not a link: the fixture crate is an aarch64-only
//! dependency and the host doc build has no such item to resolve): two drawings differing in exactly one character inked
//! differently and in the direction their characters do, neither blank and
//! neither a solid fill, and the same drawing through a sandbox with no font
//! seam refused for want of glyphs. Nothing but real, character-dependent
//! outlines fetched from the service satisfies all of that — a decoder
//! drawing nothing, a placeholder, or a fixed box fails it.
//!
//! # Failing loudly
//!
//! A refused measurement exits QEMU non-zero with its own code naming which
//! expectation it missed, and the record that produced it is already in the
//! transcript. A `svgtext` run that could not render at all says so in its
//! own record and the gate fails the run on sight of it, rather than waiting
//! out the budget. A panic parks the CPU, the guest falls silent, and the
//! runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
