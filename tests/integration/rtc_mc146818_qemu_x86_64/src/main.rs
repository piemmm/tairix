//! `plans/TIMESYNC.md` TS-3 QEMU integration test: boot the production
//! x86_64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline against the shared `rtc-root` whole-disk
//! image — whose read-only `/System` volume carries the **kernel-signed CMOS
//! clock-chip driver bundle** and no other driver — and prove the wall clock
//! is established from the machine's own clock chip.
//!
//! ## What this vertical asserts
//!
//! * The chain end to end: discovery synthesises the `motorola,mc146818`
//!   node with its `0x70`/`0x71` port pair on the legacy-fallback path,
//!   `devmgr` matches its bind table against the signed bundle in the store
//!   and autoloads it into its own user-space process, the driver reads its
//!   registers through the granted-range `PORT_READ` trap and binds the
//!   well-known RTC service endpoint, and `timed` — the sole holder of
//!   `CAP_TIME_SET` — reads it and tags the reading `Firmware`.
//! * That it happens **with no network and before the operator unlocks
//!   anything**: the store carries no NIC driver and the run types nothing at
//!   the passphrase prompt, so a clock established here can only have come
//!   from the chip.
//! * That the reading is *right*, not merely present. QEMU starts the CMOS
//!   clock at the pinned instant the harness passes on its command line, so
//!   the witness requires the applied seconds to land in the shared
//!   clock-chip fixture's window. A BCD/binary confusion, a 12-hour field
//!   read as 24, a wrong register, or a fabricated epoch is still a plausible
//!   wall time and would pass a bare "a clock was set" gate; none of them
//!   lands in this one.
//!
//! ## How it differs from its two siblings
//!
//! `rtc_pl031_qemu_aarch64` and `rtc_goldfish_qemu_riscv64` read a
//! memory-mapped counter off a device-tree node. This port has neither: the
//! CMOS clock is an index/data **port pair** no ACPI table enumerates, so it
//! is the only clock in the class reached through the user-space port-I/O
//! trap, and the only one whose node is synthesised rather than parsed. The
//! disk it boots is also reached over virtio-**PCI** rather than the
//! single-aperture MMIO transport.
//!
//! ## How the run completes
//!
//! The guest exits on `timed`'s `RTC_CLOCK_SET` audit record carrying an
//! in-window `wall_secs=`. There is deliberately **no serial script**: the
//! witness fires before the unlock prompt is answered, so a script gated on
//! the unlock or login dialogue would still be pending when the guest exits
//! and the runner would report it unfinished. A run that never earns the
//! witness fails loud on the runner's inactivity/absolute deadline.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline unchanged. The only
//! difference is that it is a dedicated test bin carrying the QEMU-exit
//! witness — there is no in-kernel exit shortcut to leak into a production
//! build (fail closed).
