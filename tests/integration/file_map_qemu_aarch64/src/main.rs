//! M1 QEMU integration test: prove the production demand-paged file-mapping
//! path end to end on the aarch64 `virt` board
//! (`docs/src/architecture/memory.md` §7o).
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the
//! embedded `virt` device tree, brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2, and
//! installs the **production** `KernelDispatchHook` through a
//! `DispatchCallbackSlot` — with the production `LiveMemMap` producer wired
//! for both `mem_map` and `file_map`, a read-only in-guest filesystem double
//! serving one fixture file, a real `KernelProcessWait`, a `ProgramRegistry`
//! carrying the three child roles, and the production user-fault resolver
//! bound to the same slot. The parent role of the fixture program
//! (`tests/integration/file_map_program`) is spawned through the production
//! `InitSpawnCtx::spawn_driver_process` seam; it drives the children through
//! the production `spawn` + `wait` syscalls:
//!
//! * `verify` demand-faults the mapping's first byte, an interior page, and
//!   the end-of-file straddle page (file bytes + zero fill verified), proves
//!   the mapping survives `fs_close`, hands an **untouched** mapped page to
//!   `fs_open` as its path buffer (the syscall copy-path fault-resolution
//!   proof), unmaps, and exits 0;
//! * `wild` maps, unmaps, and reads the unmapped base — the parent observes
//!   exit 139 through `wait` (the fault-kill path);
//! * `store` maps, faults a page resident, and stores to it — the read-only
//!   write-fault gate kills it, exit 139.
//!
//! The chassis reaps the parent through the wait producer's non-blocking poll;
//! PASS fires only on a parent exit of 0. Any child or parent misbehaviour
//! surfaces as a distinct failure finisher (the parent's diagnostic exit code
//! is folded into the finisher), and a wedged run times out through the harness
//! (fail-loud).
