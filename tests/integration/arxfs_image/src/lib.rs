//! Single-source-of-truth arxfs disk-image fixture shared by the
//! end-to-end QEMU arxfs-over-virtio_blk vertical.
//!
//! Unlike the hand-built FAT32 fixture, this image is laid down by the
//! **real** arxfs driver: [`build_image`] formats an in-memory volume
//! through [`ARXFS::format`](tairix_drv_fs_arxfs::ARXFS::format), plants
//! [`PLANTED_FILE_NAME`] / [`PLANTED_FILE_CONTENT`] through the driver's
//! own write path, and returns the resulting bytes. The on-disk layout
//! therefore has exactly one author — the driver — so the fixture and the
//! driver can never drift.
//!
//! The host harness (`tools/xtask`) plants those bytes on the test's
//! backing disk before the guest boots. The freestanding guest tail
//! (`tests/integration/virtio_qemu_support`) mounts that very volume
//! through the real arxfs driver, verifies the planted file, then
//! creates and writes a fresh file and reads it back. Both sides name the
//! same fixed files through the constants below, so the on-disk contract
//! lives in exactly one place.
//!
//! The image is a genuine arxfs volume — 1 MiB, 512-byte blocks, 64
//! inodes — laid out so the real `ARXFS::open` validator accepts it. It
//! is `no_std` + `alloc` so it links into both the host build tool and
//! the freestanding guest test.
