//! `plans/USB.md` U1 QEMU integration test: prove the kernel **driver-unload**
//! mechanism end to end on the aarch64 `virt` board.
//!
//! The build script compiles the pure-Rust driver-stub program
//! (`tests/integration/driver_register_program`) position-independent and
//! wraps it as the signed payload of a `kind = UserSpace` driver image. On
//! boot the test discovers the board from the embedded `virt` device tree,
//! enables the identity MMU + EL1 vectors, builds the live kernel registries
//! (frame allocator, scheduler, capability table, address-space registry, IRQ
//! table), and autoloads the stub through the production
//! `DeviceManager::autoload` + `SpawnDriverLoader` + `InitCtxDriverProcessSpawn`
//! over the `Aarch64ProcessSpawn` image builder — the driver is admitted as a
//! parked **loading** task with its placeholder capability record minted (its
//! address space is built on the driver's own first slice, never run here).
//!
//! It then drives the production driver-unload seam,
//! `InitSpawnCtx::terminate_driver_process` (the mechanism the driver-store
//! server runs for `StoreRequest::Unload`), and asserts the driver task was
//! reaped (the scheduler's live-task count drops 1 → 0) and its capability
//! record and address-space entry reclaimed; a second unload of the now-gone
//! handle must fail closed with `NotFound` (the teardown is idempotent). PASS
//! once teardown reclaimed everything and the idempotent miss was observed;
//! any shortfall writes a distinct failure finisher (fail-loud).
