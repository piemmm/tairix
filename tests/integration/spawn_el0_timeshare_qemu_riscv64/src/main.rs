//! `plans/PI.md` stage RV-X2 QEMU integration test (riscv64 sibling of the
//! x86_64 X2 / aarch64 `SP2c` verticals): prove **two** U-mode tasks timeshare
//! one hart as *resumable user kthreads* on the riscv64 `virt` board under the
//! live scheduler over the RV1 park-safe trap path.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the generic-timer rate from the firmware device tree,
//! installs the trap vector + a syscall-dispatch callback, and builds **two**
//! hardware-isolated U-mode address spaces — each its own Sv39 page-table
//! hierarchy (two `PageTablePool`s + a shared frame pool) —
//! from the `rxe` fixture program through the production capability-checked,
//! audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, admitting each as a
//! resumable user kthread via `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread`. Each
//! task's `pre_resume` hook reactivates *its own* `satp` root
//! (`paging::activate_user_root`, the RV-X1 primitive) immediately before every
//! switch-in. The cooperative `Scheduler::step` loop drives both; the dispatch
//! callback maps each `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to
//! `tairix_kernel_core::reschedule_current`, so the two tasks ping-pong with the
//! dispatcher through real U-mode↔kernel context switches that park and resume
//! mid-handler, each on its own kernel stack (the RV1 park-safe path).
//!
//! PASS once both tasks yielded their full count and exited. A wrong drain
//! count, an unexpected syscall, or a stall trips a distinct `SiFive` Test
//! failure finisher or times out, so the run fails loudly — by a failure code
//! or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
