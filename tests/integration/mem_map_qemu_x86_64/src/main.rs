//! SPAWN stage `SP5b-2` QEMU integration test (x86_64 sibling): prove a
//! ring-3 process can obtain and release anonymous `RW` memory at runtime via
//! `abi-v1` on x86_64 (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5).
//!
//! Unlike the riscv64/aarch64 `mem_map` siblings — which stand up a minimal
//! self-contained test kernel — the x86_64 ring-3 transition needs the GDT
//! ring-3 selectors, the TSS, and `syscall`/`IA32_LSTAR` entry installed, so
//! this test boots the production `tairix-kernel` pipeline (exactly like the
//! sibling `tairix-test-spawn-program-qemu-x86_64`). That pipeline now also
//! installs the dedicated, error-code-aware page-fault entry
//! (`tairix_arch_x86_64::fault`), so the deliberate use-after-unmap `#PF` is
//! observable rather than fail-closed-and-opaque.
//!
//! On `AuditEvent::BootCompleted` the test enables `IA32_EFER.NXE`, installs a
//! `tairix_arch_x86_64::fault` observer, builds one hardware-isolated user
//! address space from the `rxe` fixture program through the production
//! capability-checked, audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller,
//! **retains it live**, and installs a `tairix_kernel_core::MemMap` producer
//! backed by `tairix_kernel_mem::map_anonymous` / `unmap_anonymous` over that
//! space and its frame pool. It then `iretq`s into the program directly
//! through `EnterUser::enter_user`; the dispatch callback routes the program's
//! `mem_map` / `mem_unmap` `syscall`s through the producer.
//!
//! The program maps an anonymous region (FIXED), writes and reads back a
//! pattern, unmaps it, then touches the released range — which must raise a
//! page fault the fault observer reports as PASS. Any shortfall (the program
//! returning a failure exit code, an unexpected syscall, or no fault) flips
//! `qemu_exit::exit_failure` or times out, so the run fails loudly.
