//! SPAWN stage `SP5b-2` QEMU integration test (riscv64 sibling): prove a
//! U-mode process can obtain and release anonymous `RW` memory at runtime via
//! `abi-v1` on the riscv64 `virt` board (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5).
//!
//! On boot the test stands up an Sv39 address space that identity-maps the
//! kernel and MMIO, activates it (`satp`), installs the trap vector, a
//! syscall-dispatch callback, and a fault handler. It builds one
//! hardware-isolated U-mode address space — its own Sv39 page-table hierarchy —
//! from the `rxe` fixture program through the production capability-checked,
//! audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, **retains it live**, and
//! installs a `tairix_kernel_core::MemMap` producer backed by
//! `tairix_kernel_mem::map_anonymous` / `unmap_anonymous` over that space and
//! its frame pool. It then `sret`s into the program directly through
//! `EnterUser::enter_user`; the dispatch callback routes the program's
//! `mem_map` / `mem_unmap` `ecall`s through the producer.
//!
//! The program maps an anonymous region (FIXED), writes and reads back a
//! pattern, unmaps it, then touches the released range — which must raise a
//! page fault the fault handler reports as PASS. Any shortfall (the program
//! returning a failure exit code, an unexpected syscall, or no fault) trips a
//! distinct `SiFive` Test failure finisher or times out, so the run fails
//! loudly — by a failure code or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
