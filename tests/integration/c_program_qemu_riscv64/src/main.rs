//! CCOMPAT stage CC5 QEMU integration test: spawn a genuinely C-compiled
//! program (clang object + crt0 + abi-sys staticlib) on the riscv64 `virt`
//! board and assert it exits `99` — i.e. every abi-v1 C-header check and both
//! syscall round-trips it performs succeed.
//!
//! On boot the test builds an Sv39 address space that identity-maps the kernel
//! and MMIO, activates it, installs the trap vector and a dispatch callback,
//! then calls the production capability-checked, audited spawn caller
//! (`tairix_kernel_core::spawn_and_enter`, gated on `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`) to
//! materialise the program's U-mode image — built from the `rxe` blob the
//! build script produced — and `sret` into it. The C program checks a Time64
//! value across the boundaries, an ipc header, and a sysinfo header, then
//! calls `cap_query` and `clock_get`; the dispatch callback services those two
//! syscalls (returning a known answer / sentinel) and finally asserts the
//! `exit` code is `99` before the `SiFive` Test PASS finisher.
