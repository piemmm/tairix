//! QEMU integration vertical: **launch an application that declares an
//! icon-bar presence, choose a row of the menu it declared from its bar
//! slot, and take that slot's declared default action**
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md`).
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! Every piece of icon-bar *logic* — the bounded menu model and its wire
//! encoding, the strip's layout and hit-testing, the menu's rows and marks,
//! the session's grouping of windows under their attested owner — is already
//! covered by host unit tests. What only a real machine can show is that
//! those pieces are **wired to each other and to the running application**:
//! that an application's `SetAppBar` declaration reaches the session holding
//! the authority, that the session gives its process a slot on the bar the
//! compositor scans out, that a right-click there opens the menu *that
//! application* declared, that choosing a row is delivered back to the
//! declaring process, and that a primary click there is delivered too
//! because the declaration said the application handles it.
//!
//! So the guest boots the **production** aarch64 pipeline
//! (`boot_aarch64::boot`) against a planted encrypted root carrying the
//! signed input and display driver bundles, and the host drives the desktop
//! blind through the QEMU monitor: unlock, log in, start the desktop, then
//! Library → the terminal's row → right-click its new bar slot → *New
//! window* → primary-click that same slot. Only the audit sink is swapped,
//! for the PASS witnesses below.
//!
//! # The PASS gate
//!
//! Two latches, each attributable to exactly one act:
//!
//! 1. **The application launched.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming the
//!    bundle [`BAR_APP_NAME`] spells — the library row's own launch.
//! 2. **Every window the script asks for was opened.**
//!    [`WINDOWS_OPENED`] create replies were served on the reserved window
//!    endpoint, recognised by the distinctive wire length that is unique to
//!    a create among that endpoint's replies. The application is the only
//!    client in this world that creates a window, so the three are its
//!    launch window, the *New window* row it was handed, and its slot's
//!    declared default action — one per act.
//!
//! The second latch attests the declaration itself, end to end and more
//! strongly than any reply-shape witness could: the session refuses to open
//! a menu for an application that declared none, it addresses a chosen row
//! only through the route the declaration recorded, and it delivers a
//! primary click to the application only where the declaration claimed it.
//! So the later windows prove the declaration was accepted, that the slot
//! was the declaring process's, and that both outcomes were delivered to it.
//!
//! # Why the guest latches no frame
//!
//! Reading the screen is the host's job and is gated on the *session's* own
//! `WINDOW_SHOWN` announcement, because only the session knows when a served
//! window's pixels reached the display. The guest deliberately claims
//! nothing about frames: on this endpoint a present, a blur change, a
//! retitle and a declaration all answer with the same four-byte status
//! reply, so recognising a present here would be a guess about how many
//! requests the application makes rather than a fact.
//!
//! # Why the guest cannot exit early
//!
//! The last window is opened by the script's final click, and the runner
//! sends no pointer step until every screendump it has already asked for has
//! been taken and parsed. So the create that completes the PASS cannot
//! happen until the last dump is safely on disk, and the guest can never
//! exit out from under the evidence.
//!
//! A panic before both latches parks the CPU, the guest falls silent, and
//! the runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
