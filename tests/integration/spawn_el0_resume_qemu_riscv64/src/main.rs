//! `plans/PI.md` stage RV-X1 QEMU integration test (riscv64 sibling of the
//! x86_64 X1 / aarch64 `SP2c` verticals): prove a **single** U-mode task can be
//! admitted as a *resumable user kthread* on the riscv64 `virt` board and
//! cooperatively park/resume under the live scheduler over the RV1 park-safe
//! trap path.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the generic-timer rate from the firmware device tree,
//! stands up an Sv39 address space that identity-maps the kernel and MMIO,
//! activates it (`satp`), and installs the trap vector + a syscall-dispatch
//! callback. It builds one hardware-isolated U-mode address space — its own
//! Sv39 page-table hierarchy — from the `rxe` fixture program through the
//! production capability-checked, audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image`
//! caller, and admits it as a resumable user kthread via
//! `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread`. The task's `pre_resume` hook
//! reactivates the task's own `satp` root (`paging::activate_user_root`, the
//! RV-X1 primitive) immediately before every switch-in. The cooperative
//! `Scheduler::step` loop drives it; the dispatch callback maps each
//! `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to `tairix_kernel_core::reschedule_current`, so the
//! task ping-pongs with the dispatcher through real U-mode↔kernel context
//! switches that park and resume mid-handler (the first exerciser of RV1's
//! park-safety on a user task).
//!
//! PASS once the task yielded its full count and exited. A wrong drain count,
//! an unexpected syscall, or a stall trips a distinct `SiFive` Test failure
//! finisher or times out, so the run fails loudly — by a failure code or by the
//! harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
