//! `plans/PI.md` stage RV-X3 QEMU integration test (riscv64 sibling of
//! `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` / `_x86_64`): prove the riscv64 runtime
//! `spawn` **concurrent producer** on the `virt` board.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the generic-timer rate from the firmware device
//! tree, installs the trap vector + a syscall-dispatch callback, and builds the
//! **parent** a hardware-isolated Sv39 U-mode address space from the `rxe`
//! fixture program through the production capability-checked, audited
//! `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, admitting it as a resumable user
//! kthread via `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread`. The cooperative
//! `Scheduler::step` loop drives it. The parent issues a real
//! `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`-gated `spawn` `ecall`; the dispatch callback routes it to a
//! riscv64 `ProcessSpawn` producer that builds the **child** (session) a fresh,
//! hardware-isolated Sv39 space **through the identity window without switching
//! the running parent's `satp`** and admits it **Ready** concurrently (the
//! cross-port equal of the `aarch64`/`x86_64` producers). The callback maps each
//! `yield`/`exit` `ecall` to `tairix_kernel_core::reschedule_current`, so the
//! parent and child timeshare the hart on their own kernel stacks (the RV1
//! park-safe path).
//!
//! PASS once the producer built the child and both the parent and the child
//! ran to `exit`. A failed spawn, an unexpected syscall, a wrong drain count,
//! or a stall trips a distinct `SiFive` Test failure finisher or times out, so
//! the run fails loudly — by a failure code or by the harness
//! `Outcome::Timeout`.
