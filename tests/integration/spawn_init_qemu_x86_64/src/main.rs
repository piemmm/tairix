//! `plans/PI.md` X3a QEMU integration test (x86_64 port): boot the production
//! `tairix-kernel` pipeline, spawn PID 1 (`init`) into **ring 3**, and prove
//! it runs there — the cross-port sibling of the aarch64
//! `spawn_init_qemu_aarch64` (P6c-3).
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! `tairix_kernel::boot` installs the x86_64 PID 1 spawn seam
//! (`init_spawn_x86_64`, through `BootInfo::with_init`) and the COM1 console
//! backing (`BootInfo::with_consoles`). After `kernel_core::kernel_main` emits
//! `AuditEvent::BootCompleted` it builds `init`'s ring-3 image through the
//! capability-checked, audited spawn caller (emitting `AuditEvent::ProcessSpawned`,
//! `EventId(4030)`) and admits it as a resumable user kthread, then drains the
//! boot CPU's run queue. PID 1 `init` (`userland/system/init/src/run.rs`):
//!
//! 1. Writes its banner to fd 1 (`stream_write` over the COM1 backing). The
//!    write is *gated* — `init` parks fail-closed on a short write — so any
//!    later progress proves the banner fully landed.
//! 2. Issues the `spawn` syscall to launch its session. The x86_64 runtime
//!    `ProcessSpawn` producer is not wired yet (`plans/PI.md` X3b), so the
//!    fail-closed `NULL_PROCESS_SPAWN` rejects it (`NotImplemented`), `init`
//!    treats the negative result as a failed launch, and the runtime routes
//!    its return through the `exit` syscall — an audited `SyscallInvoked`
//!    (`EventId(5000)`).
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on a spawn + an audited syscall
//!
//! The `ProcessSpawned` record (`EventId(4030)`) proves the kernel built PID
//! 1's ring-3 image; the audited `SyscallInvoked` (`EventId(5000)`, PID 1's
//! `exit`) proves PID 1 actually executed in ring 3, made its gated banner
//! write land, and trapped back into the kernel through the `syscall` entry
//! path landing on PID 1's own kernel stack (the X1 durable user-`%rsp` save +
//! per-task `kernel_rsp0`). `init`'s `exit` is reached only *after* the gated
//! banner landed and the (rejected) `spawn` returned, so it is a sufficient
//! witness. A regression that never reaches ring 3 (a bad image, a fault on
//! entry, an unhandled first `syscall`) never emits the audited syscall, so
//! the run times out and the harness reports `Outcome::Timeout` — the
//! documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## How it differs from the production binary
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline — including the
//! `with_init` seam and the COM1 console — and only replaces the audit sink.
//! Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin (instead of a
//! Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature unification from
//! leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
