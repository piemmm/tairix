//! `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D82 QEMU integration test: a live, scheduled
//! kthread running on a **window-backed** kernel stack takes a synchronous
//! store page fault the instant it overruns into the stack's guard slot.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! A kthread kernel stack is a run of pages in the shared kernel remap
//! window whose lowest slot is reserved but never mapped. Because that
//! window's sub-hierarchy is installed by every translation root, the guard
//! is absent everywhere at once — nothing refines a live leaf, and no root
//! carries a per-task unmap. This vertical proves the payoff on the `virt`
//! board: an *overrunning kthread* faults synchronously in hardware rather
//! than being caught at its next reschedule by the software-canary
//! `tairix_kernel_core::kthread::BoxStack` fallback.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! 1. Reserve the kernel remap window, build a stage-1 identity space (which
//!    installs the window's shared slots), and turn paging on.
//! 2. Install the window-backed kthread stack tier over that window and draw
//!    one stack from it — the production allocation path.
//! 3. The drawn stack's usable run is mapped and writable, and its guard
//!    slot lies one page below the usable base.
//! 4. Admit a kthread on that stack through the live
//!    `tairix_kernel_sched_eevdf::Scheduler` via `spawn_kthread_with_stack`.
//! 5. The body writes the highest byte of its guard slot — the first byte a
//!    contiguous downward overrun crosses — and the unmapped slot raises a
//!    store page fault while the kthread is running.
//! 6. The handler confirms the cause and `stval` name exactly that slot and
//!    reports PASS. A slot left mapped lets the body return; the cooperative
//!    `step` loop drains and the test reports FAILURE rather than passing.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links the `tairix-kernel-core` kthread runtime, the
//! `tairix-arch-riscv64` port, and the default `tairix-kernel-sched-eevdf`
//! policy directly and supplies its own `kernel_main`, installing the window
//! and the stack tier itself rather than booting the whole pipeline. The
//! QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin, never behind a Cargo
//! feature on a library crate (fail closed).
