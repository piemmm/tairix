//! `plans/STRESSTEST.md` ST5 QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, log in as the seeded `root` account,
//! run the reported oversubscribed detached **`stress`** command under its full
//! 120-second timeout, and prove the shell and `sysmon` remain interactive
//! while all four CPUs are saturated.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The production boot path unlocks and mounts the encrypted `ARXFS`
//! root, login authenticates `root`/`root`, and the session shell runs the
//! runner's ordered script:
//!
//! 1. After the authenticated shell prompt appears, the runner waits one
//!    second and types exactly
//!    `stress --cpu 10 --timeout 120s --background`. The command-level detach
//!    path respawns a quiet controller and returns the shell prompt.
//! 2. The returned prompt must accept `sysmon`. Its `Pressure:` frame must
//!    render while all CPUs are saturated; `r` must refresh to the
//!    `reclaimable` panel, and `q` must return to the shell. This proves
//!    timer-driven preemption, input delivery, IPC, and the system-information
//!    service all progress while CPU workers issue no syscalls.
//! 3. After `sysmon` returns, the script types `true` at the prompt it
//!    restored: the shell must still accept and run a command. The shell is
//!    not exited — logging out ends the login's session, and with it the
//!    detached run (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`), which must instead
//!    complete.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on two `stress` exits *and* `true`'s exit
//!
//! `--background` creates two `comm=stress` audited exits: the foreground
//! launcher after it has spawned the detached controller, then the detached
//! controller after the full load and teardown. Workers are ended by
//! `Terminate` and never invoke `exit`. PASS requires all three witnesses —
//! both `comm=stress` exits and the scripted `comm=true` exit — and fires
//! once the *last* of them is observed, in **any** order: the command typed
//! after the monitor and the controller's 120-second end are concurrent, so
//! keying PASS on a fixed arrival order would race. The events each prove
//! their property: the two stress exits that the full load spawned, pinned,
//! dispatched, timed out, reaped and summarised; `true`'s that the console
//! stayed interactive enough to run a command under load. A refused spawn,
//! unresponsive console, failed teardown, or hung controller leaves a
//! witness unreached and the run fails loud by timeout.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`),
//! so the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build
//! time (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which
//! discovers the board from it exactly as it would from real firmware.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces
//! the audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate
//! bin (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production
//! build (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does
//! next).
