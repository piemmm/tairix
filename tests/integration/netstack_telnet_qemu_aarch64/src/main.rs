//! `plans/TELNET.md` QEMU integration test: boot the *production* aarch64
//! `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted whole-disk
//! encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the harness-side
//! **telnet-server** peer on its `dgram` netdev, then prove the RFC 854
//! client end to end over the live two-process network — the `telnet` command
//! process, the network stack, and the virtio-net driver each in its own
//! address space.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the shared net-tool encrypted-root fixture whose
//! read-only `/System` volume carries the **standard** signed store bundles —
//! including the real `telnet` command bundle, discovered from
//! `userland/apps/telnet` by the same `tools/xtask` composer as every other
//! bundle — **plus** the signed virtio-net driver bundle (so `devmgr`
//! autoloads it into its own process and `netstack` binds it). It plants no
//! test-only fixture: `telnet` is a shipping tool, exercised exactly as a user
//! would run it.
//!
//! The runner unlocks the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates
//! `root`/`root` at the console login, and types `telnet fe80::2` at the shell
//! — the host peer's link-local address, formed from the shared wire
//! identifier, with **no** port operand so the tool's own default port is what
//! is exercised. The store-then-`PATH` resolution finds
//! `/System/Commands/telnet.app/Run`, the disk-backed spawn path verifies the
//! signed bundle, and the tool runs with `manifest ∩ administrator-ceiling`
//! authority (`CAP_NET` for the stream socket, `CAP_CONSOLE_READ` for the
//! raw-mode relay), retrying `connect` through the boot window while the NIC
//! driver is still autoloading.
//!
//! ## Why the serial gates are a proof, not a reachability check
//!
//! Three markers stand between the connection and the PASS, each of which a
//! merely-connected client cannot produce:
//!
//! * The peer's banner is sent **only** after the client accepted `DO SUPPRESS
//!   GO AHEAD`, named its terminal type, reported its window size over NAWS,
//!   agreed `WILL LINEMODE`, stated an RFC 1184 `MODE` mask, and exported its
//!   SLC table. A client that connected but ignored the negotiation never sees
//!   it, so the script never types the next line and the run times out
//!   fail-loud with the transcript.
//! * The peer's upper-cased answer to the probe line the script then types
//!   proves the bytes made a full round trip through the telnet data path in
//!   both directions. The client's own local echo of the probe is lower case,
//!   so it cannot be mistaken for the answer.
//! * The escape character `^]` and the interpreter's `quit` are what end the
//!   session, so the escape recognition and the `telnet>` command interpreter
//!   are exercised on the live wire and the tool exits of its own accord
//!   rather than being killed.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the tool's exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! `telnet` exits when the operator quits, which the script does only after
//! the echoed answer appeared — but its exit alone still does not prove the
//! transcript carried that answer before the run ended. So the guest audit
//! sink arms on the tool's own audited `exit` (`SyscallInvoked`,
//! `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=telnet`) and reports PASS on the **next**
//! audited `exit` — the shell's. The harness additionally requires the host
//! peer's own verdict, which names the first negotiation step the client
//! failed to complete, so neither side can pass alone.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
