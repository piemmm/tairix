//! WIRING Stage W7 QEMU integration test: the aarch64 arch primitives
//! drive the *live* `kernel/sched` scheduler.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W7 requires the aarch64 port's `preempt`
//! (generic timer + GICv2 IPI) and `context` primitives to drive the
//! architecture-neutral `kernel/sched` scheduler — not the test-local
//! counting callbacks the `timer_preempt` / `ipi_smp` verticals use.
//! This binary exercises that wiring end to end on the `virt` board, the
//! EL1/GICv2 analogue of `sched_drive_qemu_riscv64`:
//!
//! 1. **Real context switch.** With interrupts still disabled, it seeds a
//!    second `tairix_arch_aarch64::context::TaskCtx` over a private stack
//!    and `switch`es into it; the inbound task records that it ran and
//!    `switch`es straight back, proving a bidirectional bare-metal task
//!    switch round-trips.
//! 2. **Live scheduler.** It builds a real
//!    `tairix_kernel_sched_mlfq::Scheduler` over the arch port's
//!    `tairix_arch_aarch64::Aarch64Arch`, publishes it, and installs the
//!    `preempt` generic-timer callback **and** the GICv2 IPI (SGI)
//!    callback so both drive `Scheduler::on_timer_tick`.
//! 3. **Timer + IPI + dispatch.** It installs the EL1 vector table and
//!    GICv2, enables the IPI SGI and the 100 Hz generic timer, unmasks
//!    IRQs, spawns a batch of tasks, sends itself a directed IPI, and
//!    runs the cooperative `step` loop until every task has executed. It
//!    then waits until the generic-timer IRQ has driven `on_timer_tick`
//!    at least `MIN_PREEMPTIONS` times and the IPI SGI path has driven
//!    the scheduler at least once, then writes the ARM semihosting PASS
//!    finisher.
//!
//! A regression in any wired path (no context switch, no dispatch, no
//! timer tick, no IPI delivery) either trips a dedicated failure finisher
//! or never reaches the PASS write, so the run fails loudly — by an
//! explicit failure code or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
//!
//! ## Discovered GICv2 base + timer rate (PI Stage P4)
//!
//! Before `gic::init`, the boot core **poisons** the runtime GICv2 base
//! and then reads the GICD/GICC bases from the canonical `virt` device
//! tree embedded at build time (`gic::configure_from_fdt`), asserting the
//! base moved off the poison value to the `virt` GICv2 distributor base.
//! The generic-timer frequency that sizes the 100 Hz tick interval is
//! likewise taken from the tree via `kernel_arch::timer_frequency_hz`
//! (the `/timer` `clock-frequency` override when present, else
//! `CNTFRQ_EL0`). Every subsequent GIC access — `gic::init`, the timer
//! PPI enable, the directed SGI — targets that discovered base, so the
//! timer + IPI ticks that drive the live scheduler are the runtime proof
//! the discovered base and rate work (`plans/PI.md` P4). The board tree
//! is embedded, not read from `x0`, because QEMU's ELF `-kernel` aarch64
//! boot hands the kernel no DTB pointer.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links the `tairix-arch-aarch64` port and the
//! `tairix-kernel-sched-mlfq` policy directly and supplies its own
//! `kernel_main`, so the wiring is exercised without the full
//! `kernel_core::kernel_main` init pipeline (which halts after boot and
//! keeps its scheduler private). The QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this
//! dedicated bin, never behind a Cargo feature on the arch crate
//! (fail closed).
