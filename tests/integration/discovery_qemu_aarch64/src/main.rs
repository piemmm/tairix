//! `plans/ZEROCONF.md` Z4 QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the
//! harness-side **multicast DNS responder** on its `dgram` netdev, then prove
//! link-local discovery end to end: `dns-sd` through `lib/discovery`, the
//! discovery channel, `discoveryd`'s front, and the capability-empty decoder
//! that parsed the peer's datagrams.
//!
//! The disk is the shared net-tool fixture — the **standard** signed store
//! bundles, so the real `dns-sd` command and the `discoveryd` service PID 1
//! starts at boot are present, plus the signed virtio-net driver. It plants no
//! test-only bundle.
//!
//! ## Why the serial gates are a proof
//!
//! The runner types three lookups, each only once the one before printed what
//! the peer published: a browse of the peer's type (gated on the instance
//! label), a resolve of that instance (gated on its `SRV` target and port), and
//! a lookup of that host (gated on its address). None of those strings is in
//! any line typed before it, so only an answer that crossed the whole path can
//! print it.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the lookups' exits *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! The audit sink counts the three `dns-sd` exits and reports PASS on the
//! **next** audited `exit` — the shell's, typed only after the last marker
//! appeared, so every answer provably reached the transcript first.
//! `discoveryd`'s own start records reach the transcript for diagnosis; the
//! answers subsume them, since none can be printed without the service and its
//! decoder. The harness also requires the peer's verdict that the guest asked
//! the wire for every record the lookups need, so neither side can pass
//! alone.
