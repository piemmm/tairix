//! QEMU integration test: hold the graphical desktop to its icon artwork
//! while the machine is under real memory pressure
//! (`plans/SMARTRAM.md`, `plans/ICONS.md`).
//!
//! The production aarch64 boot pipeline runs unchanged — bootstrap-floor
//! virtio-MMIO discovery, the unlock kthread, the encrypted `ARXFS` root,
//! driver autoload, the display service and the desktop session — and only
//! the audit sink is swapped for the PASS witnesses. The host logs in as the
//! seeded fixture account, starts the desktop, launches the terminal from the
//! program library, and then clicks its icon-bar slot once per further
//! window, each click gated on the session's own witness that the previous
//! window reached the screen.
//!
//! # What the guest attests
//!
//! Three facts, all three required, none of them inferable from the others:
//!
//! 1. **The application launched** — an `APP_LOADED` record naming the
//!    terminal's bundle in the system application store.
//! 2. **The machine really was under pressure** — the system pressure gauge's
//!    published band left normal at least once. Read through the kernel's own
//!    diagnostics registry, so the test observes the production gauge rather
//!    than steering it: there is no test hook in the pressure path, and a run
//!    that never left normal cannot pass.
//! 3. **The desktop kept serving windows there** — a create reply served on
//!    the reserved window endpoint *after* the band moved. A create is
//!    recognised by its reply's wire length, which is unique among that
//!    endpoint's replies; nothing about a reply's ordinal is read, because the
//!    rendezvous is shared.
//!
//! # What the host attests
//!
//! The pixels. The runner dumps the display on the first revealed desktop
//! frame and again the moment the guest reports the band leaving normal
//! (`PRESSURE_LEFT_NORMAL_MARKER`), and requires the icon bar to carry the
//! same artwork in both frames. A desktop that answered pressure by dropping
//! its decoded icons draws built-in glyphs in their place, so the two frames
//! diverge and the assertion fails — which is the defect this vertical exists
//! to keep fixed.
//!
//! The guest outlives that readback because a pending screendump holds every
//! later pointer step: the click that opens the window completing witness 3 is
//! the first one the runner releases once the frame has parsed.
//!
//! A panic before every witness is in parks the CPU, the guest falls silent,
//! and the runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
