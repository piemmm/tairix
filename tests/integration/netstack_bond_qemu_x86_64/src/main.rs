//! `plans/NETWORK.md` N9b-3-2-β-2-ii-b-bond QEMU integration test: boot the
//! production x86_64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline against the shared
//! `bond-net-root` whole-disk image — whose always-readable `/System` volume
//! carries the **kernel-signed virtio-net driver bundle** (cross-compiled for
//! x86_64) and a planted `/System/Settings/Network/network.conf` composing an
//! **active-backup bond** over two NICs — with **two** `virtio-net-pci`
//! devices attached and the harness-side **bond** link peer serving both
//! wires, and prove live link-aggregation **failover** end to end over the
//! x86_64 virtio-**PCI** + MSI-X device-IRQ path.
//!
//! ## What this vertical asserts — and how it differs from its siblings
//!
//! * The static-addressing vertical proves the declarative bind + static
//!   address path over a *single* NIC. This vertical proves **bonding and
//!   failover** on top of it: `netstack` composes an active-backup bond
//!   (`wan`) over two NICs bound by `match.mac`, assigns the *bond* a static
//!   IPv6 address, and answers the peer over the active member. Mid-flow the
//!   harness drops the **primary** member's carrier over the QEMU monitor
//!   (`set_link net0 off`); the driver's virtio config-change interrupt
//!   reports the link down, the bond fails over to the surviving member, and
//!   the guest keeps answering — now over the second wire.
//! * `netstack_bond_qemu_aarch64` proves the same failover over the
//!   virtio-**MMIO** bus. This is its x86_64 virtio-PCI sibling: the bond is
//!   bound by `match.mac`, so the config is arch-neutral and the only
//!   difference is that the two NICs and the failover live on the PCI bus.
//! * The failover is the whole point, so PASS requires an
//!   `INBOUND_ECHO_SERVED` that arrives **after** the `BOND_FAILOVER`: a
//!   request served only *before* the primary was dropped would not prove the
//!   flow survived, so the post-failover echo is a real discriminator, not a
//!   tautology.
//!
//! ## Why PASS keys on three ordered witnesses
//!
//! The log-sink observer reports PASS once it has seen all of (each a
//! userland `log_emit` record the kernel routes to the log sink):
//!
//! 1. `netstack`'s `BOND_CONFIG_APPLIED` — the planted bond `network.conf`
//!    was applied: two members enrolled, the active-backup bond composed, its
//!    static address assigned.
//! 2. `netstack`'s `BOND_FAILOVER` — the bond's transmit path changed after a
//!    member link report (the harness dropped the primary member's carrier
//!    and the driver's config-change interrupt reported it down). The bond's
//!    own bring-up is `BOND_UP`, a distinct event, so it cannot satisfy this
//!    witness however the admission sweep and the address's DAD happen to
//!    interleave — otherwise the guest could exit before the harness had
//!    dropped anything.
//! 3. `netstack`'s `INBOUND_ECHO_SERVED` **observed after witness 2** — an
//!    echo request addressed to the bond's static address was answered *after*
//!    the failover, so a frame crossed the two-process boundary over the
//!    surviving member end to end.
//!
//! Witness 3 (post-failover) can only fire after 1 and 2, so the three
//! together prove the whole chain; it gates exit so the guest stays alive
//! until a frame has actually been served post-failover, avoiding a race with
//! the host peer's verdict. The harness additionally requires the peer
//! thread's own echo campaign (to the bond's static address) to have
//! completed, so neither side can pass alone.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline and only swaps in a
//! log-sink observer. Splitting the observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
