//! CCOMPAT stage CC3 QEMU integration test: spawn a separately-linked C-ABI
//! program (crt0 + abi-sys) on the aarch64 `virt` board and assert its `exit`
//! syscall carries the decimal argument it was spawned with.
//!
//! On boot the test builds a stage-1 address space that identity-maps the
//! kernel and MMIO (EL1), activates it, installs the EL1 vector table and a
//! dispatch callback, then calls the production capability-checked, audited
//! spawn caller (`tairix_kernel_core::spawn_and_enter`, gated on
//! `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`) to materialise the program's EL0 image — built from the
//! `rxe` blob the build script produced — and `eret` into it. The program
//! parses `argv[1]` and returns it; crt0 routes the return through the `exit`
//! syscall, whose `svc` traps back through the kernel EL1 vector to the
//! dispatch callback, which asserts the code equals the spawned argument
//! before the ARM semihosting PASS finisher.
