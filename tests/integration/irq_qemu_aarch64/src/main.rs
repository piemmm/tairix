//! WIRING Stage W3-B QEMU integration test: a device IRQ routed through
//! GICv2 SPI target-routing and the EL1 IRQ path reaches a Rust handler
//! and drives the kernel/irq mask-before-wake path on the aarch64 `virt`
//! board — the EL1/SPI analogue of `tests/integration/irq_qemu_x86_64`.
//!
//! On boot the test installs the EL1 vectors, brings up the GICv2, builds
//! a kernel-neutral `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable`, binds the PL031 RTC's
//! GICv2 SPI line (INTID 34), installs a set-once device-IRQ dispatcher
//! (`tairix_arch_aarch64::exceptions::set_device_irq_dispatch`) that
//! forwards the line to `IrqTable::fire` over a `GicController` bridge,
//! routes that SPI to CPU 0 (`gic::route_spi` → `GICD_ITARGETSR`), arms
//! the RTC match interrupt, and unmasks IRQs. When the RTC fires, the GIC
//! delivers the SPI to EL1, the dispatcher masks the line and sets the
//! wait flag, and the main loop observes `WaitStep::Ready`. It then
//! re-reads the GIC enable bit and asserts the line is masked — the
//! mask-before-wake evidence (`docs/src/security/irq.md`) — before
//! reporting PASS via ARM semihosting. A regression that fails to route,
//! deliver, or mask never reaches PASS, so the run times out (the
//! documented fail-loud behaviour).
