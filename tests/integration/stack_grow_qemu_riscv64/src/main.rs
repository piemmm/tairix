//! `SP11c` QEMU integration test: prove the demand-grown user stack end to
//! end on the riscv64 `virt` board — the riscv64 twin of
//! `stack_grow_qemu_aarch64` (`docs/src/architecture/memory.md` §7c).
//!
//! On boot the test reads the timebase from the live device tree OpenSBI
//! passed in `a1`, installs the S-mode trap vector, and installs the
//! **production** `KernelDispatchHook` through a `DispatchCallbackSlot` —
//! with the production `LiveMemMap` producer backing both `mem_map` and
//! the stack-growth fault path, a real `KernelProcessWait`, a
//! `ProgramRegistry` carrying the three child roles (their numeric
//! parameters derived from the one shared `spawn_layout` policy), and the
//! production user-fault resolver bound to the same slot (load *and*
//! store/AMO U-mode page faults). The parent role of the fixture program
//! (`tests/integration/stack_grow_program`) is spawned through the
//! production `InitSpawnCtx::spawn_driver_process` seam; it drives the
//! children through the production `spawn` + `wait` syscalls:
//!
//! * `grow` recurses far past the eagerly committed stack top — the run
//!   only completes if the fault-driven growth path backs every page — and
//!   verifies each frame's bytes survived, exiting 0;
//! * `limit` lowers its own `StackBytes` soft bound through `rlimit_set`
//!   and recurses past it — the parent observes exit 139 through `wait`
//!   (the audited `stack_limit` fault-kill);
//! * `guard` reads the unmapped guard page below the reserved span — the
//!   parent observes exit 139 (the guard stays the structural defence).
//!
//! The chassis reaps the parent through the wait producer's non-blocking poll;
//! PASS fires only on a parent exit of 0. Any child or parent misbehaviour
//! surfaces as a distinct failure finisher (the parent's diagnostic exit code
//! is folded into the finisher), and a wedged run times out through the harness
//! (fail-loud).
