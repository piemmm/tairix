//! `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D7 + D8 QEMU integration test: boot the production
//! x86_64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline with a planted whole-disk encrypted-root
//! image and prove the **virtio-blk-PCI MSI-X disk-completion interrupt**
//! drives the two-kthread admission path all the way through the interactive
//! encrypted-root unlock and the users-database install — the regression for
//! both the D7 triple fault (reaching the read-only `/System` mount) and the
//! D8 admission read stall (reaching the users-DB install).
//!
//! ## What this test asserts — and how it differs from its siblings
//!
//! * `root_unlock_login_qemu_x86_64` drives the interactive unlock
//!   **policy** *directly* over the planted disk from a boot-observer
//!   context that hijacks the boot CPU on `BootCompleted`, so the admitted
//!   unlock kthread never dispatches and the production MSI-X device-IRQ
//!   wake path is never exercised.
//! * `spawn_session_qemu_x86_64` boots the production pipeline with **no**
//!   disk, so `unlock_service::spawn_if_present` is a no-op.
//!
//! This vertical attaches the shared `tairix_test_encrypted_root_image`
//! whole-disk image as a virtio-blk-pci device and boots `boot_x86_64::boot`
//! verbatim. The production path discovers + binds the root, admits the
//! in-kernel root-unlock kthread, and that kthread brings the
//! virtio-blk-PCI device up over the production **MSI-X** path, mounts the
//! read-only `/System` volume, then — driven by the scripted passphrase on
//! COM1 — unlocks the encrypted user-data root and installs the users
//! database into `LATE_USERS_DB`. Reaching the install requires the disk's
//! completion MSI-X to be delivered on its dedicated vector and to wake the
//! scheduler-parked bring-up over **thousands** of block reads, with a
//! device IRQ preempting ring-3 services without corrupting the per-CPU GS
//! state — the exact path the D7 triple fault broke (an external-IRQ
//! stack-frame-offset bug ran an unbalanced `swapgs`; a shared IO-APIC-pin
//! vector modelled the edge MSI as a level line). The audit sink reports
//! PASS the instant it sees `USERS_DB_INSTALLED_MESSAGE`.
//!
//! A regression of the D7 fix triple-faults on the first disk read (before
//! any mount), so the message never appears and the harness fails loud.
//!
//! ## D8 — the admission read path terminates and installs
//!
//! The *interactive users-database install* over the encrypted root (the
//! scripted passphrase, decrypt, `LATE_USERS_DB` publish) is a strict
//! superset of the `/System`-mount witness and is what this vertical now
//! asserts. It is the two-kthread admission path — the interactive-unlock
//! kthread and the driver-store serve kthread sharing one boot disk through
//! the pressure-governed `BlockCache`/`SharedBlock` on a 256 MiB guest — that
//! D8 reported stalling with no forward progress. That stall is resolved (it
//! was a consequence of the pre-fix kernel-heap OOM/pressure condition the
//! `kernel/mem` `MAX_ORDER` growth + fallible-reserve read fix removed); the
//! admission install now completes deterministically, and this witness is the
//! regression that keeps it that way. The observer `root_unlock_login_qemu_x86_64`
//! drives the unlock policy directly on the boot CPU and so never exercises
//! this concurrent two-kthread path.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline and only replaces
//! the audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate
//! bin (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
