//! `plans/NEW-SUPERVISOR.md` §7 / `plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md` QEMU integration
//! test: the x86_64 sibling of `supervisor_esc_qemu_aarch64`. Boot the
//! production x86_64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline with a planted whole-disk
//! encrypted-root image, press **`ESC`** at the pre-mount boot screen to drop
//! into the in-kernel **pre-boot Supervisor** REPL, run a read-only command,
//! `continue` back to the normal unlock, and prove the resumed unlock still
//! mounts the encrypted `ARXFS` root.
//!
//! ## What this vertical asserts
//!
//! It exercises the ESC boot-screen contract end to end on the *production
//! boot path* — the same path `root_unlock_admission_qemu_x86_64` drives,
//! which already installs the real `SupervisorHost` and draws the boot screen
//! over COM1. The runner's serial script (`tools/xtask`
//! `SUPERVISOR_ESC_SCRIPT`, shared byte-for-byte with the aarch64 sibling)
//! walks the frozen, byte-exact screen states in order:
//!
//! 1. `[Press ESC for supervisor]` — the announcement
//!    (`root_mount::SUPERVISOR_ANNOUNCE`); the runner types a lone `ESC`.
//! 2. `Supervisor` — the enter banner
//!    (`root_mount::SUPERVISOR_ENTER_BANNER`, `\rARXFS\x1b[K\r\n\r\nSupervisor`)
//!    proving the collapse-to-`ARXFS`-then-`Supervisor` drop happened; the
//!    runner types `help` at the `*` prompt.
//! 3. `commands:` — the dispatcher's host-independent `Supervisor commands:`
//!    header, proving a real command ran inside the REPL; the runner types
//!    `continue`.
//! 4. `ARXFS passphrase: ` — the normal unlock prompt redrawn *after* the REPL
//!    exited, proving a Supervisor session is transparent to boot; the runner
//!    types the fixture passphrase.
//!
//! Reaching each marker in order is the byte-exact assertion (the run fails
//! loud if the guest exits before every scripted step was sent), and the PASS
//! witness below proves the resumed unlock completed.
//!
//! Because the ESC window and a lone `ESC` at the live passphrase prompt are
//! the *same* `enter_supervisor` drop, the vertical is robust to the 2-second
//! window race: if the announcement's timed window elapses before the scripted
//! `ESC` byte lands, that same `ESC` is read as the first byte of the
//! passphrase line and still drops into the Supervisor (`root_mount`
//! `PassphraseReadError::Escape`), so the `Supervisor` banner appears either
//! way and `continue` returns to the redrawn prompt in both cases.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the install message
//!
//! The audit sink reports PASS once it has seen the unlock-service
//! `USERS_DB_INSTALLED_MESSAGE` (`EventId(4139)`) — the witness that the
//! in-kernel unlock kthread mounted the encrypted `ARXFS` root and installed
//! the users database. That message can only be reached *after* the Supervisor
//! REPL returned via `continue` and the resumed unlock accepted the typed
//! passphrase, so the PASS proves the whole ESC → REPL → `continue` → unlock
//! round-trip. A run where `continue` never resumed the unlock, or the resumed
//! unlock never mounted, never reaches the message and the harness times out —
//! the documented fail-loud behaviour. The database *content* (that
//! `root`/`root` authenticates) is proven over the same shared fixture by
//! `root_unlock_login`, so this vertical keys on the install witness, not a
//! `login` success.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
