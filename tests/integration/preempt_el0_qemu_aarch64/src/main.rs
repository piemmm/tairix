//! `plans/PI.md` D2b-2b-A P-1 QEMU integration test: prove the production
//! generic-timer IRQ **involuntarily preempts** a runaway EL0 task on the
//! aarch64 `virt` board.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the embedded
//! `virt` device tree (`plans/PI.md` P3/P4), brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2,
//! and installs a syscall-dispatch callback. It builds one hardware-isolated
//! EL0 address space from the `el0_spinner` `rxe` fixture through the production
//! capability-checked, audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller and
//! admits it as a resumable user kthread (`spawn_user_kthread`).
//!
//! It then arms the **production** preemption path verbatim (the same `tairix_arch_aarch64::preempt` surface the bin crate's
//! `arm_preemption` uses): registers a per-CPU `PreemptStorage`, installs an
//! EL0-preemption callback that suspends the running task back to the scheduler
//! via `reschedule_current(_, Yield)`, and starts the periodic generic timer.
//! EL0 already runs preemptible (`userentry`'s `SPSR_EL0T_PREEMPTIBLE`), so a
//! timer tick taken while the spinner is in EL0 traps to the `LOWER_IRQ` vector
//! and drives the preempt point.
//!
//! Driving the `step` loop dispatches the spinner into EL0, where it busy-loops
//! issuing **no** syscall. Because the loop never traps, the *only* thing that
//! can return control to the dispatcher before the spinner's final `exit` is an
//! involuntary timer preemption. The test PASSes once (a) the preempt callback
//! fired at least once **and** (b) the task — correctly resumed mid-loop after
//! each preemption — still completed its spin and exited. A preemption that
//! never fires (the `step` never returns) or a botched resume (the task never
//! exits) stalls the drain, so the run fails loudly — by a failure code or by
//! the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
