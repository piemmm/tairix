//! `plans/NETWORK.md` N6b-2-β-2 QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the
//! harness-side active TCP client peer on its `dgram` netdev, then prove the
//! **server-side stream-socket** (`SocketType::Stream` listener) path end to
//! end over the live two-process network — server process, network stack, and
//! virtio-net driver each in its own address space. It is the role-swapped
//! mirror of `netstack_stream_qemu_aarch64` (which runs a guest *client*
//! against a host *echo server*).
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the shared encrypted-root fixture whose read-only
//! `/System` volume carries the standard signed store bundles **plus** the
//! signed virtio-net driver bundle (so `devmgr` autoloads it into its own
//! process and `netstack` binds it) **plus** the test-only `tcpserve` fixture
//! bundle (`tests/integration/tcpserve_program`), all composed and signed by
//! the same `tools/xtask` composer as every store bundle and planted only on
//! this vertical's disk — no production image ever ships the fixtures.
//!
//! The runner unlocks the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates
//! `root`/`root` at the console login, and types the bare command word
//! `tcpserve` at the shell: the store-then-`PATH` resolution finds
//! `/System/Commands/tcpserve.app/Run`, the disk-backed spawn path verifies the
//! signed bundle, and the server runs with `manifest ∩ administrator-ceiling`
//! authority (its manifest requests `CAP_NET` **and** `CAP_NET_BIND_PRIVILEGED`,
//! both enforced by the netstack socket dispatcher against the kernel-attested
//! origin). The server binds the well-known (privileged) port, listens,
//! accepts the host client peer's connection over the shared IPv6 link-local
//! wire, echoes every received byte back, and verifies the received run. The
//! peer injects bounded frame loss, so a passing run proves RFC 9293
//! retransmission carried the stream both ways across the two-process boundary
//! — not merely a clean link.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the server's exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! On a fully verified exchange the server prints its `TCPSERVE PASS …` line
//! and exits `0`; on **any** shortfall it prints the reason and parks forever
//! — it never exits — so the server's audited `exit` (`SyscallInvoked`,
//! `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=tcpserve`) is itself the kernel-side
//! witness of a verified exchange. Exiting QEMU on that record would tear the
//! run down before the runner observed the marker and sent its final line, so
//! the sink only *arms* there and reports PASS on the **next** audited `exit`
//! — the shell's, which the runner types only after the `TCPSERVE PASS` marker
//! appeared past the server's own output. The runner additionally fails the
//! run if the guest exits before every scripted marker appeared, and the
//! harness requires the client peer to report the whole transfer echoed and
//! verified, so neither side can pass alone. A refused bind (missing
//! `CAP_NET_BIND_PRIVILEGED`), a mismatched or truncated stream, or a server
//! crash therefore never reaches the armed exit: the run times out with the
//! diagnosis in the serial transcript — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
