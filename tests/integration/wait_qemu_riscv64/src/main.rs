//! `plans/PI.md` stage RV-X4 QEMU integration test (riscv64 sibling of
//! `wait_qemu_aarch64` / `_x86_64`): prove a parent U-mode task can `wait` on,
//! reap, and read back the exit code of its own child under the live scheduler
//! on the `virt` board.
//!
//! On boot the test reads the generic-timer rate from the firmware device
//! tree, installs the trap vector + a syscall-dispatch callback, and builds a
//! **child** and a **parent** hardware-isolated Sv39 U-mode address space from
//! the `rxe` fixture program (`tests/integration/wait_program`, built PIE in
//! both roles) through the production capability-checked, audited
//! `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, admitting each as a resumable user
//! kthread via `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread`. It records the
//! parent/child link with a `tairix_kernel_core::KernelProcessWait` producer and
//! drives the cooperative `Scheduler::step` loop. The dispatch callback routes
//! the child's `exit` and the parent's `wait`/`exit` `ecall`s through the
//! producer + `tairix_kernel_core::reschedule_current`: the producer parks the
//! parent until the child is reapable (the RV1 mid-handler-park-safe path),
//! then the kernel copies the reaped exit code out to the parent's `status`
//! pointer.
//!
//! PASS once the parent reaped the child, read back the agreed code, and exited
//! 0. A wrong code, a missing reap, an unexpected syscall, or a stall trips a
//! distinct `SiFive` Test failure finisher or times out, so the run fails
//! loudly — by a failure code or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
