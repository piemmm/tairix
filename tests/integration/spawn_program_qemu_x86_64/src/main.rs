//! CCOMPAT stage CC3 QEMU integration test: spawn a separately-linked C-ABI
//! program (crt0 + abi-sys) into **ring 3** on x86_64 and assert its `exit`
//! syscall carries the decimal argument it was spawned with.
//!
//! Unlike the riscv64/aarch64 spawn round-trips — which stand up a minimal
//! self-contained test kernel — the x86_64 ring-3 transition needs the GDT
//! ring-3 selectors, the TSS, and `syscall`/`IA32_LSTAR` entry installed, so
//! this test boots the production `tairix-kernel` pipeline (exactly like the
//! sibling `tairix-test-enter-user-qemu-x86_64`). On
//! `AuditEvent::BootCompleted` it enables `IA32_EFER.NXE`, builds a fresh
//! address space (low 32 MiB identity + the higher-half kernel window),
//! switches CR3, installs a dispatch callback, then calls the production
//! capability-checked, audited spawn caller
//! (`tairix_kernel_core::spawn_and_enter`, gated on `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`) to
//! materialise the program's ring-3 image — built from the `rxe` blob the
//! build script produced, with W^X leaf permissions (code RX, data RW-NX,
//! rodata R-NX) — and `iretq` into it. The program parses `argv[1]` and
//! returns it; crt0 routes the return through the `exit` syscall, whose
//! `syscall` traps back through the kernel's `IA32_LSTAR` entry stub to the
//! dispatch callback, which asserts the code equals the spawned argument
//! before `qemu_exit::exit_success`.
