//! PI P10 chunk 5d-0-ii (b′) fixture program: a minimal, separately-linked
//! pure-Rust EL0 program that exercises the `abi-v1` `mmio_map` syscall
//! (`plans/PI.md` 5d-0-ii (b′)-2).
//!
//! The consuming vertical (`tests/integration/mmio_map_qemu_aarch64`) builds
//! this program into a hardware-isolated EL0 address space, **retains that
//! space live** (the production `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_user_kthread_with_stack_live`
//! path), mints the calling task a device-resource grant for a real `virt`
//! virtio-MMIO transport window, and routes the program's `mmio_map` syscall
//! through the production owner-checked resolution + the retained-space
//! `tairix_kernel_mem::LiveSpace::map_device_window` mechanism. The program:
//!
//! 1. `mmio_map`s its granted device window by handle, proving the kernel
//!    resolved the grant for *this* task and mapped a real, caching-disabled
//!    device window into the program's own address space, returning its base
//!    virtual address.
//! 2. Reads the device's first register (the virtio-MMIO `MagicValue` at
//!    offset 0) through that base and checks it equals the expected magic —
//!    proving the window points at genuine device MMIO, not blank memory.
//! 3. Returns `0` (PASS) on a match, or a distinct non-zero code on any
//!    failure, which `tairix-rt` routes through `exit`; the vertical reports
//!    exit code `0` as PASS and any other as a failure.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: it links the Rust userland
//! runtime `tairix-rt`, never the C ABI (`crt0` + `abi-sys`), which exists
//! solely for non-Rust programs. It is built
//! position-independent and converted to an `rxe` blob by the consuming test's
//! build script. On the host it is an inert stub so
//! `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and fmt still cover the crate.
