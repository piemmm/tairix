//! S8b QEMU integration test: prove the `lib/sandbox` parser-sandbox seam
//! end to end on the aarch64 `virt` board
//! (`docs/src/security/sandbox.md`; `plans/APPS.md` S8b).
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the
//! embedded `virt` device tree, brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2, and
//! installs the **production** `KernelDispatchHook` through a
//! `DispatchCallbackSlot` — the production `LiveMemMap` producer for the
//! `tairix-rt` heap, a real `KernelProcessWait`, and a `ProgramRegistry`
//! carrying the fixture's parent and worker paths. The parent role of the
//! fixture program (`tests/integration/sandbox_program`) is spawned through
//! the production `InitSpawnCtx::spawn_driver_process` seam and drives the
//! seam over the real syscalls:
//!
//! * container and instruction decode of valid **and** malformed inputs
//!   through a genuinely sandboxed decode worker — its own binary spawned
//!   via `SpawnAttach::sandbox` over a pipe pair, branded capability-empty
//!   and confined to the sandbox allow-list by the S8a kernel primitive;
//! * real crash containment — a worker that exits without serving yields a
//!   typed `WorkerFailed`, a logged `EVENT_WORKER_CRASHED`, and a caller
//!   that goes on decoding through its healthy worker;
//! * the syscall wall from the inside — a probe worker's `fs_open` and
//!   `spawn` are refused inside the sandbox while its pipe reply crosses;
//! * the duplex session seam driven from a wait-set over both directions
//!   of a sandboxed worker's pipe pair, pushing twice a pipe's worth of
//!   frames at a worker that answers none of them — which completes only
//!   if the `StreamRoom` wake fires;
//! * the supervised session: a stream worker that dies through its panic
//!   path mid-conversation is reaped and logged, its replacement starts
//!   only once the paced delay has elapsed on a real one-shot wait, and the
//!   replacement serves on a fresh pipe pair.
//!
//! The chassis reaps the parent through the wait producer's non-blocking poll;
//! PASS fires only on a parent exit of 0. Any misbehaviour surfaces as a
//! distinct failure finisher (the parent's diagnostic exit code is folded into
//! the finisher), and a wedged run times out through the harness (fail-loud).
