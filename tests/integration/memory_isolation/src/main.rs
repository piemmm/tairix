//! Stage-2 QEMU integration test: hardware-enforced memory isolation.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! states that "Memory isolation is enforced by hardware
//! (page tables / MMU / WASM sandboxing). A process can only reach
//! another process's memory through an explicit, capability-checked
//! shared-memory IPC object." Stage 2 of `PLAN.md` (deliverable: "QEMU-
//! based integration tests for memory isolation: a test process
//! attempting to read another's memory must fault") makes that promise
//! concrete at the page-table layer.
//!
//! ## How it asserts it
//!
//! Two distinct `AddressSpace`s are constructed (`tairix_arch_x86_64`'s
//! Stage-3a-partial paging primitives — see that crate's docs):
//!
//! * **Victim** — identity-maps the first 32 MiB *and* adds a 4 KiB
//!   mapping at the secret virtual address (the first byte past the live
//!   identity window) pointing to a
//!   physical frame initialised with the byte `SECRET_BYTE`.
//! * **Attacker** — carries the live identity window only. The secret VA
//!   is not mapped at any level of the attacker's PML4.
//!
//! The boot CPU then:
//!
//! 1. Switches to the *victim* CR3, reads the secret VA, asserts the
//!    byte is intact (proves the mapping was actually set up).
//! 2. Switches to the *attacker* CR3 and reads the secret VA.
//! 3. The CPU raises `#PF` (vector 14) with `error_code = 0` (page
//!    not-present, supervisor mode, read). The port's boot tables route
//!    the fault through the fault-handler slot into `page_fault_handler`
//!    (below), which: (a) validates that the error
//!    code is exactly the not-present supervisor-mode read it expects
//!    (no other class of fault is acceptable); (b) validates that the
//!    *victim's* secret frame is still readable via its identity-mapped
//!    physical address — i.e. the attack did not corrupt the victim's
//!    data ("kernel must … keep the victim alive"); (c) reports success
//!    to QEMU via `isa-debug-exit`.
//!
//! Any other outcome (no fault, wrong fault, corrupted victim byte) is a
//! closed failure (fail closed).
