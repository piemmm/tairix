//! `plans/STRESSTEST.md` ST4 QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, log in as the seeded `root` account,
//! start **`sysmon`** on the console, drive a refresh, watch the rendered
//! kernel-statistics figures on the transcript, and quit back to an intact
//! shell prompt.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The production boot path unlocks and mounts the encrypted `ARXFS`
//! root, login authenticates `root`/`root`, and the session shell runs the
//! runner's ordered script:
//!
//! 1. `sysmon` — the store bundle spawns through the full signature +
//!    capability + interface-hash load gate; the monitor pins itself (`mem_pin`
//!    under the granted `CAP_MEM_PIN`), enters the alternate screen, and paints
//!    its first frame. The `Pres` gauge label on the transcript witnesses the
//!    gated `MEMORY_PRESSURE` figures rendered; the runner then types `r` (an
//!    immediate refresh — the `plans/STRESSTEST.md` §6 keys work over the raw
//!    console) and waits for `hit%` (the cache-hit-ratio column header of the
//!    default `RECLAIM_STATS` ledger panel).
//! 2. `q` — the monitor quits, leaves the alternate screen (restoring the
//!    covered shell content), and the shell prompt reappearing at all is
//!    the intact-screen witness: a monitor that died, hung, or wedged the
//!    console line discipline would never show it.
//! 3. `exit` — typed only after the prompt reappeared.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on `sysmon`'s exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! The kernel-side witness is `sysmon`'s audited `exit` (`SyscallInvoked`,
//! `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=sysmon`) — which only lands after the
//! whole interactive session ran. Exiting QEMU there would tear the run
//! down before the runner observed the restored prompt and sent its final
//! line, so the sink only *arms* on it and reports PASS on the **next**
//! audited `exit` — the shell's, typed only after the prompt reappeared —
//! so the verified frames provably reached the transcript before the run
//! ended (the session-ceiling arm-then-exit discipline). The runner
//! additionally fails the run if the guest exits before every scripted
//! marker appeared and every line was sent. A refused spawn, a denied
//! query rendered as a refusal the markers do not match, or a hung loop
//! never reaches the armed exit: the run times out with the failing step
//! in the serial transcript — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`),
//! so the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build
//! time (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which
//! discovers the board from it exactly as it would from real firmware.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces
//! the audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate
//! bin (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production
//! build (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does
//! next).
