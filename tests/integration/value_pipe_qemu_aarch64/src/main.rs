//! `plans/ALIAS.md` §6.2 acceptance QEMU integration test: boot the
//! production aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the
//! planted encrypted-root image, log in as the seeded `root` account, and
//! prove the shell's **value pipe** reads a value-backed resource reference
//! end to end — while the *write* direction stays refused by the kernel.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! Three claims need a live machine, and they are why this vertical exists:
//! that a child holding no `CAP_SYSINFO_*` still reads a gated fact through
//! the shell's pipe, that a tool holding one reads the same fact as its own
//! operand, and that both manifests actually arm under `manifest ∩ ceiling`.
//! A unit test injects a transport and so spans none of them.
//!
//! The runner's ordered serial script (`tools/xtask`) types each line only
//! after its marker appeared:
//!
//! 1. `cat < info:system/machine-id` — an ungated value. The kernel reports
//!    the unprovisioned sentinel, so the value is sixteen zero bytes in
//!    lowercase hex: a deterministic marker.
//! 2. `cat < info:mem/page-size` — gated on `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`. `4096` on
//!    the `virt` board, so its arrival proves the intersection armed the
//!    capability and `sysinfod` served the read.
//! 3. `cat < info:mem/physical && echo …` — the reference from the original
//!    defect report. Its value is machine-dependent, so the assertion is on
//!    `cat`'s exit status: `&&` runs the `echo` only if the read succeeded.
//! 4. `cat info:mem/physical && echo …` — the same reference as a bare
//!    **operand**, which `cat` resolves itself under its own manifest rather
//!    than reading a pipe the shell filled. The two readers are separate code
//!    paths, so both are exercised.
//! 5. `ls > info:mem/physical` — the write direction, still refused by the
//!    kernel resolver with `NotSupported`.
//! 6. `exit` — typed after the refusal message appeared.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on "refusal, then exit"
//!
//! The audit sink arms on the dispatcher's `SYSCALL_HANDLER_REJECTED` record
//! carrying `sc=resource_open` and `err=NotSupported` — the same record the
//! original defect report showed — and passes on the **next** audited `exit`.
//! Exiting on the rejection itself would tear QEMU down inside the syscall,
//! before the shell printed the refusal and before the runner sent its last
//! line. The earlier `cat`/`ls` exits cannot false-trigger: the flag is not
//! armed until the rejection is seen, and only step 5 can produce one — the
//! value reads call the broker, never `resource_open`.
//!
//! The positive steps are asserted by the runner's own "every marker appeared
//! and every line was sent" rule, which is what makes a silently empty value
//! read fail rather than pass.
//!
//! The **denial** path — an account whose ceiling lacks the capability — is
//! covered by unit tests in `tairix_procinfo::valueread`, because this image
//! seeds one account and it holds the administrator ceiling.
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer, so the
//! canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build time
//! (`build.rs`). The test reuses the entire production boot pipeline and only
//! replaces the audit sink; keeping the QEMU-exit shortcut in a dedicated bin
//! rather than a feature on a production crate stops feature unification
//! leaking it into a production build.
