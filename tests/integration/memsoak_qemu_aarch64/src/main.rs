//! `plans/APPS.md` "Immediate work" I2/I3 QEMU integration test: boot the
//! *production* aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with
//! the planted whole-disk encrypted-root image, log in as the seeded `root`
//! account, and prove — with a **numeric** `KernelMemoryStats` comparison on
//! the live system — that the per-cycle process footprint is exactly
//! reclaimed (the I2 teardown) and that the `top -d0` refresh shape retains
//! no kernel memory (the I3 live re-test).
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the shared encrypted-root fixture whose read-only
//! `/System` volume carries the standard signed store bundles **plus** the
//! test-only `memsoak` fixture bundle
//! (`tests/integration/memsoak_program`), composed and signed by the same
//! `tools/xtask` composer as every store bundle and planted only on this
//! vertical's disk — no production image ever ships it. The runner unlocks
//! the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates `root`/`root` at the
//! console login, and types the bare command word `memsoak` at the shell:
//! the store-then-`PATH` resolution finds `/System/Commands/memsoak.app/Run`,
//! the disk-backed spawn path verifies the signed bundle, and the fixture
//! runs with `manifest ∩ administrator-ceiling` authority (its manifest
//! requests `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` for the memory query; sysinfod enforces it
//! against the kernel-attested origin).
//!
//! The fixture (`tairix-test-memsoak`) then soaks the live system: warmup
//! cycles pay every once-per-boot cost, a baseline `KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS`
//! sample — free memory plus user residency, so another process allocating
//! meanwhile cannot move it (`tairix_test_memsoak::sample_bytes`) — is taken
//! through sysinfod, and each
//! of the measured cycles spawns and reaps a `true.app` child (the full
//! spawn → exit → reap → teardown path: user frames, startup block, and
//! page-table hierarchy reclaimed), parks on a timed `stream_read` whose
//! bound elapses (the `top -d0` refresh park), walks the self-scoped
//! process list, and rides a live sysinfod IPC round trip. The final sample
//! must equal the baseline **exactly**; the strict verdict is the
//! host-tested `tairix_test_memsoak::verdict`.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the fixture's exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! On a stable soak the fixture prints its `MEMSOAK PASS baseline=… final=…`
//! line and exits `0`; on **any** failure it prints the reason and parks
//! forever — it never exits — so the fixture's audited `exit`
//! (`SyscallInvoked`, `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=memsoak`) is itself
//! the kernel-side witness of a stable verdict. Exiting QEMU on that record
//! would tear the run down before the runner observed the marker and sent
//! its final line, so the sink only *arms* there and reports PASS on the
//! **next** audited `exit` — the shell's, which the runner types only after
//! the `MEMSOAK PASS` marker appeared past the fixture's own output. The
//! runner additionally fails the run if the guest exits before every
//! scripted marker appeared and every line was sent. A drifted soak, a
//! refused query, a failed spawn/wait cycle, or a fixture crash therefore
//! never reaches the armed exit: the run times out with the diagnosis (the
//! `MEMSOAK FAIL baseline=… final=…` line or the failing step's reason) in
//! the serial transcript — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`),
//! so the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build
//! time (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which
//! discovers the board from it exactly as it would from real firmware.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces
//! the audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate
//! bin (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production
//! build (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does
//! next).
