//! WIRING Stage W6 QEMU integration test: cross-CPU TLB shootdown on
//! x86_64.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! x86_64 has no broadcast TLB-invalidation instruction, so `X86_64Arch`'s
//! `tairix_arch_api::CrossCpuTlbShootdown` impl raises an inter-processor
//! interrupt at every other online CPU, each of which runs `invlpg` and
//! acknowledges; the initiator spins until every target has acknowledged.
//! This is the only port whose cross-CPU invalidation is entirely
//! hand-written software, so it gets a real-cores proof of all three ways an
//! acknowledge can come back:
//!
//! 1. The BSP enumerates the application processor from the MADT and
//!    brings it up through `smp::init_sipi_sipi` (INIT-SIPI-SIPI).
//! 2. Both CPUs install the shootdown ISR
//!    (`tlb_shootdown::init_local_tlb_shootdown`); the AP software-enables
//!    its LAPIC, unmasks interrupts, signals `AP_READY`, and waits for work.
//! 3. **From the ISR.** The BSP drives `X86_64Arch::shootdown_page` with the
//!    AP interrupt-enabled. The call returns only once the AP's ISR has run
//!    `invlpg` and decremented the count. The targeted user form
//!    (`shootdown_user_range`) then reaches the AP through a mask naming it,
//!    once past the single-page ceiling so the ISR reloads `CR3`, and raises
//!    no IPI for a mask naming only the BSP.
//! 4. **From a masked lock-acquire spin.** The BSP takes an
//!    `IrqSafeSpinLock` — which masks the BSP — and shoots down while the AP
//!    is spinning to acquire *that same lock*, so the AP has its own
//!    interrupts masked and cannot take the IPI at all. This is the
//!    production shape: the kernel-heap teardown is a masked initiator and
//!    the heap lock is the lock a second CPU spins for. The acknowledge can
//!    only come from the AP's spin round, through the spin service the port
//!    installs into `lib/sync`.
//! 5. **From a masked mailbox-acquire spin.** Both CPUs mask, rendezvous,
//!    and then each initiates a shootdown at the other. Whichever wins the
//!    descriptor cannot finish until the loser acknowledges, and the loser is
//!    masked with nothing to spin on but the descriptor — so the loser's
//!    mailbox spin is forced to be the acknowledging path, whichever way the
//!    race falls.
//!
//! A regression in any of the three leaves an initiator spinning for an
//! acknowledge that never comes, so the run times out — the documented
//! fail-loud behaviour. Steps 4 and 5 are the `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D52
//! deadlock: before the protocol let a target acknowledge from a spin, each
//! of them wedged both CPUs permanently.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links only the `tairix-arch-x86_64` port and `lib/sync`, is alloc-free,
//! and supplies its own `kernel_main` — so it installs the spin service
//! itself where the production kernel installs it in `x86_64/boot.rs`. The
//! QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin, never behind a Cargo
//! feature on the arch crate (fail closed).
