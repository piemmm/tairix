//! SPAWN stage `SP5b-2` QEMU integration test: prove an EL0 process can obtain
//! and release anonymous `RW` memory at runtime via `abi-v1` on the aarch64
//! `virt` board (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP5).
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the embedded
//! `virt` device tree (`plans/PI.md` P3/P4), brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2,
//! and installs a syscall-dispatch callback and a fault handler. It builds one
//! hardware-isolated EL0 address space — its own stage-1 page-table hierarchy —
//! from the `rxe` fixture program through the production capability-checked,
//! audited `tairix_kernel_core::spawn_image` caller, **retains it live**, and
//! installs a `tairix_kernel_core::MemMap` producer backed by
//! `tairix_kernel_mem::map_anonymous` / `unmap_anonymous` over that space and
//! its frame pool. It admits the program as a resumable user kthread
//! (`spawn_user_kthread`, `plans/SPAWN.md` SP2) and drains the cooperative
//! `step` loop; the dispatch callback routes the program's `mem_map` /
//! `mem_unmap` `svc`s through the producer.
//!
//! The program maps an anonymous region (FIXED), writes and reads back a
//! pattern, unmaps it, then touches the released range — which must raise a
//! data abort the fault handler reports as PASS. Any shortfall (the program
//! returning a failure exit code, an unexpected syscall, or no fault) trips a
//! distinct failure finisher or times out, so the run fails loudly — by a
//! failure code or by the harness `Outcome::Timeout`.
