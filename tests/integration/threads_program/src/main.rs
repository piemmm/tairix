//! THREADS stage `T3b-u` fixture: a separately-linked pure-Rust user-mode
//! program built once and driven in eleven argv-selected roles.
//!
//! The consuming verticals (`tests/integration/threads_qemu_{aarch64,riscv64,
//! x86_64}`) register this one `rxe` under role-selecting argument vectors
//! (`tairix_rt::arg(1)`):
//!
//! * **`parent`** — spawns each child role below through the production `spawn`
//!   syscall, reaps it through the production blocking `wait`, and asserts the
//!   status it must carry. Exits `0` only when every child behaved.
//! * **`counter <threads> <increments>`** — spawns `threads` threads over its
//!   *one* address space, each incrementing a shared counter `increments` times
//!   under a futex `Mutex`, then joins each for its own
//!   tally. Proves the threads genuinely share one heap, that the lock is
//!   correct under contention, and that `join` observes a value — which only
//!   works because the kernel zeroes and futex-wakes the clear-on-exit word.
//! * **`rendezvous`** — waits on a `Condvar` for a
//!   worker's flag. On the verticals' single-CPU cooperative drive a *spinning*
//!   wait would starve the worker that has to set it, so completing at all
//!   proves the wait genuinely parked and the notification genuinely woke it.
//! * **`tls <threads>`** — gives each thread its own thread-local block through
//!   the thread pointer and has it read its own magic *through* the psABI
//!   register, once before and once after a syscall. Proves the register is
//!   per-thread and survives a trap and a context switch.
//! * **`exitearly`** — a thread that ends itself with `thread_exit` instead of
//!   returning a value: the joiner must be released by the kernel's clear-on-exit
//!   wake and report `Died`, never wait forever.
//! * **`parallel <workers> <rounds>`** — builds a real `lib/parallel` worker
//!   pool and runs a divided pass through it `rounds` times, comparing every
//!   round against the same pass run on one thread. Proves the fork-join
//!   protocol itself: the epoch wake, the claim, the barrier over workers, the
//!   erased dispatch pointer's lifetime, nested dispatch, and the join at drop.
//! * **`reapchild`** — spawns a child and reaps it from a thread that is
//!   **not** the process's leader. A process id is its leader's task id, so a
//!   single-threaded reaper cannot tell a park keyed by the process from one
//!   keyed by the calling thread; a sibling can, and used to be left asleep
//!   for the rest of the boot.
//! * **`groupexit <code>`** — parks a sibling thread on a condition variable
//!   nobody will ever notify, then `exit(code)`. The process can only be reaped
//!   if the group exit drove that parked sibling to its stopping point; a fan-out
//!   that missed it leaves the process unreapable and the vertical times out.
//! * **`sanchor`**, **`smember`**, **`shold`** — a session
//!   (`docs/src/architecture/sessions.md`). The parent starts `sanchor` in a
//!   session of its own with fd 1 on a pipe; it starts `smember` in that session
//!   and `shold` in a session nested in it, and `smember` starts a `shold` in the
//!   session anchored at itself. Each reports once on the pipe and parks for
//!   ever, so every one holds a write end. The parent kills the anchor: the
//!   pipe reaches end-of-stream only once the kernel has ended all four, and a
//!   `shold` the parent started outside the session, on a pipe of its own,
//!   must still be running.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: it links the Rust userland runtime
//! `tairix-rt` (`_start`, stack canary, panic handler, syscall wrappers, the
//! thread runtime), never the C ABI. Built position-independent and converted to
//! an `rxe` blob by the consuming test's build script. On the host it is an inert
//! stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and fmt still cover the crate.
