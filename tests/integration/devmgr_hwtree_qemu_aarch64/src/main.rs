//! Design D P-3 QEMU integration test (`plans/PI.md`): boot the
//! production aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4) `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt`
//! board, have PID 1 (`init`) launch the **perpetual device-manager service**
//! (`/System/Services/devmgr.app/Run`), and prove the service's
//! reactive observe loop end to end: it reads the discovered hardware tree
//! (`hw_tree_read`), **truly parks** off the run queue in `hw_tree_wait`
//! (no busy poll), and, on a **real generation
//! bump**, wakes, re-reads, and re-parks — with no starvation of a
//! single-CPU system.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts — and how it differs from its siblings
//!
//! * `spawn_session_qemu_aarch64` proves PID 1 launches *and supervises* the
//!   login session (and, now, that it launches `devmgr` first). It does not
//!   exercise `devmgr`'s reactive wake.
//! * This vertical adds the `devmgr` end-to-end reactive proof: park →
//!   generation bump → wake → re-read → re-park.
//!
//! It reuses `boot_aarch64::boot` **verbatim** — the same production pipeline,
//! `InitSpawn` seam, runtime `ProcessSpawn` producer + embedded-program
//! registry (which carries `devmgr` in `spawn_layout::SPAWN_PROGRAMS`), and
//! `HwTreeStore` — and only swaps the injected hardware-tree *source* for the
//! observing `WitnessSource` below (the same dependency-injection seam the
//! boot path already exposes for the log/audit sinks). After
//! `kernel_core::kernel_main` emits `BootCompleted`, PID 1 `init` launches
//! `devmgr` first and then a login session per console; `devmgr` reads the
//! seeded hardware tree (logging it to fd 2) and blocks in
//! `hw_tree_wait(generation, u64::MAX)`, which **registers it on the kernel's
//! `HW_TREE_WAITQ` and parks it** (Design D P-2).
//!
//! ## How the reactive cycle is driven and witnessed — deterministically
//!
//! The witness is driven by `devmgr`'s **own** syscall activity, never by
//! incidental audit traffic: the `hw_tree_wait` handler calls
//! `HwTreeSource::generation` on every loop iteration — in the caller's
//! (`devmgr`'s) context, *after* it has registered on `HW_TREE_WAITQ` and
//! immediately before it commits to park. `devmgr` is the one and only
//! `hw_tree_wait` caller, so at that call a non-empty wait-queue is the
//! unambiguous "devmgr has registered and is about to park" witness. The
//! injected `WitnessSource` forwards every read to the authoritative
//! `HW_TREE_SOURCE` and drives a two-phase machine off that hook:
//!
//! 1. **Armed → Bumped:** the first `generation()` call at which
//!    `HW_TREE_WAITQ` is non-empty proves `devmgr` is about to park. The
//!    source publishes a node into the authoritative `HW_TREE` store — a **real**
//!    mutation that bumps the generation and calls `hw_tree_wake`, exactly a
//!    hardware hotplug. `hw_tree_wait` then observes the changed generation
//!    and returns, so `devmgr` never sleeps through the bump; it re-reads the
//!    tree and calls `hw_tree_wait` afresh.
//! 2. **Bumped → PASS:** the next `generation()` call with `HW_TREE_WAITQ`
//!    non-empty is `devmgr` re-registering for its post-bump wait: it woke on
//!    the generation change, re-read the tree (logging the new generation to
//!    fd 2), and re-parked. The full reactive cycle is proven and the source
//!    reports PASS through the ARM semihosting finisher.
//!
//! Because the trigger is `devmgr`'s own read/wait loop, the proof completes
//! whether or not any other task is producing audit events — there is no
//! dependence on a login dialogue "keeping events flowing", the race that made
//! an earlier audit-sink-driven version of this test flaky. A regression where
//! `devmgr` never spawns, never reads, never parks, or never wakes on the bump
//! never reaches the second phase, so the run times out and the harness
//! reports `Outcome::Timeout` — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## Why acting from `generation()` is a safe context
//!
//! `generation()` runs inside the `hw_tree_wait` handler **before**
//! `reschedule_current(Park)`, so no run-queue lock is held — publishing into the
//! store (which takes the store lock, then `hw_tree_wake` → `wake_all` takes
//! the wait-queue lock, both released before any `unpark`) is the same safe
//! task-context hand-off an IPC `send` wakes a receiver from, never re-entrant
//! on a held scheduler lock. Unparking `devmgr` while it is still running the
//! syscall only records the scheduler's wake-pending token, which the Park
//! commit consumes — the same lost-wake interlock the wait path already relies
//! on.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`), so
//! the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build time
//! (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which discovers
//! the console / GIC / `/memory` / timer / PSCI from it exactly as it would
//! from real firmware.
