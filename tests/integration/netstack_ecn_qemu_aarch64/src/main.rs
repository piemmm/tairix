//! `plans/NETWORK.md` N13 QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the
//! harness-side ECN-verifying passive TCP echo peer on its `dgram` netdev,
//! then prove RFC 3168 Explicit Congestion Notification end to end over the
//! live two-process network — client process, network stack, and virtio-net
//! driver each in its own address space.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the stream vertical's encrypted-root fixture — the
//! standard signed store bundles **plus** the signed virtio-net driver bundle
//! (so `devmgr` autoloads it into its own process and `netstack` binds it)
//! **plus** the test-only `tcpecho` fixture bundle
//! (`tests/integration/tcpecho_program`) — with one addition: a planted
//! `/System/Settings/Configuration/system.conf`
//! (`tairix_test_netstack_wire::ECN_SYSTEM_CONF`) that turns `net.tcp.ecn`
//! on stack-wide. `devmgr` reads that store pre-unlock over the read-only
//! `/System` endpoint and delivers `tcp_ecn = true` to `netstack`, so the
//! guest `tcpecho` client's connection negotiates ECN. Everything is composed
//! and signed by the same `tools/xtask` composer as every store bundle and
//! planted only on this vertical's disk — no production image ships the
//! fixtures.
//!
//! The runner unlocks the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates
//! `root`/`root` at the console login, and types the bare command word
//! `tcpecho` at the shell: the store-then-`PATH` resolution finds
//! `/System/Commands/tcpecho.app/Run`, the disk-backed spawn path verifies the
//! signed bundle, and the client runs with `manifest ∩ administrator-ceiling`
//! authority. The client opens a stream socket, connects to the peer's echo
//! server over the shared IPv6 link-local wire, streams a fixed deterministic
//! byte run, and verifies the peer echoes every byte back in order — exactly
//! the stream vertical's transfer. What makes this the *ECN* vertical is the
//! host peer's extra, on-wire verdict: because the guest negotiated ECN, the
//! peer (also ECN-capable) checks that the guest's SYN offered ECN (ECE+CWR),
//! that the guest's data segments carried ECT(0) in the IP header, and that —
//! after the peer echoed ECE for an injected congestion mark — the guest
//! reduced its window and set CWR on a subsequent segment. The peer's verdict
//! requires all three **and** the full echoed transfer, so a stack that
//! silently ignored the toggle (never negotiating, marking, or responding)
//! fails the run loud even though the bytes still flow.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the client's exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! On a fully verified transfer the client prints its `TCPECHO PASS …` line
//! and exits `0`; on **any** shortfall it prints the reason and parks forever
//! — it never exits — so the client's audited `exit` (`SyscallInvoked`,
//! `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=tcpecho`) is itself the kernel-side
//! witness of a verified transfer. Exiting QEMU on that record would tear the
//! run down before the runner observed the marker and sent its final line, so
//! the sink only *arms* there and reports PASS on the **next** audited `exit`
//! — the shell's, which the runner types only after the `TCPECHO PASS` marker
//! appeared past the client's own output. The runner additionally fails the
//! run if the guest exits before every scripted marker appeared, and the
//! harness requires the ECN echo peer to report its full verdict (transfer
//! echoed **and** the three ECN observations witnessed), so neither side can
//! pass alone. A refused connect, a mismatched echo, a client crash, or an
//! ECN failure therefore never reaches a passing run: it times out with the
//! diagnosis in the serial transcript / peer verdict — the documented
//! fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
