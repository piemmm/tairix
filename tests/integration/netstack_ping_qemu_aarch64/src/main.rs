//! `plans/NETWORK.md` N8b-2b-β QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the
//! harness-side passive ICMP echo responder on its `dgram` netdev, then prove
//! the **ICMP-echo** (`ping`) path end to end over the live two-process
//! network — the `ping` command process, the network stack, and the
//! virtio-net driver each in its own address space.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the shared encrypted-root fixture whose read-only
//! `/System` volume carries the **standard** signed store bundles — including
//! the real `ping` command bundle, discovered from `userland/apps/ping` by the
//! same `tools/xtask` composer as every other bundle — **plus** the signed
//! virtio-net driver bundle (so `devmgr` autoloads it into its own process and
//! `netstack` binds it). Unlike the stream/listener verticals it plants no
//! test-only fixture: `ping` is a shipping tool, exercised exactly as a user
//! would run it.
//!
//! The runner unlocks the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates
//! `root`/`root` at the console login, and types `ping -c 3 fe80::2` at the
//! shell — the host peer's link-local address, formed from the shared wire
//! identifier. The store-then-`PATH` resolution finds
//! `/System/Commands/ping.app/Run`, the disk-backed spawn path verifies the
//! signed bundle, and the tool runs with `manifest ∩ administrator-ceiling`
//! authority (its manifest
//! requests `CAP_NET` + `CAP_NET_RAW`, enforced by the netstack socket
//! dispatcher against the kernel-attested origin). `ping` opens an ICMP-echo
//! socket, resolves the peer over Neighbour Discovery, and sends three
//! `ICMPv6` echo requests over the shared IPv6 link-local wire — retrying
//! through the boot window while the NIC driver is still autoloading. The
//! peer answers each, so `ping` prints a `… icmp_seq=… time=… ms` reply line
//! per received reply.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the tool's exit *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! `ping -c 3` exits once it has sent (and waited for) its three requests,
//! whether or not any reply arrived, so its exit alone does not prove a
//! working path. Two independent witnesses close that gap:
//!
//! * The runner types the shell `exit` only after an `icmp_seq=` marker has
//!   appeared on serial — a token `ping` prints **only** on a genuinely
//!   received reply — so an unanswered run never reaches the exit and times
//!   out fail-loud with the transcript.
//! * The harness requires the host responder to report at least one *served*
//!   echo request, so a guest that never reached the peer fails the run.
//!
//! Neither side can pass alone. The guest audit sink arms on the tool's own
//! audited `exit` (`SyscallInvoked`, `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=ping`)
//! and reports PASS on the **next** audited `exit` — the shell's, typed only
//! after the `icmp_seq=` marker appeared past the tool's own output — so the
//! received reply provably reached the transcript before the run ended.
//! Exiting QEMU on the tool's own exit would tear the run down before the
//! runner observed the marker and sent its final line.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
