//! `plans/FIX-STALLTRACE.md` QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline with the debug image's diagnostics on,
//! provoke one frame-budget overrun from a planted fixture, and prove the
//! kernel's report names the blocking call and carries a live user backtrace.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The vertical's disk is the shared encrypted-root fixture whose read-only
//! `/System` volume carries the standard signed store bundles **plus** the
//! test-only `stalltrace` fixture bundle
//! (`tests/integration/stalltrace_program`), composed and signed by the same
//! `tools/xtask` composer as every store bundle and planted only on this
//! vertical's disk — no production image ever ships it. The runner unlocks
//! the root at the passphrase prompt, authenticates `root`/`root` at the
//! console login, and types the bare command word `stalltrace` at the shell.
//!
//! The fixture declares the default frame budget, opens a span through a real
//! event wait on a pipe it feeds itself, and then parks well past the budget
//! inside one syscall. The kernel must notice at that syscall's *exit* and
//! emit exactly the record [`assess`] accepts:
//!
//! - it is a `TaskLatencyOverrun` (`4150`),
//! - `blocked_in` names the syscall that spent the budget rather than
//!   leaving it to be guessed,
//! - `blocked_in_ms` is at least the budget, so the report is about the
//!   stall the fixture caused and not an incidental one,
//! - `sampled=blocking`, so the frame is the blocking call's own and not a
//!   stale one, and
//! - `pc` and `bt` are present and load-relative (the `+0x` marker), which
//!   is what proves the port published a usable frame *and* that the
//!   `copy_in`-backed walk read a real chain off the stalling user stack.
//!
//! That last point is the whole reason this vertical exists: the state
//! machine is host-tested, but nothing on the host can prove the aarch64
//! trampoline hands over the right registers or that the walk crosses the
//! kernel/user boundary safely.
//!
//! ## Why the gate listens on the diagnostic trail, not the audit trail
//!
//! The overrun report is an address-bearing developer aid, so it is emitted
//! through the diagnostic (log/UART) stream and deliberately never reaches
//! the hash-chained audit trail — the same split the lockup detail uses. So
//! this vertical installs its gate there and hands the audit trail straight
//! to serial, the reverse of the usual wiring. Everything the gate sees is
//! replayed to serial first, so the transcript still carries the whole
//! boot → unlock → login → stall timeline and the host can gate its
//! injection on it.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS keys on the record *then* the shell's exit
//!
//! Exiting QEMU the instant the record arrives — or on the fixture's own
//! `exit` — would tear the run down with the last scripted line still owed,
//! which the harness fails as an incomplete script. Two things must
//! therefore have happened before the PASS fires: an accepted record on the
//! diagnostic trail, and the fixture's own audited `exit` on the audit
//! trail. It then reports PASS on the *next* audited `exit` — the shell's,
//! which the runner types only after `STALLTRACE PROVOKED` appeared. A
//! missing record, a malformed one, or a fixture that failed its own setup
//! never reaches that point: the run times out with the diagnosis in the
//! serial transcript — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! A refused record is not merely ignored, either: the gate fails the run at
//! once through the shared finisher, so a report that arrives *wrong* is a
//! distinct, immediate failure rather than an indistinguishable timeout.
//!
//! ## Embedded `virt` device tree
//!
//! QEMU's `-kernel <ELF>` aarch64 path passes no DTB pointer (`x0 = 0`), so
//! the canonical `virt` device tree is dumped and embedded at build time
//! (`build.rs`) and its address handed to the boot pipeline, which discovers
//! the board from it exactly as it would from real firmware.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and replaces only
//! the diagnostic sink; it additionally enables `watchdog-diagnostics`,
//! because the facility under test exists in no other configuration — that
//! is the same feature `tools/xtask` turns on for the non-shippable `debug`
//! image. Splitting the observer behaviour into a separate bin (instead of a
//! Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature unification from
//! leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build.
