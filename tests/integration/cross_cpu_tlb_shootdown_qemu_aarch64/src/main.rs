//! WIRING Stage W6 QEMU integration test: cross-CPU TLB shootdown on the
//! aarch64 `virt` board.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! The `tairix_arch_api::CrossCpuTlbShootdown` HAL slice requires that a
//! page-table edit on one CPU can be made visible on the others. On
//! aarch64 this needs no IPI: `Aarch64Arch::shootdown_page` issues the
//! *inner-shareable broadcast* `tlbi vaae1is` + `dsb ish`/`isb`, which the
//! hardware propagates to every PE in the inner-shareable domain. This
//! binary proves that path on a real two-core `virt` board:
//!
//! 1. The boot core starts core 1 via `smp::start_secondary` (the PSCI
//!    `CPU_ON` call); core 1 signals `READY` and idles, so the domain
//!    genuinely contains a second PE.
//! 2. The boot core drives `Aarch64Arch::shootdown_page` — the broadcast
//!    invalidation + barriers — and reaches the PASS finisher, proving the
//!    broadcast executes on a real multi-core machine without faulting.
//!
//! Unlike the `riscv64`/`x86_64` verticals there is no software acknowledge to
//! observe: the broadcast and its `dsb ish` completion are the hardware's
//! responsibility, exactly as the local `flush_page` (the same instruction)
//! is already exercised by `memory_isolation_qemu_aarch64`.
//!
//! A regression that fails to start the core or that faults in
//! `shootdown_page` never reaches the PASS write, so the run times out or
//! trips a failure finisher — the documented fail-loud behaviour.
//!
//! ## PSCI conduit
//!
//! As in `ipi_smp_qemu_aarch64`, the QEMU `virt` board's conduit is `hvc`
//! and QEMU's ELF `-kernel` boot hands no DTB pointer, so the test names
//! the board's known conduit directly; the runtime FDT-discovery path is
//! proven by W1's tests, not re-proved here.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links only the `tairix-arch-aarch64` port and supplies its own
//! `kernel_main`. The QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin,
//! never behind a Cargo feature on the arch crate (fail closed).
