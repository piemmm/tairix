//! `plans/NETWORK.md` N16b QEMU integration test: boot the *production*
//! aarch64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline on the `virt` board with the planted
//! whole-disk encrypted-root image, a virtio-net device attached, and the
//! harness-side **SYN-flood** client peer on its `dgram` netdev, then prove
//! the listener's RFC 4987 stateless-SYN-cookie defence end to end over the
//! live two-process network — server process, network stack, and virtio-net
//! driver each in its own address space.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! It reuses the N6b-2-β-2 listener vertical's disk and guest fixture
//! unchanged (`FsDisk::ListenRootDisk`, the `tcpserve` server): the thing
//! under test is the *stack's* behaviour under connection exhaustion, not a
//! new guest program. What differs is the peer
//! (`NetPeerMode::V6TcpFlood`), which:
//!
//! 1. fills the listener's bounded half-open backlog with SYNs from distinct
//!    source ports that it **never answers**, so every slot is occupied by a
//!    handshake that will never complete — exactly a SYN flood; then
//! 2. opens one *real* connection. Its SYN meets a full backlog, so the
//!    listener can admit it only by falling back to a stateless cookie:
//!    the server ISN is a keyed MAC over the 4-tuple, and the connection is
//!    reconstructed from the client's returning ACK with no per-connection
//!    state held meanwhile; then
//! 3. streams the whole deterministic transfer over that cookie-admitted
//!    connection and verifies the guest echoes every byte back in order.
//!
//! A stack whose backlog grew without bound, or which refused the connection
//! once the backlog filled, cannot complete step 3.
//!
//! ## Why the PASS needs all three witnesses
//!
//! * **The cookie brake must be observed engaging.** `netstack` audits it
//!   once per listener on the transition (`SYN_COOKIES_ENGAGED`), and the
//!   serial script requires that message before it will await the fixture's
//!   PASS marker. This is the witness that distinguishes a cookie-admitted
//!   connection from an ordinary one: without it a run where the flood never
//!   landed would look identical to a pass.
//! * **The exchange must be verified guest-side.** On a fully verified
//!   exchange `tcpserve` prints `TCPSERVE PASS …` and exits `0`; on any
//!   shortfall it prints the reason and parks forever, so its audited `exit`
//!   (`SyscallInvoked`, `EventId(5000)`, `sc=exit`, `comm=tcpserve`) is
//!   itself the kernel-side witness of a verified exchange. The sink only
//!   *arms* there and reports PASS on the **next** audited `exit` — the
//!   shell's, which the runner types only after the marker appeared — so the
//!   report provably reached the transcript before the run ended.
//! * **The peer must agree.** Its verdict is `Ok` only if it both sent the
//!   whole flood *and* got the whole transfer echoed back verified, so a run
//!   that never filled the backlog fails even if the guest served an
//!   ordinary connection perfectly.
//!
//! No side passes alone, and the run times out fail-loud with the reason in
//! the serial transcript.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production aarch64 boot pipeline and only replaces the
//! audit sink. Splitting the audit-observer behaviour into a separate bin
//! (instead of a Cargo feature on a production crate) prevents feature
//! unification from leaking the QEMU-exit shortcut into any production build
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what the kernel does next).
