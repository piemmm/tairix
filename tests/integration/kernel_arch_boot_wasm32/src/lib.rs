//! Browser-headless integration test for the wasm32 Arch HAL.
//!
//! Built for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` this `cdylib` is the wasm32
//! analogue of the bare-metal `kernel_arch_boot_*` / `sched_drive_qemu_*`
//! QEMU verticals. It exercises the wasm32 deliverables (`PLAN.md` Stage 3
//! + `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W8) in a real browser:
//!
//! * **Boots to `init`.** `kernel_main` brings the `WasmArch` handle up
//!   on the main thread (logical CPU 0) and prints `BOOT_OK`.
//! * **Per-worker memory isolation.** Every context builds an
//!   `AddressSpace` over its *own* live WASM linear memory
//!   (`isolation::live_memory_region`) and confirms an attacker confined
//!   to a disjoint region — standing in for another worker's separate
//!   linear memory — faults on this context's bytes, printing
//!   `ISOLATION_OK`.
//! * **Live `kernel/sched` scheduler driven by the frame tick.** CPU 0
//!   builds a real `tairix_kernel_sched_mlfq::Scheduler` over
//!   `WasmArch`, installs the `preempt` tick callback so each
//!   `requestAnimationFrame` frame drives `Scheduler::on_timer_tick` and
//!   dispatches a task via `step`, and prints `TICK` per frame.
//! * **Multi-worker SMP + cross-context IPI.** CPU 0 spawns a real Web
//!   Worker as logical CPU 1 (`smp::start_worker`); CPU 1 boots its own
//!   live scheduler and prints `WORKER_OK`. CPU 0 then sends CPU 1 a
//!   directed IPI (`SchedulerArch::send_ipi`); the `MessageChannel`
//!   delivery drives CPU 1's live scheduler, which prints `IPI_RECV`.
//!
//! The browser harness (`web/harness.mjs`, launched by `cargo xtask test
//! --wasm`) scrapes those console markers and reports PASS once it has
//! seen `BOOT_OK`, `ISOLATION_OK`, `WORKER_OK`, `IPI_RECV`, and at least
//! twenty `TICK`s; any panic traps the instance and fails the run loudly.
//!
//! On a host build (`itest_wasm32` off) this compiles to an inert empty
//! `cdylib`, exactly as the bare-metal verticals are inert host stubs.
