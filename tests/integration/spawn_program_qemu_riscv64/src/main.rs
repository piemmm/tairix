//! CCOMPAT stage CC3 QEMU integration test: spawn a separately-linked C-ABI
//! program (crt0 + abi-sys) on the riscv64 `virt` board and assert its `exit`
//! syscall carries the decimal argument it was spawned with.
//!
//! On boot the test builds an Sv39 address space that identity-maps the kernel
//! and MMIO, activates it, installs the trap vector and a dispatch callback,
//! then calls the production capability-checked, audited spawn caller
//! (`tairix_kernel_core::spawn_and_enter`, gated on `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`) to
//! materialise the program's U-mode image — built from the `rxe` blob the
//! build script produced — and `sret` into it. The program parses `argv[1]`
//! and returns it; crt0 routes the return through the `exit` syscall, whose
//! `ecall` traps back through the kernel S-mode vector to the dispatch
//! callback, which asserts the code equals the spawned argument before the
//! `SiFive` Test PASS finisher.
