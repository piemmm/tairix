//! USERS `U4` QEMU integration test: prove on the aarch64 `virt` board that
//! a **service account's compiled capability ceiling binds a lying
//! manifest** end to end (`plans/USERS.md` U4).
//!
//! On boot the test reads the GICv2 base + generic-timer rate from the
//! embedded `virt` device tree, brings up the EL1 vectors + GICv2, and
//! installs the **production** `KernelDispatchHook` through a
//! `DispatchCallbackSlot` — with the real compiled system identity table
//! (`tairix_kernel_core::system_identity_table`, the same table the boot
//! `sec` phase installs) resolving spawn-as-user switches, the seeded
//! hardware tree backing `hw_tree_read`, and a `ProgramRegistry` whose one
//! `svc` row deliberately requests devmgr's ceiling **plus every sibling
//! service's defining capability**. The parent role of the fixture program
//! (`tests/integration/service_ceiling_program`) is spawned through the
//! production `InitSpawnCtx::spawn_driver_process` seam holding
//! `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` + `CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER`; it switches `svc` into the
//! devmgr account through the production `spawn` syscall. Running **as
//! devmgr**, `svc` proves the `ceiling ∩ manifest` intersection at the
//! audited dispatcher gate through real traps:
//!
//! * its own `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`-gated `hw_tree_read` succeeds — the account's
//!   genuine grant survives the intersection;
//! * an identity-switching spawn is refused `PermissionDenied` — neither `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`
//!   nor login's `CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER` survives, so the identity switch fails
//!   closed;
//! * `users_db_read` is refused `PermissionDenied` — login's
//!   `CAP_USERS_READ` was stripped;
//! * `seat_switch` is refused `PermissionDenied` — seatmgr's
//!   `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` was stripped;
//! * `sysinfo_introspect` is refused `PermissionDenied` — sysinfod's
//!   `CAP_SYSINFO_INTROSPECT` was stripped.
//!
//! The chassis reaps the parent through the wait producer's non-blocking
//! poll; PASS fires only on a parent exit of 0. Any misbehaviour surfaces
//! as a distinct failure finisher (the parent's diagnostic exit code is
//! folded into the finisher), and a wedged run times out through the
//! harness (fail-loud).
