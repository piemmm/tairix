//! `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D82 QEMU integration test: a live, scheduled
//! kthread running on a **window-backed** kernel stack takes a synchronous
//! data abort the instant it overruns into the stack's guard slot.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! A kthread kernel stack is a run of pages in the shared kernel remap
//! window whose lowest slot is reserved but never mapped. Because that
//! window's sub-hierarchy is installed by every translation root, the guard
//! is absent everywhere at once — nothing refines a live block, and no root
//! carries a per-task unmap. What this vertical proves on the board is the
//! payoff: an *overrunning kthread* faults **synchronously in hardware**,
//! rather than being caught only at the next reschedule by the
//! software-canary `tairix_kernel_core::kthread::BoxStack` fallback.
//!
//! ## What this test asserts
//!
//! 1. Reserve the kernel remap window, build a stage-1 identity space (which
//!    installs the window's shared slots), and activate it.
//! 2. Install the window-backed kthread stack tier over that window and draw
//!    one stack from it — the production allocation path.
//! 3. The drawn stack's usable run is mapped and writable, and its guard
//!    slot lies one page below the usable base.
//! 4. Build the live `tairix_kernel_sched_eevdf::Scheduler` over
//!    `Aarch64Arch` and admit a kthread on that stack via
//!    `spawn_kthread_with_stack` — the production runtime path, not a bare
//!    function call.
//! 5. The kthread body overruns: it writes the highest byte of its guard
//!    slot, the first byte a contiguous downward overrun crosses. That slot
//!    is unmapped, so the access raises a synchronous data abort while the
//!    kthread is *running*, taken on the still-healthy usable stack above the
//!    guard so the EL1 trampoline does not nest-fault.
//! 6. The handler confirms the trap is a data abort on exactly the guard
//!    slot and reports PASS. A regression that left the slot mapped lets the
//!    body return cleanly; the cooperative `step` loop then drains the task
//!    and the test reports FAILURE explicitly rather than passing.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It links the `tairix-kernel-core` kthread runtime, the
//! `tairix-arch-aarch64` port, and the default `tairix-kernel-sched-eevdf`
//! policy directly and supplies its own `kernel_main`, installing the window
//! and the stack tier itself rather than booting the whole pipeline. The
//! QEMU-exit shortcut lives in this dedicated bin, never behind a Cargo
//! feature on a library crate (fail closed).
