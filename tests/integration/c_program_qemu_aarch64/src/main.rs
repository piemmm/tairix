//! CCOMPAT stage CC5 QEMU integration test: spawn a genuinely C-compiled
//! program (clang object + crt0 + abi-sys staticlib) into EL0 on the aarch64
//! `virt` board and assert it exits `99` — i.e. every abi-v1 C-header check and
//! both syscall round-trips it performs succeed.
//!
//! On boot the test enables `CPACR_EL1.FPEN`, builds a stage-1 address space
//! that identity-maps the kernel and MMIO (EL1), activates it, installs the EL1
//! vector table and a dispatch callback, then calls the production
//! capability-checked, audited spawn caller (`tairix_kernel_core::spawn_and_enter`,
//! gated on `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`) to materialise the program's EL0 image — built
//! from the `rxe` blob the build script produced — and `eret` into it. The C
//! program checks a Time64 value across the boundaries, an ipc header, and
//! a sysinfo header, then calls `cap_query` and `clock_get`; the dispatch
//! callback services those two syscalls (returning a known answer / sentinel)
//! and finally asserts the `exit` code is `99` before the ARM semihosting PASS
//! finisher.
