//! The autoload desktop vertical's **interaction contract**: the shared
//! readiness markers each stage of the scripted click-through waits on,
//! which the freestanding test kernel's PASS gate (`src/main.rs`) and the
//! host-side runner's screendump keys and step gates (`tools/xtask`
//! `qemu_tests`) both import, so the script and its observers can never
//! drift (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3 + AW4).
//!
//! **Every stage gates on a witness only its own subject can produce** — a
//! guest-emitted readiness marker, a named bundle load, or a window's own
//! frame map — never on a cumulative count of an event the whole system
//! emits, and never on traffic to a rendezvous many clients share. Both
//! rules are paid for: the FONT-SERVICE cadence change shifted the old
//! cumulative `MessageDelivered` thresholds so they fired during the
//! terminal stage and stalled the run (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D20), and
//! the desktop-info query the Switchboard issues at start-up later fired an
//! "the files window was created" gate that had been keyed on *any* reply
//! over the shared `WINDOW_ENDPOINT`, clicking empty desktop half a second
//! before that window existed. A gate that another component can satisfy is
//! the defect; a stage waits for its own subject or it does not wait at all.
//!
//! The file-manager stages (FM9/FM10/FM11) are deliberately not driven here
//! — they are host-tested in `lib/browse`; this vertical proves driver
//! autoload, unlock, display bind, and the keyboard → session → terminal →
//! pty → shell round trip.
//!
//! The desktop session's window engine is the only port sender in this
//! image, so each `MessageDelivered` is exactly one delivered
//! `WindowEvent`, and the record's `port` field names the window it went
//! to — which is what makes a per-window delivery ordinal attributable
//! where a system-wide total is not:
//!
//! 1. Clicking the files slot relays its default action to the app (the first
//!    delivery to its port), which opens a window at the user's home.
//! 2. That window's first present maps and focuses it, and the session
//!    reports the move app-ward at once: `Focus { focused: true }`.
//! 3. The scripted pointer, which waits on the session's own witness that the
//!    window's first frame is on screen, then reaches the window: the first
//!    delivery after it is shown, on which the guest emits
//!    [`FILES_WINDOW_ACTIVATED_MARKER`] — the served window demonstrably
//!    exists, holds the keyboard and is on the composited desktop, keying the
//!    second screendump.
//! 4. The next delivery to the same port is the click's own, on which the
//!    guest emits [`FILES_HANDSHAKE_MARKER`]: the wake boundary the terminal
//!    stage waits on (the runner holds its library-popup clicks behind it,
//!    and behind the pending dump).
//! 5. The terminal stage (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW4): the taskbar's Library
//!    button opens the program-library popup (a session-owned surface —
//!    no app-ward delivery), its `Terminal` entry spawns the terminal
//!    bundle through the catalog the session merged from the planted
//!    machine store (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5), and the terminal's first
//!    present moves the keyboard to it: the files window is told
//!    `Focus { focused: false }` and the terminal `Focus { focused: true }`,
//!    the gate after which the runner types the shell command.
//! 5. Once the terminal is focused, the runner types [`TERMINAL_COMMAND`]
//!    (`sleep 3600` + Enter); the terminal writes the line to the shell,
//!    which resolves and loads the store bundle
//!    [`TERMINAL_ROUND_TRIP_BUNDLE`] (`sleep.app`). That load — attributed
//!    by the bundle's own name — is the AW4 round-trip witness; on it the
//!    guest emits [`CTRL_C_ARM_MARKER`].
//! 6. The pty job-control (`Ctrl-C`) witness (`plans/PTY.md`): the
//!    [`CTRL_C_ARM_MARKER`] gates the runner's [`TERMINAL_CTRL_C_RECOVERY`]
//!    step — a `Ctrl-C` (which the terminal encodes as the `0x03` interrupt
//!    byte) whose cooked-mode line discipline signals the foreground `sleep`
//!    dead, then `true` + Enter. Because the shell is parked in `wait` on
//!    `sleep` until it dies, loading [`CTRL_C_RECOVERY_BUNDLE`] (`true.app`)
//!    is reachable **only** if `Ctrl-C` interrupted `sleep`: keyboard →
//!    session → terminal → pty cooked `^C` → foreground signal → job death →
//!    shell recovery, every hop kernel-attested — the vertical's sixth and
//!    final witness. A failed interrupt leaves `sleep` blocking past the run
//!    budget, so the witness never latches and the run times out (fail
//!    loud).
