//! QEMU integration vertical: **activate a document in the file manager's own
//! window, and watch its authority cross three principals into the viewer that
//! was already running** (`plans/VIEW.md`, `plans/APPWIN.md` AW5).
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! Every layer is host-tested: the `HandOverLaunch` and open-target wire
//! shapes and their refusals, the window engine's per-client queue and its
//! wake, the session's launch resolution and the relay's fail-closed paths,
//! the kernel's non-widening pass-through of a *held* delegation, and the
//! viewer's drain. What only a real machine can show is that they are **wired
//! to each other across three principals**: activating an item in a window the
//! *file manager* owns makes the manager mint a delegation for a file it
//! opened under the user's identity, the *session* redeem that delegation and
//! grant the same authority on — never its own larger reach — and the
//! *viewer*, which holds no filesystem capability at all, redeem what arrives.
//!
//! So the guest boots the **production** aarch64 pipeline
//! (`boot_aarch64::boot`) against a planted encrypted root, and the host drives
//! the desktop blind through the QEMU monitor: unlock, log in, start the
//! desktop, open a file-manager window from its icon-bar slot, and activate the
//! planted picture in it — once per relay, plus the first activation, which
//! finds no viewer and makes the *manager* start one. Only the audit sink is
//! swapped, for the PASS witnesses below.
//!
//! Nothing pre-launches the viewer, deliberately: the instance every later
//! document must reach is then one the **desktop never spawned**, so the only
//! thing that can name it is the identity the kernel attested. While the script
//! launched it from the program library first, the desktop's own launch table
//! knew it and this vertical could not have failed.
//!
//! # The PASS gate
//!
//! [`RELAY_ROUNDS`] complete relays. One relay is the four dispatched
//! syscalls of [`RELAY_CHAIN`], which must land **in that order**, each
//! attributed by the kernel to the principal that made it:
//!
//! 1. the manager mints (`fd_grant` from `files`),
//! 2. the session redeems it, bound to the manager (`fd_redeem_from` from
//!    `desktop`),
//! 3. the session mints the same authority on (`fd_grant` from `desktop`),
//! 4. the viewer redeems it (`fd_redeem` from `view`).
//!
//! Unrelated records between the steps are ignored rather than breaking the
//! chain — thousands of syscalls separate them — so what the gate asserts is
//! the *relative* order of the four, which is the claim: read as a set they
//! would be consistent with three processes touching descriptors of their own;
//! read as a sequence they can only be one authority travelling to a principal
//! with no authority to open the file itself.
//!
//! Each latched step prints its own marker
//! ([`RELAY_STEP_MARKERS`](tairix_test_handover_qemu_aarch64::RELAY_STEP_MARKERS)),
//! so a run that does not pass states how far the authority travelled rather
//! than only falling silent — the difference between "the gesture never
//! reached an item" and "the desktop never redeemed what it was handed".
//!
//! Every relay after the first additionally requires the viewer's redeem to
//! come from the **same kernel-attested task**. That is what makes this "one
//! viewer process, three documents" rather than "a viewer per document": a task
//! belongs to one process for its whole life, so the same task redeeming each
//! means the desktop's single-instance funnel reached the instance that was
//! already running, and the viewer opened another window rather than another
//! viewer being started. A redeem from any other task resets the chain instead
//! of completing it (fail closed) — which is exactly what a desktop resolving a
//! slot's application from its own launch bookkeeping produced, because the
//! manager, not the desktop, started the viewer.
//!
//! # Why the guest latches no frame
//!
//! Reading the screen is the host's job. The guest deliberately claims nothing
//! about pixels: what it can attest is which principal called which syscall,
//! from which thread of control, and that is the whole security claim here.
//!
//! # Why the guest cannot exit early
//!
//! Each relay is caused by one activation in the manager's window, and both of
//! that activation's gestures are gated on the session's own announcement that
//! the surface they aim at is ready for them — the window on screen (raised
//! back to the front, for every activation after the first) for the press that
//! opens the item's menu, the drawn plate for the press on its *Open* row. So
//! the records that complete the PASS cannot happen before the gestures that
//! cause them.
//!
//! A panic before the gate parks the CPU, the guest falls silent, and the
//! runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
