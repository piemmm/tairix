//! QEMU integration vertical: **open Settings from the system quick-actions
//! menu, walk its sidebar, and change the desktop's look through its
//! Appearance pane** (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md` DS13).
//!
//! # What this proves that no host test can
//!
//! Every pane is host-tested: the registry, the strip and its scroll, the
//! forms, the volume cards, the absence statements, and the apply that asks
//! the session to adopt a change. What only a running machine can show is that
//! they are wired to each other and to the desktop — that the capsule's menu
//! launches the installed bundle, that a press on a strip row reaches the
//! window and moves it to the pane drawn there, that the pane's frame reaches
//! the screen, and that choosing an appearance becomes a durable change the
//! desktop redraws itself in.
//!
//! So the guest boots the **production** aarch64 pipeline
//! (`boot_aarch64::boot`) against a planted encrypted root carrying the signed
//! input and display driver bundles and the complete app store, and the host
//! drives the desktop blind through the QEMU monitor: unlock, log in, start
//! the desktop, open the capsule's menu, choose *Settings…*, photograph the
//! window on General, walk to a pane that states an absence, scroll the strip,
//! walk to Storage, page the strip back up, walk to Appearance and choose
//! the appearance the desktop did not boot in, photograph the desktop redrawn
//! in it, and finally choose Compact density on the same pane. Only the audit sink is swapped, for the PASS
//! witnesses below.
//!
//! # The PASS gate
//!
//! Four latches, in order, each attributable to exactly one act:
//!
//! 1. **Settings launched.** An `APP_LOADED` record naming the bundle
//!    [`SETTINGS_APP_NAME`] spells — the menu row's own launch.
//! 2. **Its window opened.** A `WINDOW_CREATE_REPLY_LEN` reply on the
//!    reserved window endpoint after that load. Settings opens one window,
//!    and the desktop's own surfaces never call the window channel.
//! 3. **The pane's choice became durable.** A rename replacing the desktop's
//!    published settings document after that create: the app-data service
//!    commits a document by writing it whole and renaming it over the live
//!    one, and only an adopted change of look rewrites it in this run.
//! 4. **The next one did too.** A second such rename — the density choice.
//!    It changes a key the first did not, so it commits whether or not
//!    Settings has adopted the restyled desktop by the time it lands.
//!
//! Counting renames of that one path is attributable because the path is the
//! desktop's alone and nothing else in this world rewrites it.
//!
//! # Why the guest cannot exit early
//!
//! The last dump photographs the desktop after the pane's choice, and the
//! choice that completes the PASS is made only after the runner has read that
//! dump back: the runner sends no pointer step until every screendump it has
//! asked for is on disk and parsed.
//!
//! A panic before all four latches parks the CPU, the guest falls silent, and
//! the runner reports a timeout — loud failure, never a false pass.
