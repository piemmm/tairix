//! The Settings vertical's shared contract
//! (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md` DS13).
//!
//! The freestanding guest kernel (`src/main.rs`) and the host runner's
//! enrolment (`tools/xtask/src/commands/qemu_tests.rs`) both read these
//! definitions, so what the host injects and what the guest latches cannot
//! drift apart.
//!
//! # Who states what
//!
//! - The **host** reads the serial transcript, so it gates each gesture and
//!   each screendump on the desktop session's own announcements: the system
//!   menu drawn, the Settings window's first frame on screen, each pane's
//!   frame on screen (the window wears the pane's title, and the session
//!   announces the frame that carries a new title), and the desktop redrawn in
//!   the appearance chosen.
//! - The **guest** kernel's audit sink sees kernel audit records only, so it
//!   gates on those: the bundle a load names, the window channel's create
//!   reply, and each commit of the desktop's published settings document,
//!   attributed by the path it replaced rather than by how many writes have
//!   gone by (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D19/D20).
//!
//! Neither side infers the other's facts.
//!
//! Two spellings are borrowed — the desktop's publisher identity and the
//! app-data service's published file name — and generated from their own
//! definitions at build time: linked into the guest, the crates that define
//! them would switch on an allocator in every kernel built beside it.
