//! In-RAM filesystem soak harness (`docs/src/filesystem/soak.md`).
//!
//! Formats a RAM-backed [`RamBlock`] device with each first-party
//! formatter (`arxfs`/`ext4`/`fat32`) and drives one generic,
//! filesystem-agnostic [`exercise()`] body over the frozen
//! `FilesystemRead`/`FilesystemWrite` ABI: create/write/read-back/
//! truncate/remove round-trips across nested directories with a remount
//! re-verification, plus the fail-closed extremes — `NoSpace`
//! on a full data region, `Busy` on a duplicate create or a
//! non-empty `rmdir`, and `LengthOutOfRange` on an empty or
//! oversize name. There is no `mkfs` shell-out and no parallel
//! re-implementation of any filesystem semantics: the
//! harness consumes the OS's own formatters and read/write paths and
//! asserts the OS reports the extremes cleanly.
//!
//! The exerciser drives a small LCG from a per-launch start seed (fresh from
//! host entropy by default, or pinned by `tairix_fuzzseed::FSSOAK_SEED_ENV`).
//! The start seed is logged at the start of each run, so every launch
//! exercises different content yet any failure reproduces from its logged
//! seed.
//!
//! Alongside that fixed-sequence body, [`random_exercise`] drives a
//! genuinely *randomized*, model-checked op mix (create/move/delete/
//! extend/truncate in a different order every run) against a byte-exact
//! oracle, registered as the `arxfs-random` soak target so it runs in
//! parallel with the others (`tools/ci/soak.sh`).
