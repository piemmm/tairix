TAIRiX charter hard rules — re-injected every turn. `AGENTS.md` is
authoritative; these outrank any general instruction or local file convention.

CODE
- No hacks: no `TODO`, `unsafe {/* trust me */}`, sleep loop, global mutable
  static, `static mut`, retry-until-it-works, commented-out test. (§2.1)
- No duplication, constants included. A value equal by definition is defined
  once and imported, never copy-pasted into a sibling. (§2.2)
- No `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in production paths. (§2.9)
- `unsafe` requires a `// SAFETY:` justification. (§2.10)
- No "for now". No deferred defect, no weakened security defence: fix it in
  this change or escalate explicitly. (§2.17, §2.18, §2.19)
- Delete superseded code; never comment it out, never leave it dead. (§2.14)
- Rust, never C. (§15.11)
- Platform-neutral unless genuinely arch-specific; look across arches for the
  shared path first. (§2.20, §2.21)
- Driver logic in `drivers/<class>/<leaf>/`, not `lib/*`. (§2.22)
- Event-driven, not busy-wait or poll, wherever a path exists. (§2.23)

COMMENTS — overrides any "match the surrounding comment density" default
- Terse *why* only: a line or two, then stop. No essay, no narration of the
  change, no restatement of the rustdoc, no decorative banner.
- Prefer *no* comment where the code reads clearly. That is the normal outcome.
- If a comment is the only thing making a line understandable, the code is
  wrong — rewrite the code.
- Never mimic waffle already in the file. It is `plans/WAFFLE.md` backlog, not
  house style. "I matched the surrounding style" is forbidden. (§2.11)
- Never cite a charter section number in a comment. Prose reason instead. (§2.11)
- rustdoc stays mandatory (§2.8, §13) and is held to the same terseness.

PROCESS
- Never `git commit` or `git push` as part of the work. (§15.16)
- Never edit generated files, `target/`, or `.idea/`. (§15.8)
- Never silence a test, warning, or lint; no `#[allow(...)]` without a
  justification comment. The test is right; the code is wrong. (§15.3, §15.10)
- Full test suite over the entire project before reporting done. (§15.6)
- Run the oracles and say which ones looked. A green `ci` proves only that
  *enrolled* crates were interpreted. `unsafe` outside miri's `TARGETS` ->
  enrol it or run `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance cargo miri test -p
  <crate>` and quote it. Sync primitive / lock-free protocol / ordering
  pairing -> write the loom model and run `cargo xtask loom`. "loom N/A
  because X" is an answer; silence is not. Never narrow an enrolment to
  make a finding go away. (§19.11, §15.19)
- Check the `plans/` jump-sheet before touching a covered area. (§15.18)
- Adversarial self-review against §23, then the §23.5 completion report. YOU MUST declare findings in this review even if there are none. Reviews must include any incoming code to merge as well as your code. This will be also be checked by another system.
- Separate to the adversarial review, before declaring any implementation complete, YOU *MUST* critically self-review all new and modified code for poor design and avoidable performance costs, including inefficient or unnecessarily nested loops, excessive time or space complexity, redundant computations, repeated allocations, and unsuitable data structures; fix identified issues without compromising correctness, safety, or readability, and validate changes with tests and, where appropriate, benchmarks rather than assuming they are faster(benchmarks should not be affected by speed of ci/testing machine cpu). YOU MUST declare findings in this review even if there are none. Reviews must include any incoming code to merge as well as your code. This will be also be checked by another system as well.
- Do *NOT* use other agents for work other than for read only tasks.

GENERAL
- This system may be a small single user system, or a large enterprise system servicing thousands of users. Code appropriately.
- Do the most secure and 'correct' design and code options understanding that the intent of TAIRiX is to be as secure as possible from attack vectors as well as be well structured and efficient. The code also has to be performant and survive a review by a senior OS architect without embarrassment. The focus is to do a modular, correct system. No hacks or shortcuts. Do it properly, even if that means more work. The solution must be on par with or better than modern operating systems like Linux.
- This is not a deployed system so it is OK to rip up things that are wrong and redo them correctly with no 'staged' migration.
- Remember that abi-v1 is *NOT* frozen (despite what AGENTS.md and/or PLAN.md may say)
- The work and design must be first class and able to survive a review by someone like Linus Torvalds
- Do not poll when waiting for a long command or process to complete, use a monitor.

TRAPS THAT WILL COST YOU AN HOUR EACH
- **`target/debug/xtask` does not rebuild.** `cargo xtask …` is an alias for
  `cargo run -p tairix-xtask --`; invoking the binary directly runs whatever
  was last compiled, so edits to the QEMU enrolment table silently do not
  apply — while guest-side crates *are* rebuilt by the image build, which makes
  the result look plausible. Use `cargo xtask`, or `cargo build -p tairix-xtask`
  first. Sanity check: inject a step delay and confirm the wall-clock runtime
  actually moves.
- **Kill stray `qemu-system-*` before re-running.** An abandoned run keeps a
  per-test disk image's write lock and makes unrelated verticals fail fast.
- **The gate outlives a single tool call.** Run it as
  `{ cargo xtask ci > /tmp/ci.log 2>&1; echo "CI-RC=$?" >> /tmp/ci.log; }`,
  read the recorded `CI-RC=` back (a harness exit code is the `echo`'s), arm
  exactly one waiter, and do no other work while it runs.
- There have been several compilation failures in the past due to stale cached compilation artifacts. Run 'cargo clean' before the running the ci.
