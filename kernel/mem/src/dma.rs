//! Per-process-heap DMA allocator.
//!
//! the charter requires every kernel-side DMA facility to:
//!
//! 1. Carve allocations out of the calling process's heap, never a
//!    global pool;
//! 2. Place guard pages around the slab so a buffer over-run faults
//!    instead of silently corrupting a neighbour;
//! 3. Zero every byte on free, because any DMA buffer may have held
//!    credentials, key material, or capability tokens at some point in
//!    its lifetime;
//! 4. Report exhaustion through a [`Result`] — allocation failure is
//!    never a panic.
//!
//! This module owns the architecture-neutral half of that contract. It
//! composes the existing [`FrameAllocator`] (for contiguous-by-physical
//! frame blocks) with an [`AddressSpace<P>`] (for the per-process
//! virtual-address window). The capability check itself lives in
//! `kernel/sec::dma`, since `kernel/mem` deliberately depends on
//! neither `tairix-abi` nor `tairix-caps` (see `kernel/mem/Cargo.toml`).
//!
//! # Returned shape
//!
//! [`DmaPool::alloc`] hands back a [`DmaBuffer`] carrying:
//!
//! * `virt` — the page-aligned virtual address inside the pool's
//!   window, suitable for handing to the driver's CPU-side code;
//! * `phys` — the page-aligned physical address of the same first
//!   byte, for the kernel's own view of the frames;
//! * `device_addr` — the address the device reaches that byte at: an
//!   IOVA in its node's domain when a translation unit stands between
//!   them ([`DmaTranslator`]), else the physical address;
//! * `len` — the *backing* length in bytes. Allocations are rounded
//!   up to the next power-of-two pages because the frame allocator is
//!   a buddy allocator and only guarantees physical contiguity inside
//!   a single order. Drivers consume `len`, not the original request
//!   — analogous to `Vec::capacity` vs the constructor argument.
//!
//! # Guard model
//!
//! Each live allocation occupies *(2 + `data_pages`)* consecutive slots
//! in the pool's virtual window: a leading guard slot, the data
//! slots, then a trailing guard slot. Guard slots are intentionally
//! **left unmapped** in the [`AddressSpace`] so that the MMU faults on
//! a register-block over-run instead of letting it reach a
//! neighbouring allocation, exactly mirroring the convention used by
//! [`crate::slab`].
//!
//! # CPU access
//!
//! A driver's CPU-side code and the device both touch the buffer's
//! *physical frames*. The CPU reaches them through the kernel's direct
//! physical map ([`crate::phys::PhysMap`]): [`DmaPool::bytes`],
//! [`DmaPool::bytes_mut`], and [`DmaPool::slot_base`] translate the
//! buffer's `phys` into a pointer, so the bytes the driver reads are
//! exactly the bytes the device wrote — not a disconnected copy.
//!
//! # Zero-on-free
//!
//! [`DmaPool::free`] zeroes every byte of the data region through the
//! `zeroize` crate's volatile clear **before** the frames are returned to the
//! [`FrameAllocator`]. The driver may not see leftover bytes in a
//! later allocation, and a forensic dump of free physical memory
//! cannot recover the credentials the buffer once held.
