//! Per-process memory-mapped-I/O register-window mapper.
//!
//! A bus driver (`lib/pci`, `drivers/bus/mmio`) that has
//! discovered a device's register block needs that block mapped into
//! its address space before it can touch a single register. This
//! module owns the architecture-neutral half of that mapping: it
//! takes a device *physical* address range and installs a
//! caching-disabled mapping for it inside a per-process
//! [`AddressSpace<P>`], handing back an [`MmioRegion`] describing the
//! result.
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::dma::DmaPool`], this mapper does **not** allocate
//! frames from the [`crate::frame::FrameAllocator`]: the physical
//! address is fixed by the hardware (a PCI BAR, a virtio-MMIO slot),
//! so the mapper maps the *device's own* frames. It shares the rest
//! of the DMA pool's discipline:
//!
//! * Guard pages bracket every mapped window so a driver that walks
//!   off the end of a register block faults instead of poking a
//!   neighbouring device.
//! * Mapping failure is reported through a [`Result`]; no path panics.
//!
//! The capability check (`CapabilityId::MMIO_MAP`) lives in
//! `kernel/sec::mmio`, since `kernel/mem` deliberately depends on
//! neither `tairix-abi` nor `tairix-caps` (see `kernel/mem/Cargo.toml`).
//!
//! # CPU access
//!
//! On real hardware the mapped bytes are the device's registers,
//! reachable from the CPU through the kernel's direct physical map
//! ([`crate::phys::PhysMap`]). [`MmioMap::region_base`] translates the
//! region's device physical base into a pointer, so the
//! `RegisterWindow` a driver touches addresses the device's own
//! registers — in production via the boot identity map, in host tests
//! via a `SimPhysMap` standing in for the register
//! block, exactly mirroring [`crate::dma::DmaPool`].
