//! The `ramzip` tier: compress-out, fault-in, clustering, warm-up, and
//! escalation (`plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` sections 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13).
//!
//! [`Ramzip`] owns the RAM-resident pool of sealed compressed pages and
//! every policy gate around it. A page enters through
//! [`Ramzip::compress_out`] only when the pressure handoff is open, the
//! eligibility classifier admits it, the owning task is not thrashing,
//! the band cap and per-task share have room, and the decompression
//! floor stays untouched — every refusal is a typed
//! [`CompressRefusal`], never a panic. A page leaves through
//! [`Ramzip::fault_in`] (move-only: restore, then delete the blob), or
//! through the strictly budgeted [`Ramzip::cluster_after_fault`] and
//! [`Ramzip::warm_step`] optimisations that run only when memory is
//! comfortably free and stop instantly when it is not.
//!
//! The compressed-entry marker is architecture-neutral by
//! construction: an entry is keyed by `(address-space id, page)` in the
//! tier while the page is simply absent from the owning
//! [`AddressSpace`]; no architecture PTE encoding leaks here.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! The tier is a plain `&mut self` state machine, like
//! [`crate::live::LiveSpace`]: the caller holds it behind its own lock,
//! and the space's lock excludes every other mutation of the space. The
//! space's other threads may still be running, so compress-out takes a
//! page out of every view before reading it, and a restore fills a frame
//! nothing reaches until it is mapped.
