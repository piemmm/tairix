//! Retained live user address space — the production target the
//! `mem_map` / `mmio_map` syscall producers mutate (`plans/PI.md` P10
//! chunk 5d-0-ii (b′); the `plans/SPAWN.md` `SP5b` production follow-on).
//!
//! Post-spawn an address space was previously captured only as an immutable
//! [`FrozenAddressSpace`] snapshot — enough
//! for the read-only user-memory copy path, but the live arch
//! [`AddressSpace<P>`] was *dropped*. `mem_map` / `mmio_map` need the
//! *running* space to stay **mutable** so a process can grow its own heap or
//! a driver can map a granted device window into its own address space.
//!
//! This module is that retained, mutable space, behind one object-safe
//! boundary so `kernel/core` can hold it without naming a concrete
//! page-table backend `P`:
//!
//! * [`LiveUserSpace`] — the object-safe, mutating operations the producers
//!   reach (anonymous map/unmap; device-window map). `Send` so the boxed
//!   space can move into the process's shared, spin-locked `ProcessSpace`
//!   (`kernel/core`), whose threads may run on any CPU; it is deliberately
//!   **not** `Sync`, because that lock — not an ambient one-task-per-space
//!   assumption — is what makes the `&mut` its methods take non-aliasing.
//! * [`LiveSpace`] — the generic concrete implementation over a port's
//!   [`PageTable`] backend `P`, the kernel direct map `M`, the kernel
//!   [`FrameAllocator`] (anonymous frames), and an [`MmioWindowMap`]
//!   (device windows). It composes the already-audited
//!   [`map_anonymous`] / [`unmap_anonymous`] and
//!   [`MmioWindowMap`] mechanisms — there is no second mapping path
//!   (one definition each).
//!
//! The capability posture (`mem_map` is unprivileged, the `mmio_map` grant
//! is owner-checked) and the placement of a
//! non-`FIXED` anonymous region belong to the higher-level `kernel/core`
//! producer that calls these — this layer knows only the page table, the
//! direct map, the frame allocator, and the device-window allocator.
