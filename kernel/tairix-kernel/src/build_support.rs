//! Pure build-support logic shared by the `tairix-kernel` build script.
//!
//! This file is pulled in by `build.rs` as a `#[path]` module (so the
//! build script has no dependency to pull in) and is *also* compiled
//! into the crate's host test build as a module, so the same rules are
//! unit tested rather than only exercised implicitly by a cross-compile
//! (tests are part of the change).
//!
//! It holds two kinds of build-time fact: the target-selection logic
//! (which instruction set / boot linker script a build is for) and the
//! [`KERNEL_DRIVER_SIGNING_SEED`] — the single source of the driver-load
//! trust-anchor seed. Because a `#[path]` include carries no dependency,
//! every build that must sign a driver manifest with the *same* key the
//! kernel trusts — the kernel's own `build.rs` and any out-of-tree fixture
//! or image build that lays a kernel-trusted bundle into the driver store —
//! reads the seed from here rather than carrying its own copy.
//!
//! Every decision the build script makes about *which* instruction set
//! the production kernel is being built for, and *which* per-board boot
//! linker script to hand `rustc`, lives here as a pure function of the
//! Cargo-provided target strings. Keeping it target-string-driven — not
//! a target-conditional `cfg` predicate — is what lets the build script
//! (the build-glue carve-out) make the instruction-set
//! choice in one audited place instead of leaking that predicate into
//! the crate body, which `cargo xtask cfg-check` forbids outside the
//! architecture ports and the build glue.
