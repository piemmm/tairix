//! The kernel-resident `/System` driver-store IPC **server**
//! (Design D D2b-2c — `plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! The disk-owning driver-store kthread (`crate::shared_block::DriverStoreService`)
//! keeps the read-only signed-bundle `/System` volume mounted for the life
//! of the system. The reactive user-space
//! device manager (`userland/system/devmgr`) reaches that volume through a
//! single capability-gated synchronous IPC call endpoint — the
//! [`tairix_abi::SyscallNumber::IPC_CALL`] surface served by a
//! [`tairix_kernel_ipc::CallEndpoint`] this server drains.
//!
//! This module is the arch-neutral half of that server: it owns no device
//! and no scheduling, only the request→reply translation. [`build_reply`]
//! decodes one [`tairix_abi::driver_store::StoreRequest`] and serves it
//! against a [`SystemFileService`]: a
//! [`StoreRequest::Catalogue`] scans the signed store and frames one opaque
//! `bundle_id` + decoded bind keys per bundle, while a
//! [`StoreRequest::Load`] runs
//! the signed gate and spawns the matched driver with only its node's
//! grants. The answer is framed with the shared
//! [`tairix_abi::driver_store`] wire encoders. [`serve_pending`] glues that
//! to the endpoint: drain one received call, build its reply, reply, and
//! wake the parked caller. The per-arch kthread loop
//! (`crate::aarch64::root_unlock`) calls [`serve_pending`] between parks.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! Every refusal — a malformed request, a read outside the store, a reply
//! that will not fit the endpoint's bound — is delivered **in band** as a
//! status-framed error reply, never a truncated
//! payload and never a panic. The server adds no authority of its own:
//! every capability and check stays in `kernel/core` behind the
//! [`SystemFileService`] delegation.
