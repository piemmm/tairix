//! The read-only `/System` file service (Design D, D2b-1 —
//! `plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! Under Design D the one disk the bootstrap floor brought up is owned for
//! the life of the system by the never-returning driver-store kthread
//! (`crate::shared_block::DriverStoreService`, D2a-2), which keeps the
//! read-only signed-bundle `/System` volume mounted. Everything that reads that volume — the in-kernel driver
//! autoload today, and the user-space `devmgr` over an IPC endpoint in
//! D2b-2 — needs exactly two operations against it: **list** the
//! `/System/Drivers/` store and **read** a bundle's bytes.
//!
//! This module is the one object that offers both: [`SystemFileService`]
//! owns a window onto the mounted `/System` volume's filesystem driver and
//! exposes [`SystemFileService::list_store`] (the store-directory walk) and
//! the [`ImageSource`] read the signed-load pipeline pulls each bundle's
//! bytes through. It consolidates the two helpers the boot path previously
//! wired ad hoc — [`tairix_kernel_core::enumerate_driver_store`] for the
//! listing and the now-removed `VfsImageSource` for the reads — behind a
//! single seam, so D2b-2 wraps *this* service in the
//! `IPC_RECV` loop rather than re-deriving the read path.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! The read itself belongs in `kernel/core`, which owns the root-mount
//! builder and the-checked per-inode delegation
//! ([`tairix_kernel_core::DriverImageReader`]) — but the [`ImageSource`]
//! trait lives in `userland/system/drvhost`, and the charter forbids `kernel/core`
//! from depending on a userland crate. The bin crate is the one layer that
//! may name `drvhost`, so this service lives here and
//! simply *delegates* to the kernel-core reader and store walk, adding no
//! authority of its own. Every capability and check stays in
//! `kernel/core`, which fails closed.
//!
//! # Borrow model
//!
//! The volume's filesystem driver needs `&mut` access per operation, but
//! [`ImageSource::read`] takes `&self`, so the driver is held behind a
//! [`RefCell`]. The two operations are strictly sequential and
//! single-threaded — the autoload lists the store once, then reads one
//! bundle at a time — so the borrow never overlaps. The root-backed VFS the
//! reader uses is built once at [`SystemFileService::open`].
