//! The manifest-requested capability list of every embedded program the
//! runtime `spawn` syscall resolves, and of PID 1 `init`
//! (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU2).
//!
//! Each list is a program's **request** — the manifest side of the
//! `user ceiling ∩ manifest request` intersection the admit path derives a
//! child's effective set from — sized to every gated syscall the program
//! has a code path to issue, **including capability-gated optional
//! features that degrade gracefully when the intersection strips them**
//! (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` §4.5, CU7). Requesting wide is not a grant
//! (the account ceiling bounds every session process — that intersection
//! is the security boundary), but an *unexercised* request is unaudited
//! surface, so a capability no code path uses stays out. The manifest
//! describes what the code *can* do; the ceiling describes what the user
//! *may* do. The registry rows in `spawn_layout` consume these lists; the
//! unit tests below pin each one, so a manifest change is a reviewed diff,
//! never an accident.
//!
//! The lists are pure data, free of the baked `rxe` fixtures the registry
//! rows carry, so they compile — and their pinning tests run — on the CI
//! host under `cargo test` as well as on each freestanding production
//! build whose registry consumes them, and on no other configuration, so
//! they are never dead code.
