//! x86_64 message-signalled-interrupt (MSI/MSI-X) routing.
//!
//! An MSI is an *edge* interrupt a device delivers as a memory write to the
//! local-APIC doorbell, carrying the target vector in its data word. Unlike
//! a legacy `INTx` line it is **not** wired to an IO-APIC pin, so it has no
//! redirection entry to mask and no level to re-assert: a single edge is
//! delivered once, and the ready-flag consume in
//! [`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::try_wait_step`] is the whole re-arm
//! interlock.
//!
//! Modelling an MSI as if it were an IO-APIC pin is wrong and was the cause
//! of the x86_64 root-disk bring-up hang (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D7): the
//! bring-up reused the interrupt-line pin's vector for the device's MSI-X
//! message, so the one edge source and a level IO-APIC redirection entry
//! shared a vector, and the fire/mask/re-arm path drove the wrong (pinned,
//! level) controller for an edge source. Linux avoids this by allocating a
//! **dedicated** vector for each MSI from a separate vector domain with an
//! MSI `irq_chip` whose mask/unmask never touch the IO-APIC; the aarch64
//! port does the same with its virtual `MSI_LINE_BASE` range and
//! `CompositeIrqController`. This module is the x86_64 equivalent.
//!
//! Three pieces:
//!
//! * [`MSI_LINE_BASE`] — the base of a virtual interrupt-line range that sits
//!   far above any real IO-APIC GSI, so an MSI line and a GSI can never
//!   alias. A driver binds an MSI line in the kernel
//!   [`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable`] exactly as it would a GSI.
//! * [`CompositeIrqController`] — the one line→controller fan-out
//!   [`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::fire`] and the `irq_wait`/completion re-arm
//!   path drive: a real GSI masks/unmasks the [`IoApicController`] redirection
//!   entry; an MSI line is an edge source with **no** hardware line to mask, so
//!   its mask/re-arm are honest no-ops (the ready-flag consume is the
//!   interlock, and the runaway-interrupt safety net in
//!   [`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable`] still contains a storming vector). This is
//!   published as the routing controller so the kernel core and the device-IRQ
//!   dispatch both reach it.
//! * The allocator (`install_msi_lines` + `allocate`) — claims a
//!   dedicated [`MsiVector`] `(vector, line)` pair for a device that will
//!   deliver MSI/MSI-X. The free external vectors above the IO-APIC pins are
//!   pre-installed in the IDT and pre-published in the arch routing table as
//!   MSI lines at boot (`install_msi_lines`), so a runtime allocation is a
//!   lock-free bitmap claim that never mutates the IDT — the vector is ready
//!   to deliver the instant a device is programmed with it.
