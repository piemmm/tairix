//! Bare-metal boot pipeline for the x86_64 `tairix-kernel` binary.
//!
//! [`boot`] is the single entry point. It is called from each
//! binary's `extern "C" fn kernel_main(boot_info: u64)` after the
//! arch crate's [`tairix_arch_x86_64::entry`] trampoline has validated
//! the boot magic (multiboot2 or PVH) and recorded the protocol. It
//! performs the BSP bring-up
//! sequence the prompt for Stage 3a (c7-bin) lays out — boot info →
//! ACPI/MADT → `BootMemoryMap`; `X86_64Arch::new`; per-CPU
//! `percpu::init` → `preempt::init_local_preempt` →
//! `syscall_entry::init_local_syscalls`; install the fail-closed
//! syscall-dispatch callback **before** `syscall` is enabled — and
//! then hands a fully-validated [`tairix_kernel_core::BootInfo`] to
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::kernel_main`].
//!
//! # SAFETY-INVARIANTs
//!
//! Each step of [`boot`] is the unsafe shim into one of the
//! architecture port's audited primitives. The invariants the arch
//! crate documents on those primitives are upheld here:
//!
//! * `percpu::init(0)` runs exactly once with interrupts disabled
//!   (the boot trampoline leaves `IF` clear, and we never `sti`
//!   ourselves — `kernel_core::kernel_main` halts at the end of
//!   `BootCompleted`).
//! * `set_dispatch_callback` is invoked **before**
//!   `init_local_syscalls`, satisfying the trampoline's "callback
//!   installed before `syscall` is enabled" requirement (see
//!   `tairix_arch_x86_64::syscall_entry` rustdoc and).
//! * `init_local_preempt`, `init_local_syscalls` and
//!   `set_cpu_id_for_lapic` run with `cpu_index = 0` on the BSP after
//!   `percpu::init(0)`, satisfying their per-call SAFETY contracts.
//! * The boot-info pointer is dereferenced only through the audited
//!   `bootinfo::BootData::load` validator, which bounds every slice
//!   before parsing (the multiboot2 `total_size`, the PVH stated
//!   entry count).
//!
//! # No `unwrap` / `expect` / `panic!` in production paths
//!
//! the charter forbids panics in production paths. Every fallible
//! step inside [`boot`] returns a [`BootError`]; the outer function
//! reports the failure through the log sink and halts the CPU
//! forever via [`tairix_arch_x86_64::kernel_arch::halt`]. The CPU
//! never returns to the trampoline (the boot stub assumes
//! `kernel_main` does not return — `boot.s` SAFETY-INVARIANT 7).
