//! The x86_64 (QEMU `q35`/`pc`, UEFI-class PC) live root-unlock bring-up
//! (`plans/ARCHSUPPORT.md` A2).
//!
//! The freestanding-x86_64 half of the in-kernel root-unlock service, the
//! cross-port sibling of [`crate::riscv64::root_unlock`] and
//! [`crate::aarch64::root_unlock`]. It lives in the architecture subtree
//! because it names the x86_64 port directly (the PCI configuration-access
//! mechanism, MSI-X interrupt routing, the `hlt` CPU park); the device- and
//! architecture-independent two-task tail — the spawned interactive unlock
//! and the persistent driver-store serve loop — stays in the shared
//! [`crate::unlock_orchestrate::finish_unlock`].
//!
//! It admits the in-kernel root-unlock kthread at the init seam, brings the
//! bootstrap virtio-blk-PCI root device up over the production MSI-X
//! interrupt path, and hands the opened disk to the shared tail. The only
//! floor block driver on the QEMU PC target is virtio-blk (there is no
//! directly-described SD host as on the Raspberry Pi), so there is one
//! bring-up.
//!
//! # Interrupt delivery: MSI-X on a dedicated MSI vector
//!
//! A modern virtio-PCI function delivers through MSI-X: the device writes a
//! chosen LAPIC vector directly to the local-APIC doorbell, an *edge*
//! message that never uses an IO-APIC pin. The bring-up allocates a
//! **dedicated** MSI vector + virtual interrupt line ([`crate::x86_64::msi`])
//! for the device — never an IO-APIC pin's vector — binds that MSI line in
//! the kernel [`IrqTable`], builds the MSI message from it, and routes it
//! into the device's MSI-X table. The line's controller half is the edge
//! no-op in [`crate::x86_64::msi::CompositeIrqController`]: there is no pin
//! to mask before the wake or to re-arm after it, so the ready-flag consume
//! is the whole interlock, exactly as an MSI's edge semantics require. (The
//! legacy PCI Interrupt-Line register is an `INTx` hint and is meaningless
//! once MSI-X is enabled, so it is not read.)
