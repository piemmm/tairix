//! Production syscall-dispatch callback for the `tairix-kernel` binary.
//!
//! # Two-stage callback ABI
//!
//! The x86_64 syscall trampoline shipped by
//! [`tairix_arch_x86_64::syscall_entry`] expects a bare `extern "C"`
//! function pointer of the [`SyscallDispatchFn`] type. The trampoline
//! itself fail-closes via `tairix_arch_x86_64::qemu_exit::exit_failure`
//! if it ever fires before the callback is installed
//! ([`set_dispatch_callback`] documents that contract); the bin crate
//! must call `set_dispatch_callback` **before** `init_local_syscalls`
//! enables `syscall` on any CPU (fail closed).
//!
//! Stage 2.7 follow-up (f5) replaces the previous fail-closed body
//! with [`production_dispatch`]. The callback no longer halts on first
//! syscall: it reads the per-binary [`DISPATCH_SLOT`] (published by
//! `kernel_core::kernel_main` during the `Syscall` init phase, see
//! `docs/src/architecture/kernel.md` "Syscall registration phase"),
//! forwards the call through the resident `DispatchHook`, and
//! encodes the [`DispatchOutcome`](tairix_kernel_core::DispatchOutcome) back into the architecture's
//! syscall-return register.
//!
//! The trampoline-level `set_dispatch_callback` ordering is
//! unchanged: the bin crate still installs the callback before
//! `syscall` is enabled (see `boot.rs::try_boot` step 7); the slot
//! is the *second* publication channel and is filled in by
//! `kernel_main` between `Phase::Sched` and `Phase::Ipc`.
//!
//! # Fail-closed branches
//!
//! 1. The slot is empty — a syscall fired before `kernel_main`
//!    published the hook. That cannot happen once user space runs (the
//!    dispatcher is installed first), but the callback must not assume
//!    so, and there is no hook to route a kill through, so it halts the
//!    CPU via [`tairix_arch_x86_64::kernel_arch::halt`].
//! 2. The hook returned [`DispatchOutcome::NoCallerContext`](tairix_kernel_core::DispatchOutcome::NoCallerContext) —
//!    `Scheduler::current_task` returned `None` (no task is running on
//!    the issuing CPU) or the running task has no `TaskCapabilities`
//!    record. The unattributable ring-3 context is killed and the CPU
//!    keeps running; `KernelDispatchHook` has already emitted an
//!    `AuditEvent::SyscallNoCallerContext` record, so the security
//!    signal is durable on the audit channel. Halting here instead
//!    would let a ring-3 trap strand the locks and device interrupts
//!    that CPU holds.
//!
//! Production never returns an unspecified value to user space (no
//! `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths; the bottom-typed
//! halt is the documented contract for the empty slot).
//!
