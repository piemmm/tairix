//! In-crate [`KernelArch`] wrapper around
//! [`tairix_arch_x86_64::kernel_arch::X86_64Arch`].
//!
//! # Why a wrapper
//!
//! `tairix_kernel_core::KernelArch` is a foreign trait and
//! `tairix_arch_x86_64::kernel_arch::X86_64Arch` is a foreign type, so
//! Rust's coherence rules forbid implementing the trait for the type
//! directly. The wrapper [`BinArch`] is the smallest possible local
//! type that owns an `X86_64Arch`, implements the
//! [`tairix_kernel_sched_api::SchedulerArch`] super-trait by delegation,
//! and implements [`tairix_kernel_core::KernelArch::halt`] by
//! forwarding to the free function
//! [`tairix_arch_x86_64::kernel_arch::halt`].
//!
//! The arch crate's
//! `kernel/arch/x86_64/Cargo.toml` comment explicitly documents this
//! split: pulling `tairix-kernel-core` into the arch crate would
//! transitively force a `#[global_allocator]` into the two pre-existing
//! freestanding Stage-2 QEMU test bins.
