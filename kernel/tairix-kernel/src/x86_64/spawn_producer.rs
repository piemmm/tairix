//! x86_64 runtime `spawn` producer — `plans/PI.md` `X3b`.
//!
//! [`X86_64ProcessSpawn`] implements the architecture-neutral
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::ArchImageBuilder`] seam the boot pipeline installs
//! into the [`tairix_kernel_core::BootInfo`] hand-off (`boot::try_boot` →
//! `BootInfo::with_spawn`). It is the cross-port sibling of the aarch64
//! `spawn_producer` (`plans/SPAWN.md` `SP3b`): when a task that holds
//! `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` issues the `spawn` syscall, the kernel resolves the
//! requested path against the shared
//! [`crate::spawn_layout::PROGRAM_REGISTRY`], admits a parked **loading**
//! child, and returns its PID at once. On the child's own first scheduled
//! slice this producer's
//! [`build`](tairix_kernel_core::ArchImageBuilder::build) builds it a *fresh,
//! hardware-isolated* PML4 hierarchy and populates it through the production
//! capability-checked, audited spawn caller ([`spawn_image`], gated on
//! `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`). Unlike the PID-1 [`tairix_kernel_core::InitSpawn`] seam
//! (`init_spawn_x86_64.rs`) it does **not** switch CR3 or enter ring 3 from
//! the caller: the spawning caller keeps running under its own root, and the
//! child enters ring 3 from its own loading body when the scheduler next steps
//! it (a true concurrent, non-blocking spawn, not an `exec`-style hand-off).
//!
//! # Building the child without switching CR3
//!
//! The runtime `spawn` syscall is issued by PID 1 `init`, so the producer runs
//! under PID 1's own root, which [`init_spawn`](crate::x86_64::init_spawn)
//! built with [`ArchAddressSpace::new_process_root`]: the higher-half kernel
//! window plus the direct physical map, and no identity map. Every table the
//! walk recovers and every image frame it writes is reached through that map
//! ([`ConfiguredPhysMap`]), which PID 1's root carries like every other root,
//! so the producer builds the child's tables *through the caller's active
//! CR3*, never switching it. The child's own CR3 is reloaded by its
//! `pre_resume` hook before the scheduler first resumes it
//! (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP2, `plans/PI.md` X1).
//!
//! Spawning is *not* a privileged bypass: the child receives only the authority
//! its registered program declares intersected with its user's grants; this seam only authorises the *act* of spawning
//! under `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`.
