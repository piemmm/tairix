//! The kernel block-device sharing layer (Design D, D2a —
//! `plans/PI.md`): one whole-disk [`Block`] device driven
//! concurrently through serialised handles.
//!
//! The boot path brings up exactly **one** bootstrap-floor block device
//! (`crate::root_storage` / `crate::aarch64::root_unlock`), yet two
//! independent consumers need to read it: the read-only signed-bundle
//! `/System` driver store (`crate::root_mount::autoload_system_drivers`)
//! and the encrypted-root unlock window
//! (`crate::root_mount::unlock_root_disk_interactively`). Until now they
//! used the one device *sequentially* — the `/System` window was borrowed,
//! dropped, then the device was moved by value into the unlock — so the
//! `/System` mount could not outlive the unlock call.
//!
//! Design D needs the `/System` store reachable for the life of the system
//! (on-demand and reactive driver loads), so the
//! one device must back **two concurrent partition windows**. This module
//! is that primitive: a [`SharedBlock`] owns the device behind a
//! scheduler-blocking [`SleepLock`] and hands out as many
//! [`SharedBlockHandle`]s as there are windows, each of which is itself a
//! [`Block`]. Every read / write / discard takes the lock for the duration
//! of the single device operation, so concurrent windows on different CPUs
//! are serialised (SMP from day one, explicit synchronisation).
//!
//! The device's [`BlockGeometry`] is immutable for the life of a disk, so
//! it is queried **once** at construction and cached: [`SharedBlock::geometry`]
//! and the handle's [`Block::geometry`] are then lock-free and infallible,
//! keeping that hot, frequently-read value off the lock. Geometry is the only cached value; every byte-moving operation
//! goes to the device under the lock.
//!
//! A **sleeping** [`SleepLock`] is required here, not a `lib/sync` spin lock:
//! a device operation may **park** the calling task across the controller's
//! completion interrupt ([`Block::read_blocks`] parks on the device IRQ), and
//! the lock is held for the duration of that operation. A spin lock held
//! across such a park is a defect — a second window contending for the same
//! disk would busy-spin on a holder that is asleep (forbidden busy-waiting),
//! or deadlock a single CPU outright. The [`SleepLock`] instead parks the
//! contending window off the run queue and wakes it when the holder releases,
//! so two concurrent windows (the `/System` driver-store window and the
//! encrypted-root unlock window) can safely drive one disk
//! (`docs/src/architecture/sync.md`).
//!
//! Architecture-neutral: the layer names no
//! device type and no architecture — it is generic over any [`Block`], so
//! every port shares this one definition and the per-device bring-up
//! (virtio-blk, EMMC2, …) wraps its brought-up device in it.

// SAFETY: `SharedBlock` is the kernel's disk-sharing boundary, and it is the

// tasks that drive it (disk access is a common,
// capability-checked kernel service, reached by the disk-owning kthread, the
// driver-store serve kthread, and the encrypted-root unlock kthread over one
// `&'static SharedBlock`). The auto-derived `Send`/`Sync` are conservatively
// withheld because a concrete `B` (e.g. `VirtioBlk`) holds raw `NonNull`
// pointers into the device's MMIO register window and DMA region. Asserting
// `Send + Sync` here is sound because:
//   1. **Exclusive access.** Every byte-moving operation on the contained
//      device goes through `self.device.lock()` (the cached `geometry` and
//      `class` are the only lock-free fields, and both are immutable `Copy`
//      values), so `B` is never touched by two tasks at once — there is no
//      data race on `B`'s interior, including any non-atomic bookkeeping it
//      keeps. The `SleepLock` grants exclusive ownership for the whole
//      operation, even one held across a completion-IRQ park, parking a
//      second contender rather than spinning.
//   2. **Location-independent backing.** `B`'s `!Send` parts are raw pointers
//      into globally-valid device memory: an MMIO register window and a DMA
//      slab, both reachable from any CPU/task through the kernel's identity
//      map. They are not tied to the task that mapped them, so moving the
//      handle's *reference* between tasks observes the same device bytes.
//   3. **Lifetime.** A `&'static SharedBlock` only ever wraps a device whose
//      backing was boot-leaked to `'static` (`kernel/tairix-kernel`'s
//      `root_unlock`), so the device and its pointers outlive every handle.
// This is the irreducible `unsafe` for in-kernel device sharing; it is
// confined to this one boundary type rather than scattered across the virtio
// transport/host (encapsulated behind a safe API).
