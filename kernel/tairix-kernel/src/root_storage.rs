//! The root-storage bind gate (`plans/PI.md` §3 P11 root-mount increment,
//! Chunk B-2): resolve which **discovered** hardware-tree node carries the
//! bootstrap root block device, and which floor block driver binds it.
//!
//! The kernel does not *hunt* for a disk, it
//! binds a block driver because that driver's signed bind table matched a
//! discovered node's identity. The match is the
//! one shared `lib/devmatch` policy the user-space `devmgr` autoloader also
//! uses, applied against the bootstrap-floor catalogue
//! ([`crate::driver_catalog`]) — the only drivers compiled into the kernel,
//! the storage path that must exist before the signed driver store under
//! `/System/Drivers/` is reachable.
//!
//! The gate is **resolution only** — it never reads, mounts, or trusts a
//! volume (the signed load gate and the mount path do that). It is
//! the front half the root-mount composition ([`crate::root_mount`]) builds
//! on: once a block device is bound here, the bring-up maps its windows
//! through an in-kernel `DriverHost`, mounts the filesystem, and loads the
//! users database.
//!
//! # Discovery vs. bus enumeration
//!
//! A device that the firmware tree describes directly — the Raspberry Pi 4
//! EMMC2 SD host (`compatible = "brcm,bcm2711-emmc2"`) — binds straight from
//! the discovered tree. A device behind a bus that must be *probed* — a
//! virtio-blk disk, whose bind key is the virtio device id read from the
//! transport, not a `compatible` string — appears only after the bus driver
//! enumerates it and attaches the probed child node.
//! This gate resolves whatever the tree it is handed contains: the raw
//! firmware tree on a direct-attached board, or the post-enumeration tree
//! once a bus driver has attached its children.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! A tree with no block device leaves the root unbound (logged, never a
//! panic). A tree with **more than one** distinct block device is
//! ambiguous: which volume is the root is a policy decision that needs an
//! explicit boot descriptor, not a guess, so the gate fails closed (binds
//! nothing) rather than picking one. Every outcome is audited under a
//! stable `ROOT_STORAGE_AUTOLOAD` event id.
