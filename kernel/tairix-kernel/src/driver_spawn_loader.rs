//! Production driver-load mechanism that spawns a verified driver into its
//! own user-space process (`plans/PI.md` P10 5d-2-ii; PLAN Stage 4.HW item
//! 5).
//!
//! [`crate::driver_loader`] admits an *in-kernel* driver through the signed
//! `drvhost::Host::load` gate and completes registration with an in-process
//! `register()` call. This module is its user-space sibling: a driver whose
//! manifest is `kind = UserSpace` is admitted through the *same* signed gate
//! — Ed25519 signature against the build's trust anchor, the `CAP_DRV_LOAD`
//! gate, the syscall-table-hash match, and bind-table validation — and then
//! **spawned into its own hardware-isolated process** rather than run in the
//! kernel's domain (drivers in user space wherever
//! feasible; leaf drivers live in the discovered tier).
//!
//! The crucial security property this module realises is: *a loaded
//! driver receives only the resource capabilities its matched node
//! requested.* The device manager forwards the matched hardware-tree node's
//! [`HwResource`] requests through the [`tairix_devmgr::DriverLoader`] seam;
//! [`SpawnDriverLoader::load`] threads them, unchanged, into the privileged
//! spawn, which mints the new process one unforgeable, owner-checked grant
//! per resource and nothing more (`KernelSpawnCtx`'s `grants` field — see
//! [`DriverProcessSpawn`]). The resources originate kernel-side, from the
//! kernel's own discovered hardware tree, never from an untrusted caller
//! (no ambient authority), so spawning a driver can never
//! hand it authority over a window its node did not expose.
//!
//! # The architecture seam
//!
//! Creating a process is architecture-specific (it builds a fresh page-table
//! hierarchy and admits a kthread on the running CPU), so this module keeps
//! the load *policy* (the gate + the resource threading) architecture-neutral
//! and reaches the *mechanism* through the [`DriverProcessSpawn`] trait. A
//! concrete implementation builds a `KernelSpawnCtx` over the live kernel
//! subsystems and admits the driver through the architecture's
//! `ProcessSpawn::spawn_with` path; because that names kernel/core's
//! feature-selected concrete scheduler (which the production binary
//! deliberately never names), the aarch64 implementation lives with
//! its consumer — the `-M virt` driver-autoload vertical — exactly as that
//! vertical already names the concrete scheduler to build the rest of the
//! kernel state. Host tests here supply a recording double, so the gate and
//! resource-threading logic are exercised on the CI host without a scheduler.
