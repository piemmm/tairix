//! The write-back flusher kthread: the kernel task that publishes a volume
//! whose batched filesystem transaction has aged out
//! (`plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` §10).
//!
//! The policy — which volume is due, in what order, and what a failed
//! publish means — is arch-neutral and lives in
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::fs::writeback`]. This module is the wiring: it hands
//! the mount registry to every driver as its write-back timer and admits one
//! long-lived kthread that parks on
//! [`WRITEBACK_WAITQ`] between
//! deadlines.
//!
//! # Deferral is enabled only once the flusher can fire it
//!
//! The flusher arms deferral itself, from its own body, once it has proved it
//! can register on the queue and be woken, and then parks for the life of the
//! system. Until then the host declines to read its clock and every driver
//! publishes at each operation exactly as it did before batching existed. So a
//! transaction can never be held against a timer that will not come back for
//! it, whatever fails: a port with no storage floor, a service that was not
//! admitted, a scheduler hook that is not wired.
