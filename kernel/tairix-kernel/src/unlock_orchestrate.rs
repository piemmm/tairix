//! Architecture-neutral root-unlock / driver-store orchestration
//! (`plans/PI.md` design B).
//!
//! Every Tier-1 port that brings a bootstrap-floor root block device up
//! feeds it into the *same* two-task tail: the one brought-up disk is shared
//! for the life of the system by two independent preemptive tasks — a spawned
//! interactive encrypted-root unlock, and the persistent driver-store serve
//! loop the user-space `devmgr` reads signed `/System` drivers through. That
//! tail is device- and architecture-independent, so it lives here rather than
//! being copied into each `kernel/arch/<target>/` sibling: a port supplies
//! only its bring-up, its console-0 seam ([`UnlockConsole`]), and its
//! process-spawn producer, and calls [`finish_unlock`].
//!
//! The two hardware-specific seams a port injects:
//!
//! * [`UnlockConsole`] — the primary-console (index 0) write + raw-read pair
//!   the passphrase prompt uses, plus the release-to-`login` handoff the
//!   moment the unlock resolves. A framebuffer-vs-UART decision, an
//!   interrupt-driven receive arm, and the console-0 ownership gate are all
//!   the port's business; the orchestration only asks for a console and to
//!   release it.
//! * [`tairix_kernel_core::ArchImageBuilder`] — the architecture's process
//!   image producer, bridged through the arch-neutral
//!   [`crate::driver_spawn_loader::InitCtxDriverProcessSpawn`] so a matched
//!   user-space driver is spawned into its own hardware-isolated process
//!   granted exactly its matched node's resources (no ambient authority).
