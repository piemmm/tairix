//! block disks, and the interrupt-driven input/network devices a
//! user-space driver autoloads against. They are **pure discovery**: they

//! seams, name no concrete `drivers/bus/*` type, and never read, mount, or
//! bind a driver.
//!
//! They live here, apart from the root-block *catalogue resolution*
//! ([`crate::root_storage`], which links the in-kernel `driver_catalog` /
//! `drvhost`), so that discovering hardware never drags the driver-signing
//! trust anchor in with it: an architecture whose boot path builds a
//! hardware tree (over its own FDT/ACPI source) reuses these observers
//! without linking the catalogue. Input and network devices are
//! discovered by one shared core (`observe_virtio_mmio_interrupt_devices`);
