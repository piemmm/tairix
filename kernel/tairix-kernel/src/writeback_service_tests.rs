//! End-to-end host tests for the write-back expiry timer over a **real**
//! ARXFS volume (`plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` §10).
//!
//! The write-back policy's own tests live beside it in
//! `tairix_kernel_core::fs::writeback` and drive a spy driver. What they
//! cannot prove is the property the whole item exists for: that a volume
//! which batched a commit and then went quiet is *published* by the timer,
//! with no further operation on the driver. That needs the driver, the
//! registry, and the timer wired together, which is exactly this crate.
//!
//! Publication is read off the **medium**, not off the driver: the device's
//! image is shared with the test, so each assertion re-opens the bytes the
//! device currently holds exactly as a remount after a power cut would, and
//! finds the name published or absent. A driver's own answer would prove
//! nothing here — it would serve its own staged blocks either way.
//!
//! The clock is the test's own, because a host build installs no scheduler
//! clock: the fixture registry is its own write-back host, reading a settable
//! reading and forwarding the deadlines the driver reports. That is the shape
//! production uses — `LATE_FILESYSTEM` installs itself — with the one
//! substitution the host build forces.
