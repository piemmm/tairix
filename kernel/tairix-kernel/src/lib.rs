//! TAIRiX microkernel binary support library (Stage 3a (c7-bin)).
//!
//! This is the library half of the `tairix-kernel` crate. It carries the
//! per-instruction-set boot pipelines that are reusable across the
//! production binary (`src/main.rs`) and the QEMU integration tests.
//! Pulling a pipeline into a library is the only way to satisfy
//! (no duplication) without leaking the test-only
//! audit-observer sink into the production binary through Cargo feature
//! unification.
//!
//! The build script (`build.rs`) selects the pipeline per instruction set
//! via the `kernel_isa` conditional-compilation name, so the production
//! kernel image is built for exactly one architecture at a time (the
//! single selection point): the x86_64
//! Multiboot2/ACPI pipeline or the aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4) boot path.
//!

//! # Why this is a library, not a `[[bin]]`
//!
//! Two consumers exist:
//!
//! 1. The production binary in `src/main.rs`.
//! 2. The QEMU integration test in
//!    `tests/integration/kernel_arch_boot/src/main.rs`, which supplies
//!    its own audit sink (one that flips the QEMU debug-exit device on
//!    `AuditEvent::BootCompleted`).
//!
//! Both consumers share the same boot pipeline — but they must *not*
//! share the audit sink, because exiting QEMU on `BootCompleted` is
//! a test-harness affordance that has no place in a production kernel
//! (fail closed; the harness never decides what
//! the kernel does next).
//!
//! # `no_std`
//!
//! `no_std` is mandatory: every consumer of this library is a
//! freestanding bare-metal binary (`x86_64-tairix-none` or
//! `aarch64-unknown-none`). `extern crate alloc` is pulled in because
//! the architecture-neutral [`tairix_kernel_core::BootInfo`] hand-off
//! type holds an `Arc<KernelArch>`.

#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// `alloc` is consumed by the bare-metal-only [`boot`] module which
// constructs an `Arc<BinArch>` for `kernel_core::BootInfo`. The
// `extern crate` declaration must live here at the crate root for the
// `boot` module to resolve `alloc::sync::Arc`; on host builds the
// declaration shows up as unused (`boot` is gated to the
// `freestanding` build) but stripping it would break the bare-metal
// build.
