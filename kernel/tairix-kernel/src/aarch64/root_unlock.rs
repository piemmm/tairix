//! The aarch64 live root-unlock bring-up (`plans/PI.md` P11 Chunk B-2
//! INCREMENT (2)).
//!
//! The freestanding-aarch64 half of the in-kernel root-unlock service: it
//! lives in the architecture subtree ([`crate::aarch64`]) because it names
//! the aarch64 port directly (`tairix_arch_aarch64`, the GIC, the firmware
//! device tree), while the device-independent core — the boot stash and the
//! console-0 ownership gate — stays in the arch-neutral
//! [`crate::unlock_service`].
//!
//! It admits the in-kernel unlock kthread at the init seam, brings the
//! bootstrap virtio-blk root device up over the production device-IRQ path
//! (INCREMENT (1)), and runs the device-independent unlock policy
//! ([`crate::root_mount::unlock_root_disk_interactively`]) inside the
//! kthread — opening the console-0 ownership gate the instant the unlock
//! resolves so `login` can take over
//! ([`crate::unlock_service::CONSOLE0_GATE`]).
//!
//! Two bootstrap-floor block drivers are brought up
//! here, selected by which one [`crate::root_storage`] bound: the virtio-blk
//! device over the production device-IRQ path (the QEMU `virt` / x86_64
//! root, proven on `-M virt`), or the Raspberry Pi 4 EMMC2 SD host over
//! cache-synchronized ADMA2 with a programmed-I/O fallback
//! ([`crate::driver_catalog::EMMC2_PATH`], the Pi-metal root
//! — `raspi4b` cannot model EMMC2, so it is host-tested at the driver level
//! and metal-gated here, `plans/PI.md` P8/B4). The bring-up differs per
//! device; the read-only `/System` autoload, the passphrase prompt, and the
//! interactive unlock are identical and shared in [`finish_unlock`]. A bound driver that is neither fails closed
//! (logged, gate opened, no database installed;).
