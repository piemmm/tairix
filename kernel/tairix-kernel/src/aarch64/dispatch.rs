//! Production syscall-dispatch callback for the aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4)
//! `tairix-kernel` binary — the aarch64 sibling of
//! `crate::x86_64::dispatch` (`plans/PI.md` P6c-2).
//!
//! The aarch64 `svc` trampoline shipped by
//! [`tairix_arch_aarch64::syscall_entry`] forwards each syscall to a
//! bare `extern "C"` callback of the
//! [`tairix_arch_aarch64::syscall_entry::SyscallDispatchFn`] type
//! (identical in shape to the x86_64 and riscv64 typedefs — one ABI). [`production_dispatch`] is that callback: it reads
//! the per-CPU argument frame, forwards through the resident
//! `DispatchHook` published into [`DISPATCH_SLOT`] by
//! `kernel_core::kernel_main`, and encodes the result back into `x0`.
//!
//! The arch-neutral lookup → narrow → forward → encode logic lives in
//! [`crate::dispatch_core`] and is unit-tested there once; this module
//! supplies only the two aarch64-specific facts — the
//! `SyscallDispatchFn` coercion and the bottom-typed
//! [`tairix_arch_aarch64::halt_current_cpu`] empty-slot halt.
