//! Production aarch64 device-IRQ wiring (`plans/PI.md` P11 Chunk B-2
//! INCREMENT (1)).
//!
//! Brings the kernel-wide [`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable`] to life on the
//! aarch64 boot path so a discovered device's shared-peripheral interrupt
//! (SPI) can be bound and a task parked on it is woken when the GIC
//! delivers the line. It is the aarch64 analogue of the x86_64
//! `IoApicController` + `production_external_irq_dispatch` wiring in
//! `crate::x86_64::arch_wrapper`; before it, the aarch64 port kept the
//! conservative fail-closed [`tairix_kernel_core::IrqRouting::unsupported`]
//! default and delivered no device interrupts at all.
//!
//! Three pieces compose the path the kernel core (`Phase::Irq`) drives
//! through [`tairix_kernel_core::KernelArch::irq_routing`] /
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::KernelArch::install_irq_dispatch`]:
//!
//! 1. [`GicIrqController`] — a kernel-side [`IrqController`] over the
//!    arch port's validated [`GicController`]. The arch crate cannot
//!    depend on `kernel/irq`, so the bridge from the
//!    arch HAL [`tairix_arch_api::IrqController`] to the
//!    [`tairix_kernel_irq::IrqController`] [`IrqTable::fire`] consumes
//!    lives here, in the kernel binary, exactly like the x86_64
//!    `IoApicController` does. It adds **no** masking policy of its own —
//!    it delegates to the range-checked, fence-ordered [`GicController`].
//! 2. `gic_irq_routing` — the `IrqRouting` the boot path hands
//!    [`crate::aarch64::arch_wrapper::Aarch64BinArch`], naming the
//!    `'static` `GIC_IRQ_CONTROLLER` and the GICv2 maximum INTID as the
//!    bind ceiling.
//! 3. [`install_device_irq_dispatch`] — publishes the live `IrqTable`
//!    into a set-once slot and registers `production_device_irq_dispatch`
//!    with the arch crate's EL1 IRQ-vector seam
//!    ([`tairix_arch_aarch64::exceptions::set_device_irq_dispatch`]). The
//!    EL1 IRQ handler acknowledges the GIC, forwards every non-timer INTID
//!    here, and issues the end-of-interrupt itself; this dispatcher only
//!    translates the acknowledged INTID into an [`IrqTable::fire`] (which
//!    masks the line before a waiter observes the wake —
//!    `docs/src/security/irq.md`).
//!
//! The wiring is **additive and non-regressing**: no
//! device SPI is bound or routed until INCREMENT (2)'s unlock kthread does
//! so, and `production_device_irq_dispatch` is only ever reached for a
//! non-timer INTID the GIC delivers — which cannot occur until a line is
//! routed — so the metal-confirmed boot is unaffected.

// `AtomicBool`/`Ordering` back the freestanding-only UART receive
// flow-control flag, and `IrqRouting` is returned only by the
// freestanding `gic_irq_routing`; on a host build neither is used (the
// host `KernelArch::irq_routing` returns the unsupported default from
// `arch_wrapper`), so both imports are gated to where they compile rather
// than left unused under clippy's `-D warnings`.

/// masked here (the kernel-core `Irq` phase runs with `DAIF.I` set), so no
/// tick is *taken* until EL0 runs with IRQs unmasked
/// (`crate::aarch64::userentry`'s preemptible `SPSR`) or the root-unlock
/// kthread unmasks at EL1 — the armed timer simply leaves PPI 30 pending
/// until then, so this is **additive and non-regressing**: a tick taken
/// in EL0 drives [`tairix_kernel_core::on_user_preempt_point`] immediately,
/// and a one-shot tick taken in EL1 disarms without context-switching (the
/// kernel is non-preemptible) but is latched by
/// [`tairix_kernel_core::on_timer_tick`] and honoured when the interrupted
/// syscall completes — an expired quantum is never silently lost. The
/// scheduler re-arms the next one-shot on its following dispatch.
///
/// No *scheduler-fairness* tick callback is installed: EEVDF is tickless
/// (fairness is advanced inside `Scheduler::step`, not by a periodic
/// count). The per-tick callback that *is* installed
/// ([`tairix_kernel_core::on_timer_tick`]) latches the pending preemption
/// and runs the blocking-wait timed-wake sweep (Design D P-2): it releases any
/// elapsed `hw_tree_wait`-style waiter and re-arms the one-shot to the
