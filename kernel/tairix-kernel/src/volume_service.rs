//! The runtime volume attach/detach service (`plans/DEVICES.md` D3b).
//!
//! The production [`VolumeService`] behind the `volume_attach` /
//! `volume_detach` syscalls: it connects the kernel blkio client to the
//! block-service endpoint + shared window a user-space block driver serves
//! (the USB mass-storage per-LUN nodes), windows the probed partition
//! extent, opens the matched filesystem, mounts it under its
//! `/Storage/<name>` catalog view location with the removable-media
//! flags, and publishes the volume's stable identity into the volume
//! forest so `id::<volume-id>/…` paths resolve. Detach reverses it:
//! flush, unmount, unregister, unpublish — failing closed (the volume
//! stays attached) rather than discarding uncommitted data.
//!
//! The syscall layer has already verified `CAP_FS_MOUNT` and the caller's
//! endpoint/window resource grants; this service re-validates everything
//! against live state and audits every attach/detach decision with a
//! stable event id (the drives.md `fs.hotplug.root_{added,removed}`
//! events; root publication itself flows through the shared
//! `publish_volume_identity` definition in `crate::system_mount`).
//!
//! Attach and detach are rare, whole-volume operations; they serialise on
//! one sleeping lock (they park on device I/O), so two concurrent
//! requests can never interleave a half-built volume. The attached-volume
//! registry itself lives behind a spin lock so the surprise-removal path
//! can walk it from the endpoint-teardown context without parking.
//!
//! # Surprise removal (`plans/DEVICES.md` D4)
//!
//! Every attach threads the device through a
//! [`JournaledBlock`], so the volume carries a bounded [`RetainedWrites`]
//! journal of the writes the device has accepted since its last committed
//! flush. The service implements
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::callreg::EndpointVanishObserver`]: when a
//! volume's serving block driver dies (the stick was yanked and the HCD
//! retracted its nodes), the vanished endpoint drives the transition —
//!
//! * **clean** (nothing uncommitted): the volume is simply retracted —
//!   unmounted, unregistered, unpublished — with one audit event; no
//!   drama (drives.md §10).
//! * **dirty**: the volume enters *unavailable-dirty* — the root, alias,
//!   and mount stay visible but every new operation fails closed with a
//!   typed device fault (the dead endpoint guarantees it), the retained
//!   write set is kept for the verified re-insert replay or an explicit
//!   force-discard, and the event records how many bytes are held.
//! * **lost** (retention was abandoned under the budget/pressure gate, or
//!   a failed write left the medium state unknown): *unavailable-lost*,
//!   and the event says so — uncommitted data existed that is not held.
//!
//! A plain `volume_detach` of an unavailable volume is refused: discarding
//! the retained set is the deliberate, separately-audited **force-unmount**
//! (`plans/DEVICES.md` D4b), never an implicit side effect. A force detach
//! (`VolumeDetachRequest::force`) still commits a healthy volume cleanly
//! when it can; only when nothing can be committed — the volume is
//! unavailable, or its flush fails — does it discard the retained set,
//! logging the deliberate data loss with its own event id.
//!
//! # Verified re-insert (`plans/DEVICES.md` D4c)
//!
//! An attach whose probed identity (`lib/fsprobe`) matches an unavailable
//! volume is a **re-insert** and is recovered in place rather than
//! re-attached as a duplicate. The journal carries a dual-acceptance
//! shadow of the volume's mutation-evidence window (the region any
//! foreign mutation must rewrite: the `ARXFS` superblock ring, the ext4
//! superblock, the FAT32 boot+`FSInfo` head — honestly weaker for weaker
//! formats), seeded at attach and maintained on every write. When the
//! re-read window proves non-mutation — every evidence block equals its
//! last-committed or latest shadow copy — the retained writes are
//! replayed, the device cache committed, and the volume returns to full
//! service under its original mount, name, and published root. Any doubt
//! (foreign mutation, a moved extent, abandoned retention, a replay or
//! flush failure) fails closed: the volume returns **read-only** in the
//! *recovery-conflict* state with the retained set still held for
//! explicit salvage or the audited force-discard — never a silent merge.
