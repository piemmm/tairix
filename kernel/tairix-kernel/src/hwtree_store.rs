//! Runtime hardware-inventory store (Design D, D1 — `plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! The single, authoritative record of the discovered hardware tree: one
//! growable node list the boot path seeds once, user-space bus drivers
//! publish discovered children into (`hw_emit_node`), and the autoload reader
//! snapshots — the one inventory every reader shares (no parallel device
//! lists).
//!
//! A node id names one device for the whole boot. The boot seed carries the
//! discovery ids; every node published later is issued an id above every id
//! the store has held, so no id is reissued and every node's id is above its
//! parent's. The list stays in ascending id order, which is what lets every
//! lookup by id binary-search it and a removal find a subtree in one pass.
//!
//! # Concurrency / boot-ordering
//!
//! Every access happens **after** the MMU is enabled: the boot path seeds
//! the store at the post-MMU init seam and the unlock kthread snapshots it
//! once the run queue is live. The [`SpinLock`]'s atomic read-modify-write is
//! UNPREDICTABLE on the MMU-off Device memory the boot CPU first runs on, so
//! callers must not touch the store before the MMU is on.
