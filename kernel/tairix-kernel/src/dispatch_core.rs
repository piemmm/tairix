//! The per-architecture modules differ only in two arch-specific facts:
//! the `SyscallDispatchFn` typedef the arch port's syscall trampoline
//! expects, and the bottom-typed halt the empty-slot branch jumps to.
//! Everything else — reading the kernel-stack `[u64; SYSCALL_MAX_ARGS]`

//! into the syscall-return register, and forwarding one syscall through

//! and lives here exactly once (no duplication).
//!
//! The module is host-testable and un-gated: the per-architecture
//! callbacks are thin wrappers that supply the arch `SyscallDispatchFn`
//! coercion and the halt, while the substantive logic is unit-tested
