//! Production syscall-dispatch callback for the riscv64 (QEMU `virt` /
//! SiFive) `tairix-kernel` binary — the riscv64 sibling of
//! [`crate::x86_64::dispatch`] (x86_64) and [`crate::aarch64::dispatch`]
//! (`plans/PI.md` RV-P2).
//!
//! The riscv64 `ecall` trap path shipped by
//! [`tairix_arch_riscv64::syscall_entry`] forwards each syscall to a
//! bare `extern "C"` callback of the
//! [`tairix_arch_riscv64::syscall_entry::SyscallDispatchFn`] type
//! (identical in shape to the x86_64 and aarch64 typedefs — one ABI). [`production_dispatch`] is that callback: it reads
//! the argument frame, forwards through the resident `DispatchHook`
//! published into [`DISPATCH_SLOT`] by `kernel_core::kernel_main`, and
//! encodes the result back into `a0`.
//!
//! The arch-neutral lookup → narrow → forward → encode logic lives in
//! [`crate::dispatch_core`] and is unit-tested there once; this module
//! supplies only the two riscv64-specific facts — the
//! `SyscallDispatchFn` coercion and the bottom-typed
//! [`tairix_arch_riscv64::halt_current_hart`] empty-slot halt.
