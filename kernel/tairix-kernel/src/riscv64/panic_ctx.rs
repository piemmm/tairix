//! riscv64 half of the fatal-report bridge: the port's four values plus
//! its two entry points ([`handle_panic_via_kernel_core`] for a `panic!`,
//! [`install_kernel_fault_handler`] for a fatal S-mode trap).
//!
//! # Why this lives in the bin's library half
//!
//! The architecture crate (`tairix_arch_riscv64`) may not depend on
//! `kernel/core` (the layering contract: an arch port names only the Arch
//! HAL and `lib/*`), so the bridge that turns a `#[panic_handler]` or a
//! trap-vector callback into a `kernel_core` report lives here, in the bin
//! crate that already links both. The shared policy is
//! [`crate::fatal_bridge`]; this module is only the riscv64 values.
//!
//! # How [`RiscvBinArch`] is reached
//!
//! The report needs a `&RiscvBinArch` (for `current_cpu` / `halt`). The
//! arch handle is built partway through boot, so `boot` publishes
//! `Arc::as_ptr(&arc)` into [`PANIC_ARCH_PTR`] before any code that could
//! panic runs. Before that publish the port's own report stands in (fail
//! closed, never a silent reset).
