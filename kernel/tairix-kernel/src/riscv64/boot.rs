//! Bare-metal boot pipeline for the riscv64 (QEMU `virt` / SiFive)
//! `tairix-kernel` binary — `plans/PI.md` RV-P1 / RV-P2.
//!
//! [`boot`] is the single entry point. The binary's
//! `extern "C" fn kernel_main(hartid, dtb)` (called from the arch
//! port's [`tairix_arch_riscv64::entry`] trampoline, `boot.s` →
//! `entry.rs`) forwards to it after `boot.s` has established the boot
//! stack and zeroed `.bss` on the boot hart. It performs the BSP
//! bring-up the paged boot slice needs and hands a validated
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::BootInfo`] to
//! [`tairix_kernel_core::kernel_main`]:
//!
//! 1. Enable the Sv39 identity MMU and install the S-mode trap vector
//!    ([`enable_mmu_and_vectors`]) so the `kernel_core` allocator /
//!    scheduler atomics run on Normal cacheable memory and a fault
//!    during bring-up is taken to a handler — the riscv64 analogue of
//!    the aarch64 P6c-2 step. Install the production `ecall` dispatch
//!    callback ([`crate::riscv64::dispatch::production_dispatch`]) before
//!    any user thread can run.
//! 2. Parse the flattened device tree (`a1`) for the first `/memory`
//!    node and the `/cpus` `timebase-frequency`.
//! 3. Build a [`tairix_kernel_mem::BootMemoryMap`] that reserves the
//!    firmware + kernel-image + boot-heap span `[ram_base,
//!    __kernel_end)` and marks `[__kernel_end, ram_end)` usable
//!    ([`build_boot_memory_map`]).
//! 4. Install the direct physical map over that RAM
//!    ([`tairix_arch_riscv64::paging::install_boot_physmap`]), before
//!    anything reaches a frame by pointer, and refuse a board whose
//!    kernel image ends above the process-root identity window.
//! 5. Construct the [`RiscvBinArch`] handle (boot hart + timebase) and
//!    assemble the `BootInfo`.
//!
//! RV-P2 runs the production path **paged**: the boot identity-maps
//! Sv39's whole canonical lower half with 1 GiB leaves, so every physical
//! address the board uses (the kernel image, the firmware DTB, the PLIC,
//! the `virt` MMIO window, and the carved DMA regions the
//! device-bring-up verticals read) keeps its address under translation,
//! and RAM is additionally reached above the user region through the
//! direct physical map (step 4). Enabling
//! asynchronous interrupts (the timer/PLIC) and dropping PID 1 into
//! user mode are staged follow-ups (`plans/PI.md` RV-P3), exactly as the
//! aarch64 port reached this point before P6c-3 wired user mode.
//!
//! # Why this lives in the bin crate, not the arch port
//!
//! The arch port (`kernel/arch/riscv64`) is a pure Arch HAL
//! implementation and names no concrete kernel subsystem. This pipeline names `kernel/{core,mem,sec}` and
//! `kernel/sched/api`, so it lives here — exactly as x86_64 keeps its
//! boot pipeline and `BinArch` wrapper, and aarch64 its `boot_aarch64`,
//! in this crate. [`RiscvBinArch`] is the local `KernelArch` wrapper
//! around the arch port's [`RiscvArch`] (orphan rules).
//!
//! The riscv64 QEMU verticals (`tests/integration/riscv64_boot` and the
//! virtio-MMIO / framebuffer bins it backs) consume this very pipeline
//! through that downstream crate — they publish the firmware map for
//! their device-bring-up observers and then delegate here, so there is
//! exactly one riscv64 boot orchestration.
//!
//! # No `unwrap` / `expect` / `panic!`
//!
//! Every fallible step returns a [`BootError`]; [`boot`] logs the stable
//! cause string and parks the hart via the arch port's
//! [`tairix_arch_riscv64::halt_current_hart`] (fail closed).
