//! The riscv64 (QEMU `virt` / SiFive) live root-unlock bring-up
//! (`plans/NETWORK.md` N4e-riscv64).
//!
//! The freestanding-riscv64 half of the in-kernel root-unlock service, the
//! cross-port sibling of [`crate::aarch64::root_unlock`]. It lives in the
//! architecture subtree because it names the riscv64 port directly (the PLIC
//! external-IRQ dispatch, the Sv39 paging primitives, the firmware device
//! tree); the device- and architecture-independent two-task tail — the
//! spawned interactive unlock and the persistent driver-store serve loop —
//! stays in the shared [`crate::unlock_orchestrate::finish_unlock`].
//!
//! It admits the in-kernel unlock kthread at the init seam, brings the
//! bootstrap virtio-blk root device up over the production PLIC device-IRQ
//! path ([`crate::riscv64::irq`]), and hands the opened disk to the shared
//! tail. The `virt` board's only floor block driver is virtio-blk (the
//! aarch64 EMMC2 SD path has no riscv64 analogue), so there is one bring-up.
