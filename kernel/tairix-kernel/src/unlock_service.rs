//! The in-kernel root-unlock service (`plans/PI.md` P11 Chunk B-2
//! INCREMENT (2)).
//!
//! Once the boot path has bound the bootstrap root block device
//! ([`crate::root_storage`]) and the console keyboard is live, the
//! encrypted root must be unlocked — the operator types the passphrase
//! ([`crate::root_mount::unlock_root_disk_interactively`]) — before
//! `login` can authenticate (the loaded database is published into
//! [`crate::root_mount::LATE_USERS_DB`]). A blocking console read before
//! the dispatch loop runs would deadlock, so the unlock runs as a
//! **scheduler kthread** admitted at the init seam, alongside PID 1.
//!
//! This module is the host-compiled, host-tested, device-independent core: the post-MMU boot stash ([`record_boot`] /
//! [`take_boot`]) carrying the resolved [`RootBlockBinding`], the firmware
//! DTB pointer, and the discovered hardware tree to the init seam, plus the
//! console-0 ownership gate ([`Console0Gate`] / [`CONSOLE0_GATE`] /
//! [`GatedConsoleRead`]) that keeps `login` from stealing the passphrase
//! bytes while the unlock is in progress.
//!
//! The freestanding, architecture-specific other half — the live block
//! bring-up that runs the unlock policy inside the kthread — lives beside
//! the rest of the aarch64 boot pipeline in `crate::aarch64::root_unlock`
//! (virtio-blk-MMIO for the QEMU `virt` path, and the Raspberry Pi 4 EMMC2
//! SD host for the Pi-metal root), so this arch-neutral core names no
//! architecture.
