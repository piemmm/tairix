//! The aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4) boot pipeline and `KernelArch` port
//! wrapper.
//!
//! Every module here names the aarch64 architecture port, so the whole
//! subtree is gated on the `kernel_isa = "aarch64"` build-script name (the
//! single selection point lives in `build.rs`, never an
//! inline `target_arch` predicate). The host-testable wrappers
//! ([`arch_wrapper`], [`dispatch`]) compile on an aarch64 host so their unit
//! tests run under `cargo test`; the bare-metal-only boot path, PID 1 spawn
//! seam, and runtime spawn producer are further gated on `freestanding`.

/// First non-addressable user virtual address on this port.

/// The aarch64 port configures `TCR_EL1.T0SZ = 25`, so the `TTBR0_EL1`
/// (user) translation regime covers a 39-bit virtual address range
/// `[0, 2^39)` = 512 GiB. `2^39` is therefore the first address a user
/// mapping can never reach, and the ceiling the dynamic heap and
/// file-mapping windows ([`crate::user_windows::user_windows`]) size
/// themselves below so they can
/// never run past addressable user space. Genuinely target-specific — the
/// `T0SZ` the port programs dictates it — so it lives beside the port, not
/// in the architecture-neutral layout module.

/// Those two are what let the kernel reach the whole of RAM without
/// carrying it where a user program can address it: the map used to be an
/// identity window in `TTBR0_EL1`, so it had to stop at the image bias and
/// a machine with more RAM than that had frames the kernel could not reach.
/// Here `TTBR1_EL1` holds it and the architecture keeps the two regimes
/// apart, so the first assertion is a statement about the `TCR_EL1` sizes
/// the port programs rather than about a slot convention. Pinned at build
/// time rather than discovered as a fail-closed allocation on a large
