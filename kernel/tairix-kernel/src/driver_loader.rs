//! In-kernel signed-driver-load gate (`plans/PI.md` P10 5c-ii; PLAN Stage
//! 4.HW item 5).
//!
//! The [`driver_catalog`](crate::driver_catalog) registry decides *which*
//! driver binds a discovered hardware node. This module
//! is the load *mechanism*: it admits a registered in-kernel driver through
//! the signed-manifest `drvhost::Host::load` gate — Ed25519 signature
//! verification against the build's embedded driver-signing key, the
//! `CAP_DRV_LOAD` hard gate, and the `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` gate that every
//! `kind = InKernel` manifest additionally demands —
//! rather than calling a driver's `register()` directly. Every capability
//! and input check stays kernel-side and the load fails closed. The gate is generic over hardware: it admits any driver in the
//! [`IN_KERNEL_DRIVERS`](crate::driver_catalog::IN_KERNEL_DRIVERS) registry,
//! never a hard-coded device list.
//!
//! # In-kernel, statically-linked drivers
//!
//! keeps drivers in user space wherever feasible and
//! sanctions the drivers that must run in-kernel (`kind = InKernel`). Those
//! drivers are linked into the kernel image and brought up through this
//! gate: the spawner is an in-process register that invokes the verified
//! driver's own `register()` entry point (an admission check returning a
//! marker handle) on the granted-capability host view the gate built. The
//! signed image carries no program payload — there is no separate binary to
//! spawn — but it carries the driver's real signed manifest (kind,
//! capability request, and the driver crate's own bind table), so the
//! *trust decision* is identical to the user-space load path. For the
//! remaining in-kernel floor — the bootstrap storage drivers — the real
//! register-window mapping and DMA carve run afterwards over the consuming
//! service's own capability-gated host (`crate::aarch64::root_unlock`), not
//! this admission view.
//!
//! The baked, signed manifest images and the build's driver-signing public
//! key are produced by `build.rs` (`emit_signed_driver_manifests`) and
//! owned by the [`driver_catalog`](crate::driver_catalog) registry.
