//! The whole-disk block-level LRU cache (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` SMART11).
//!
//! [`BlockCache`] wraps the one brought-up boot disk *below* the
//! block-sharing layer (`crate::shared_block::SharedBlock`), so every
//! window onto the disk — the read-only `/System` driver-store window,
//! the encrypted-root unlock window, and the writable-root window —
//! reads through one coherent cache of recently used device blocks.
//! It complements the higher layers rather than duplicating them:
//! `kernel/core::fs::CachedFs` retains *served plaintext* per volume
//! and the SMART3 `TransformClusterCache` retains *decompressed
//! cluster plaintext*; this cache retains the raw device blocks
//! underneath both, so their misses — and every uncached consumer of
//! the disk (partition-table walks, driver-store scans, `ARXFS`
//! metadata block reads) — avoid a device round-trip that otherwise
//! parks the calling task across a completion interrupt.
//!
//! # Classification, budget, pressure
//!
//! At construction the cache declares its [`CacheCandidate`] — class
//! [`ReclaimClass::CleanFileData`] (clean, rebuildable bytes
//! re-readable from the device by one bounded read), owned by the
//! kernel block-device subsystem, cheap to rebuild, treated as user
//! data (the disk carries the encrypted user volume), precisely
//! invalidated by the device's single serialised writer, droppable on
//! demand — and classifies it through the `kernel/mem::reclaim`
//! admission gate. A refusal poisons the cache from birth: every
//! operation passes straight through to the device (fail closed,
//! never an unclassified cache).
//!
//! The cache is bounded by a [`CacheBudget`] and accounted in a
//! [`CacheAccounting`] ledger. Every operation first applies the
//! current pressure band's forced-shrink target for the clean-file
//! class ([`shrink_target`]): shrunk to the low watermark at mild
//! pressure and drained to zero from moderate on, before anonymous
//! pages are handed to `ramzip` (`plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` section 6).
//! Growth is admitted only at normal pressure and never into the
//! reserve ([`tairix_reclaim::PressureGauge::growth_permitted`]). Inserts
//! over the
//! hard limit first evict least-recently-used blocks down to the low
//! watermark (hysteresis).
//!
//! # Coherence and secret hygiene
//!
//! The cache sits on the device side of the `SharedBlock` sleep lock,
//! so it observes **every** operation any window issues, serialised:
//! a write updates the cached copies of the written blocks in place, a
//! discard invalidates its range, and a failed write invalidates the
//! range (the device state is unknown — fail closed). Reads and
//! writes issued under [`BufferClass::Sensitive`] carry material the
//! caller will scrub (key slots, credentials): they bypass the cache
//! entirely *and* evict any cached copy of their range, so no
//! credential-bearing block is ever retained. Every cached buffer is
//! volatilely wiped before its entry is released — on invalidation,
//! eviction, pressure shrink, poisoning, and teardown — because the
//! disk carries the encrypted user volume and cached ciphertext is
//! still treated as user data.
//!
//! # Bypasses
//!
//! Request *size* is not an admission rule: a filesystem that
//! coalesces its reads into whole contiguous runs is exactly the
//! caller whose repeats must be served from RAM, so a wide read is
//! retained like any other. Only a request the cache could not hold
//! without evicting itself — one wider than the budget's low watermark
//! (a single block always fits) — streams through uncached, a bound
//! that scales with the machine rather than a hand-picked length.
//! Unaligned or zero-length requests are the device's own error
//! surface and are forwarded untouched.
