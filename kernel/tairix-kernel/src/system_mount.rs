//! Boot-time install of the userland `fs_*` filesystem mount table
//! (`PREREQUISITES.md` P-A).
//!
//! The `fs_*` syscalls route through a single
//! [`MountedFilesystemService`] the dispatch hook holds from boot (installed
//! via `BootInfo::with_filesystem`).
//! That service serves operations against a late-installed [`LateFilesystem`]
//! mount and resolves caller groups through a late-installed
//! [`LateIdentity`](tairix_kernel_core::LateIdentity) table; until the boot
//! path installs both, every `fs_*` syscall fails closed
//! ([`Errno::NotImplemented`](tairix_abi::Errno::NotImplemented)).
//!
//! # The mount layering: writable root, read-only `/System` shadow
//!
//! The system has two `ARXFS` volumes on the one bootstrap-floor disk:
//!
//! * the **encrypted, writable root volume** (`ARXFSRoot`) — the persistent
//!   home of every writable path: `/` itself, `/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage`,
//!   and the two writable `/System` exceptions `/System/Logs` and
//!   `/System/Settings`; and
//! * the **read-only, well-known-keyed `/System` volume** (`ARXFSSystem`) —
//!   the immutable kernel image, drivers, and libraries.
//!
//! The writable volume is mounted as `/` (`MountTable::back_root`); the
//! read-only `/System` volume is mounted *over* it at `/System`, and the
//! writable `/System` exceptions are carved back out as rebased sub-mounts of
//! the writable volume. `MountTable` longest-prefix resolution stitches the
//! two into one tree with **no path served by both volumes** — a read of
//! `/System/Drivers/...` resolves to the read-only volume, a write under
//! `/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage`, `/System/Logs`, or `/System/Settings`
//! resolves to the writable volume, and everything else resolves to `/` on
//! the writable volume. This is disjoint sub-mounting, never a union/overlay
//! "merge" of two `/System` trees (which would need whiteouts, copy-up, and
//! ambiguous write targets — the opposite of the charter's fail-closed,
//! deterministic resolution).
//!
//! This module owns the mount half: it opens an independent `'static`
//! read-only window onto the `/System` volume (the driver-store serve loop
//! keeps its own window over the same
//! [`SharedBlock`](crate::shared_block::SharedBlock), and concurrent windows
//! are already park-safe through the device's `SleepLock`), publishes the
//! mount-table layout into [`LATE_FILESYSTEM`], and registers the read-only
//! `/System` driver against it. The writable root driver is registered
//! separately by [`register_writable_state`] once the encrypted root is
//! unlocked; the identity half is published by the encrypted-root unlock step
//! (`crate::root_mount`, [`LATE_IDENTITY`]).
//!
//! # Why the driver type is erased
//!
//! The bootstrap-floor disk type `B` (virtio-blk on the QEMU `virt` / x86_64
//! root, EMMC2 on the Raspberry Pi 4) is dynamic in one binary, so the
//! concrete `ARXFS<PartitionBlock<BorrowedBlockWindow<'static, B>>>` differs
//! per board. The boot-time [`LateFilesystem`] / [`MountedFilesystemService`]
//! statics must be a *single* concrete type, so the mounted driver is erased
//! behind [`KernelFs`] (a `Box<dyn KernelFs>`); the forwarding impls below
//! let the boxed driver satisfy the read/write/security/stats-plus-`Send`
//! bound the service requires.
//!
//! Until the writable root driver is registered (after the encrypted root is
//! unlocked), every operation on `/` and its writable subtrees fails closed
//! `NotImplemented`, never a silent fallback to the read-only `/System`. The
//! read-only `/System` volume itself never accepts a write through its
//! handle.

/// it (`/Users`, `/Apps`, `/Storage`, `/System/Logs`, `/System/Settings`),
/// which all share the one `ROOT_VOLUME_HANDLE`.
///
/// Called once by the encrypted-root unlock path after the root volume is
/// unlocked, with a read-write [`KernelFs`] over that volume (a second,
/// independent `'static` window, park-safe through the device `SleepLock`,
/// distinct from the unlock task's own read window). Until this lands, every
/// write/read under `/` and its writable subtrees fails closed
/// `NotImplemented` — never a silent fallback to the read-only `/System`.
///
/// Fail-soft and audited: a refusal (the writable volume was already
/// registered, a logic error since this runs once) leaves the writable tree
/// failing closed and never aborts the boot. The VFS itself is published by
/// [`install_system_mount`]; this only attaches the driver, so it is safe to
/// call after that step regardless of ordering.
///
/// Returns the registered driver's shared lock so the caller can share
/// the volume's **single** writer with the account-administration engine
/// (`RootAdminBacking`) — never a second independent window over the same
/// device — or `None` when registration was refused.
