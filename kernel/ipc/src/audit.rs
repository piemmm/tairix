//! | ID   | Level | Name                          | When |
//! |-----:|-------|-------------------------------|------|
//! | 3000 | Info  | `PORT_CREATED`                | A capability-checked port was created. |
//! | 3001 | Error | `PORT_CREATE_DENIED`          | A port-creation request was refused (creator lacks bind authority). |
//! | 3002 | Info  | `PORT_DESTROYED`              | A port was destroyed (any subsequent send fails closed). `drained` counts the messages discarded with it, `refused` the sends refused over its life because its owner admitted another sender. |
//! | 3003 | Info  | `PORT_REGISTERED`             | A port was bound into the named-port registry under its `EndpointId`. |
//! | 3004 | Error | `PORT_REGISTER_DENIED`        | A registration was refused because the `EndpointId` was already bound. |
//! | 3005 | Info  | `PORT_UNREGISTERED`           | A port was removed from the registry and destroyed. |
//! | 3006 | Info  | `PORT_NAME_PUBLISHED`         | A well-known name was bound to an endpoint in the registry. |
//! | 3007 | Error | `PORT_NAME_PUBLISH_DENIED`    | A name binding was refused (name already bound, or its endpoint is not registered). |
//! | 3008 | Info  | `PORT_NAME_WITHDRAWN`         | A well-known name binding was removed (explicitly, or because its endpoint was unregistered). |
//! | 3009 | Info  | `PORT_SENDER_ADMITTED`        | A port's owner admitted the one sender its port takes; `discarded` counts the queued messages of other senders dropped with it. |
//! | 3010 | Debug | `MESSAGE_DELIVERED`           | A message was enqueued for delivery. Recorded at `Debug` for the same reason as `CALL_POSTED` (3043): routine high-throughput transport. |
//! | 3011 | Error | `MESSAGE_SEND_DENIED`         | A send was refused. `reason` discriminates: `missing_capability` (the sender lacks the port's required capabilities) or `not_admitted` (the port's owner admitted another sender — recorded once per admission, the rest counted into `PORT_DESTROYED`, so a sender the port will never take cannot flood the trail). |
//! | 3012 | Error | `MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE`           | A send was refused because the payload exceeded the port's `max_payload`. |
//! | 3013 | Error | `MESSAGE_SEND_TO_CLOSED_PORT` | A send raced with destruction and lost. |
//! | 3014 | Debug | `MAILBOX_FULL`                | A send was refused because the receiver's mailbox was full. Recorded at `Debug`: a busy receiver is a routine resource condition on a normal high-rate path, not an authorisation decision, so recording one per refused send would flood the log; forensics recovers it by lowering the level. |
//! | 3020 | Info  | `SHMEM_CREATED`               | A shared-memory object was created. |
//! | 3021 | Info  | `SHMEM_MAPPED`                | A mapping into a recipient was established. |
//! | 3022 | Error | `SHMEM_MAP_DENIED`            | A mapping request was refused. |
//! | 3023 | Info  | `SHMEM_REVOKED`               | A shared-memory object was revoked; all live mappings invalidated. |
//! | 3030 | Info  | `NOTIFY_BOUND`                | A receiver bound to a notification channel. |
//! | 3031 | Info  | `NOTIFY_SIGNALLED`            | A notification was delivered. |
//! | 3032 | Error | `NOTIFY_SIGNAL_DENIED`        | A signal was refused (sender lacks the channel's signal capabilities). |
//! | 3040 | Info  | `CALL_ENDPOINT_CREATED`       | A capability-checked synchronous call endpoint was created. |
//! | 3041 | Error | `CALL_ENDPOINT_CREATE_DENIED` | A call-endpoint creation request was refused (creator lacks bind authority). |
//! | 3042 | Info  | `CALL_ENDPOINT_DESTROYED`     | A call endpoint was destroyed (in-flight callers fail closed). |
//! | 3043 | Debug | `CALL_POSTED`                 | A request was posted to a call endpoint, awaiting a reply. Recorded at `Debug`: the synchronous call path is the high-throughput RPC transport (e.g. the USB URB endpoint), so a successful post is routine and would otherwise flood the log two records per round-trip. Its authorisation/size denials (3044, 3045) stay at `Error`; the queue-full resource condition (3047) is `Debug` for the same reason as the post itself. |
//! | 3044 | Error | `CALL_POST_DENIED`            | A request was refused for lack of the endpoint's required capabilities. |
//! | 3045 | Error | `CALL_REQUEST_TOO_LARGE`      | A request was refused because its payload exceeded `max_request`. |
//! | 3046 | Error | `CALL_POST_TO_CLOSED_ENDPOINT`| A post raced with destruction and lost. |
//! | 3047 | Debug | `CALL_QUEUE_FULL`             | A post was refused because the endpoint's outstanding-call queue was full. `Debug` for the same reason as `MAILBOX_FULL` (3014): a busy server is a routine resource condition, not an authorisation decision. |
//! | 3048 | Debug | `CALL_REPLIED`                | A server delivered a reply to an in-flight call. Recorded at `Debug` for the same reason as `CALL_POSTED` (3043): routine high-throughput RPC completion. Its denial (3049) stays at `Error`. |
//! | 3049 | Error | `CALL_REPLY_DENIED`           | A reply was refused. The `reason` field discriminates: `oversize_reply` (the server exceeded `max_reply`) or `unknown_ticket` (no such in-flight call — it timed out, was cancelled, or the ticket is forged). |
//! | 3053 | Warn  | `CALL_TIMED_OUT`              | An in-flight call's deadline elapsed before the server replied; the ticket is retired and a late reply is refused. Recorded because the caller's own failure may be handled silently — for an in-kernel caller (the filesystem's block path) this is the only trace that a device missed its budget. |
//! | 3050 | Error | `CALL_ENDPOINT_REGISTER_DENIED` | A registry bind was refused because the `EndpointId` was already bound (the created endpoint is dropped; mirrors `PORT_REGISTER_DENIED`, 3004). |
//! | 3051 | Info  | `CALL_POSTER_VANISHED`        | A caller task exited with calls still in flight on this endpoint; the kernel cancelled them (queued requests dropped before service, in-service tickets retired so the server's reply fails closed, unclaimed replies discarded). |
//! | 3052 | Info  | `CALL_ENDPOINT_GRANTS_REVOKED` | A destroyed endpoint's delegated per-endpoint grants were revoked. |
//! | 3060 | Error | `PAYLOAD_ALLOC_FAILED`        | The kernel heap could not hold the wiped-on-drop copy of a port send, call post, or reply, so the transfer failed closed. |
