//! Capability-checked typed message ports.
//!
//! A [`Port`] is a kernel-owned endpoint identified by a stable
//! [`EndpointId`] declared via `lib/abi`. Each port carries:
//!
//! * `required_send_caps` — the [`CapabilitySet`] a sender's task must
//!   hold for a send to succeed. The kernel enforces this on every
//!   call; the receiver does **not** re-check (final
//!   bullet).
//! * `required_recv_caps` — the set the creator (and any later binder
//!   in 2.7's syscall layer) must hold *at port creation*.
//! * `max_payload` — the maximum payload length, bounded above by
//!   [`tairix_abi::ipc::IPC_MESSAGE_MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN`].
//! * a bounded mailbox; out-of-room sends fail with
//!   [`Errno::WouldBlock`] and an audit record — a full mailbox is
//!   transient back-pressure the sender may retry, not a malformed
//!   request.
//!
//! Every refused operation emits exactly one audit event through
//! [`crate::audit`] before returning the [`Errno`] to the caller
//! ("fail-closed"). Ports use a lock-free atomic state word so the
//! send fast path can reject delivery to a closed port without
//! taking the mailbox lock; see [`tests/loom.rs`](../../tests/loom.rs)
//! for the model-checked interleavings.
