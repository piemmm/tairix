//!
//! `kernel/core` is the *only* kernel crate (besides `kernel/sched/*`)
//! permitted to name a concrete scheduler policy. It selects exactly one
//! implementation at build time via a `scheduler-*` Cargo feature and
//! re-exports it as [`Scheduler`]; the rest of `kernel/core` — and every
//! other kernel crate — works in terms of this alias and the
//! [`tairix_kernel_sched_api`] contract, never a concrete policy crate.
//!
//! Adding a policy means adding a sibling `kernel/sched/<impl>` crate and
//! a `scheduler-<impl>` feature here; the `compile_error!` guards below
//! enforce that exactly one is active per image.

// Re-export the policy-neutral vocabulary so the rest of `kernel/core`
// names one canonical definition.
