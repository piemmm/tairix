//! The kernel wait-set registry: caller-owned objects that multiplex the
//! readiness of several heterogeneous event sources (`plans/USB.md` — the
//! asynchronous host-controller event loop).
//!
//! A wait-set is the scalable analogue of `epoll`/`kqueue`. A service that
//! must react to many event streams in one process — for the USB host
//! controller, incoming URB-submit IPC calls on the per-interface endpoints it
//! serves *and* its controller's completion interrupt — registers each source
//! once and then blocks on the set, instead of busy-polling (the charter
//! forbids spinning a core) or re-supplying a per-wait array (which would cap
//! the number of sources at a fixed ceiling). Membership lives in a growable
//! [`Vec`], so a busy controller with many interfaces is bounded only by
//! memory, not by a hand-picked constant.
//!
//! # What lives here, and what does not
//!
//! This module is *pure registry mechanics*, like [`crate::callreg`]: it owns
//! the map from a minted handle to a set's `{owner, members}` and enforces
//! that only the set's owner may read or mutate it. It deliberately does **not**
//! resolve a member's underlying resource (an IPC endpoint, an IRQ line) or
//! test its readiness — that needs the call-endpoint registry and the IRQ
//! table, which the syscall handler in [`crate::syscalls`] holds. The handler
//! owner-checks the *resource* before adding a member and re-checks it while
//! scanning for readiness; this registry only owner-checks the *set*.
//!
//! # Why a global
//!
//! Like [`crate::callreg`] and [`crate::waitq`], the registry is global pure
//! data behind a [`SpinLock`] (never a `static mut`, so not the global mutable
//! static the charter forbids): the wait-set is created, modified, and waited
//! on from the syscall handler, and torn down from the task-exit / driver-
//! unload path, none of which own the others. A global keyed by the minted
//! handle is the natural rendezvous and avoids threading another map through
//! `KernelState`'s cross-crate wiring.
