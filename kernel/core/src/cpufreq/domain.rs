//! The bound mechanism and the target published to it.
//!
//! Exactly one frequency mechanism serves a machine, so this holds one
//! binding: the process that took the role, the handle it was issued, the
//! [`CpuFreqLimits`] it declared, and the target currently published to it.
//! A second bind is refused rather than arbitrated — two drivers taking turns
//! on one clock would be worse than neither.
//!
//! # What is on the hot path and what is not
//!
//! The dispatch loop's work brackets run thousands of times a second on every
//! CPU, so they take no lock and do no survey. Each one folds *its own* CPU's
//! utilisation through per-CPU atomics, and asks nothing for it: work arriving
//! grants no rate here, only [`attention`], which flags a task wake at most
//! once per [`ACTIVE_REVIEW_NS`] however often the machine goes quiet.
//!
//! Deciding the rate needs every CPU's utilisation, which is O(number of
//! CPUs) — so it happens in the waiter, under the binding lock. Holding the
//! lock across that [`survey`] is what makes the sequence and the rate
//! advance together, with no pair a reader can catch half-updated and no
//! second copy of either. Nothing an interrupt handler runs touches this
//! lock.
//!
//! # Bounded without a caller pacing it
//!
//! [`wait`] parks with a deadline of its own choosing: the active cadence
//! while work is running, a window while the rate is above the floor and
//! decaying, and none once it has settled at the floor with nothing running.
//! So a busy machine's rate climbs as its filters fill, a quiescing one walks
//! back down a step per window, and a quiet one sleeps until real work
//! arrives — and the driver needs neither a timeout argument nor a poll.
