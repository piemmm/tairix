//! The kernel-side process-signal seam the `signal` (`abi-v1` number 64)
//! syscall uses (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP7).
//!
//! [`ProcessSignal`] is the one object-safe boundary between the
//! arch-neutral syscall handler in `kernel/core` and the scheduler-side
//! producer that delivers a control signal. It carries the two halves
//! separately — resolving a pid against the sender's own children, and
//! delivering to an already-authorised target — because who may signal whom
//! is decided by the syscall handler alone (own child, else the target's own
//! principal, else `CAP_PROC_CONTROL`, `plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T11). Like the
//! [`ProcessWait`], [`ArchImageBuilder`](crate::spawn::ArchImageBuilder), and
//! [`MemMap`](crate::memmap::MemMap) seams, the concrete producer is
//! installed at boot through the `with_process_signal` builder and the
//! handler reaches it through this trait.
//!
//! Until a producer is installed the handler holds [`NULL_PROCESS_SIGNAL`],
//! which fails closed: both halves return [`Errno::NotImplemented`], never
//! pretending a signal was delivered — exactly as
//! [`NULL_PROCESS_WAIT`](crate::procwait::NULL_PROCESS_WAIT) does for
//! `wait`. The scheduler-side producer that actually delivers the signal is
//! [`KernelProcessSignal`] (`plans/SPAWN.md` `SP7b`), installed at boot in
//! place of the fail-closed floor.
