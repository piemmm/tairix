//! Per-**process** address-space registry (increment **B** of the staged
//! user-memory copy path, `PLAN.md` Stage 7).
//!
//! The kernel's `copy_from_user` / `copy_to_user` boundary
//! ([`tairix_kernel_mem::uaccess`] /
//! `tests/SECURITY.md` §5) walks the *calling process's* address space.
//! A syscall handler therefore needs to turn the caller's
//! [`tairix_kernel_sec::ProcessId`] into the pair the copy path consumes:
//! the process's user [`AddressSpace`](tairix_kernel_mem::AddressSpace)
//! and the kernel [`PhysMap`] that backs it. This module owns that
//! mapping.
//!
//! # Two scopes, two key types
//!
//! Almost everything here is **process**-scoped — the address space itself,
//! the standard streams, resource limits, device grants, open files, the
//! working directory, the file and anonymous region records, the pinning mark,
//! and the mapped-byte accounting. Every thread of a process shares all of it,
//! so those maps are keyed by [`ProcessId`] and a thread's syscall resolves
//! its process's entry.
//!
//! The exception is the user-stack span: each thread has a stack of its own,
//! so [`AddressSpaceRegistry::stack_span`] is keyed by [`TaskId`] and the
//! per-process committed total is maintained alongside it. The two key types
//! are distinct precisely so a site cannot silently scope one to the other —
//! keying process state by a thread id does not compile.
//!
//! # Why trait objects
//!
//! [`tairix_kernel_mem::AddressSpace`] is generic over its
//! [`PageTable`](tairix_kernel_mem::PageTable) backend, so the
//! kernel cannot hold a `BTreeMap<ProcessId, AddressSpace<P>>` for a
//! single `P` — different tasks may run on different architecture page
//! tables, and the orchestrator that composes this registry into
//! `KernelState` is architecture-neutral. Each entry is therefore
//! stored behind the object-safe
//! [`UserAddressSpace`] (the read-only translate view the copy walk
//! needs) and a boxed [`PhysMap`]. The same erasure the kernel
//! already applies to the
//! direct map (`&dyn PhysMap`) is applied to the address space, so the
//! registry stays one concrete, non-generic type.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! An entry is [`register`](AddressSpaceRegistry::register)ed when a
//! task's `rxe` image is mapped (the loader's
//! [`map_image`](tairix_kernel_mem::map_image) result handed to the
//! spawner) and [`withdraw`](AddressSpaceRegistry::withdraw)n when the
//! task exits. Both are fail-closed: registering an id that is already
//! present is refused rather than silently
//! replacing a live mapping, and resolving an unknown id yields
//! `None`. The registry is a pure data structure with no ambient
//! authority and no audit sink of its own — the call sites that drive
//! the lifecycle (the spawner, the `exit` handler) own the
//! security-relevant logging, exactly as the dispatcher audits IPC
//! endpoint lookups rather than [`PortRegistry`] doing so internally.
//!
//! [`PortRegistry`]: tairix_kernel_ipc::PortRegistry
