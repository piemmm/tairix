//! A scheduler-blocking mutual-exclusion lock (a *sleeping* mutex).
//!
//! Every lock in `lib/sync` ([`SpinLock`](tairix_sync::SpinLock),
//! [`RwLock`](tairix_sync::RwLock), [`McsLock`](tairix_sync::McsLock), …)
//! *spins* on contention. That is correct only for a short critical section
//! whose holder never gives up the CPU. A `SleepLock` is the opposite: its
//! critical section may **park** — most importantly it may be held across a
//! block-device completion-IRQ wait (`Block::read_blocks` parks the calling
//! task on the controller interrupt). A spin lock held across such a park is
//! a defect: a second contender on the same CPU deadlocks, and on another CPU
//! it busy-spins on a holder that is asleep (forbidden busy-waiting). A
//! `SleepLock` instead **parks the contender off the run queue** and wakes it
//! when the holder releases — no spinning while a holder sleeps.
//!
//! This is the per-mount serialisation primitive the userland filesystem
//! path needs: each `fs_*` operation runs in the calling task's own context
//! and takes the mount's `SleepLock` for the duration of one operation
//! (including the device park), so operations on *different* mounts proceed
//! fully in parallel while operations on one mount are serialised without a
//! single global server task.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `kernel/core`, not `lib/sync`
//!
//! Parking and waking a task is the scheduler's job, and the layering forbids
//! a `lib/*` crate from depending on the kernel. So, unlike the spinning
//! primitives, a sleeping lock cannot live in `lib/sync`: it reaches the
//! scheduler through the installed [`WaitQueueArch`](crate::WaitQueueArch)
//! hook (for the current CPU, the current task, and `unpark`) and the
//! kernel's `reschedule_current` park primitive (to park the caller),
//! exactly as the console-read and process-wait blocking backings do.
//!
//! # No lost wake-ups
//!
//! The acquire path closes the release/park race with the same discipline
//! the other kernel waiters use: the contender **registers on the wait queue
//! before it re-tests** the lock, so a release in the window between its
//! failed fast-path attempt and its park cannot be missed — the releaser's
//! wake finds the registered task, and the scheduler's wake-pending token
//! turns an `unpark` that races a not-yet-committed park into a re-ready
//! rather than a lost wake-up. Each woken contender re-tests and either
//! acquires or parks again, so a wake meant for another contender is a
//! harmless spurious wake.
//!
//! # Fairness
//!
//! Waiters retain FIFO registration order. Release hands ownership directly
//! to the oldest task while keeping the lock closed to fresh contenders, then
//! wakes only that task. This avoids both a thundering herd and barging: a
//! long-waiting disk operation cannot be perpetually displaced by newer work.
//!
//! # The uncontended path is two atomics
//!
//! Acquire and release are one compare-exchange each when nobody is waiting,
//! and the wait queue is not touched at all. That matters because this lock
//! serialises *every* block-device operation on a shared disk
//! (`crate::shared_block`), so a filesystem read walking a file pays one
//! acquire/release per device operation — and a device operation served from
//! the block cache above the disk is a memcpy, not a park.
//!
//! What makes it possible is that contention lives **in the lock word**: a
//! contender sets a `CONTENDED` bit there before it parks, so the releaser's
//! single `LOCKED -> 0` compare-exchange fails precisely when a wake is
//! owed. Flag and lock bit share one location, so their modification order is
//! total and no store/load fence is needed: a contender that publishes before
//! the release makes that release take the wake path, and one that publishes
//! after it observes the lock already free and never parks. Keeping the
//! "is anyone waiting?" answer in a separate structure would have needed the
//! wait-queue lock (and a `BTreeMap` lookup) on every release to learn that
//! nobody was.
//!
//! That holds for the fast path, which is itself a read-modify-write of the
//! word and so cannot miss a bit set before it. It does **not** extend to the
//! slow path's "the queue was empty, so drop the word" tail: a contender
//! registering after that scan set `CONTENDED` in the word the release then
//! wiped, having already read `LOCKED` as set and committed to park, and no
//! later release consulted the queue again — a silent boot hang. The slow
//! path therefore releases *before* it decides nobody is waiting, and reads
//! the queue once more afterwards (`release_and_recheck`).
