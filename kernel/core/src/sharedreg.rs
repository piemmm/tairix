//! The kernel cross-process shared-memory region registry (`plans/USB.md`).
//!
//! A shared-memory region is a block of kernel-owned RAM two cooperating
//! processes map to exchange bulk data without a kernel copy (the USB
//! request-block data buffer). This registry owns the *policy* over those
//! regions: the kernel-allocated unforgeable region id, the backing block
//! set (each block's physical base and buddy order — one block for a small
//! region, several mapped into one contiguous window for a large one), the
//! reference count across the owner and
//! every grantee mapping, and the per-task list of live mappings used to
//! release the right region on `shm_unmap` and to reclaim a task's mappings
//! on exit or driver-unload teardown.
//!
//! The *mechanism* (allocate + zero + map + free frames) lives behind the
//! [`SharedMemFacility`] the caller passes in — the syscall handler hands its
//! own boot-installed producer, and the driver-unload teardown hands the same
//! one threaded through the spawn context — so the registry holds no global
//! producer of its own. Scrubbing through the kernel direct map (the facility's
//! job) lets the reclaim path free a region's frames even from a task whose
//! teardown is driven by the device manager rather than the region's owner.
//!
//! Like [`crate::callreg`] the region/mapping bookkeeping is global pure data
//! behind a [`SpinLock`] (never a `static mut`), because the syscall handlers
//! and the exit / driver-unload reclaim paths reach it from different call
//! sites and neither owns the other. Every operation fails closed.
