//! Per-CPU pending-preemption latch: the bridge between a timer tick the
//! kernel could not act on immediately and the next point it safely can.
//!
//! The kernel is non-preemptible: a one-shot preemption tick taken while
//! the CPU is in kernel mode (mid-syscall, or in a kernel kthread) must
//! never context-switch away from a half-completed kernel critical
//! section, so the ports' IRQ paths preempt only a tick taken from user
//! mode. Before this latch existed, a quantum that expired *inside* a
//! syscall was silently lost — the fired one-shot was disarmed, nothing
//! recorded that the running task's turn was over, and the task returned
//! to user mode with no timer armed, free to run unpreempted until its
//! next voluntary yield. A task that regularly sat in syscalls (a shell
//! tool walking the filesystem, a process writing the console) could
//! therefore starve every competitor: cooperative scheduling in
//! preemptive clothing.
//!
//! The latch closes that hole with three sites, all on this CPU:
//!
//! * **Set** — the per-tick callback every port's timer IRQ path invokes
//!   on every fired one-shot calls [`note_preempt_tick`]. Latching is
//!   pure accounting (one atomic store), so it is safe on a tick taken
//!   in kernel mode.
//! * **Consume** — when a syscall completes, the production dispatch
//!   hook calls [`take_preempt_pending`]; a latched tick converts the
//!   syscall's ordinary return into the same suspend-back-to-scheduler
//!   path a `yield` syscall takes, so the expired turn is honoured at
//!   the first safe boundary. The running task can now overrun its
//!   quantum by at most the remainder of one bounded syscall, never
//!   indefinitely.
//! * **Clear** — the dispatcher calls `clear_preempt_pending`
//!   immediately before switching a task in: the scheduler has just made
//!   a fresh decision (and re-armed the one-shot for a contended CPU),
//!   which supersedes any tick latched before the switch. This is what
//!   keeps a user-mode tick — which already preempts immediately through
//!   the ports' user-mode preempt point — from also triggering a
//!   spurious yield on the resumed task's next syscall.
//!
//! A tick is latched whether the one-shot fired for a preemption quantum
//! or for a blocking-wait wakeup: both mean the scheduler may have newly
//! runnable work, and the user-mode path already yields on either (the
//! ports preempt on every user-taken timer tick). The next dispatch
//! re-evaluates and re-arms, so an unnecessary yield costs one bounded
//! scheduler round-trip and is never wrong; a *missed* expiry is the
//! starvation defect this module exists to prevent.
//!
//! # The forced-yield latch (a monopolising lone user task)
//!
//! The tick latch above is competitor-gated: a *lone* runnable user task
//! with no competitor and nothing pending is deliberately left running,
//! because rescheduling to the same sole task only churns the
//! address-space/TLB switch. That is correct for scheduling, but it means
//! a CPU-bound user task that never issues a syscall never returns to the
//! dispatch loop at all: its per-dispatch housekeeping (the deferred-wake
//! and console-transmit drains) and its progress/liveness heartbeats stop,
//! and the task withholds the CPU indefinitely — the monopolisation the
//! charter forbids.
//!
//! A second, *un-gated* latch closes that hole. The lockup watchdog calls
//! [`request_forced_yield`] when it observes an `Active` CPU whose
//! scheduler progress has been stale past a monopoly guard, from both of
//! the per-CPU interrupts that may still be running there: its
//! non-maskable cadence sample and its maskable preemption tick. Either
//! preemption point then honours it by suspending the task back to the
//! dispatcher unconditionally (no competitor required), so the dispatch
//! loop runs one iteration — stamping progress, draining housekeeping —
//! before re-dispatching the task. It arms no new periodic timer: it rides
//! an interrupt already firing on that CPU, so the tickless invariant is
//! untouched.
//!
//! Two request paths are not redundancy for its own sake. The cadence is
//! the only channel that survives a CPU that has stopped taking maskable
//! interrupts; the tick is the only one that survives a CPU whose cadence
//! has died — and a dead cadence also kills the guard that rides it, so
//! without the tick path a core in exactly that state monopolises itself
//! unopposed.
//!
//! A **delivered reschedule IPI** takes the same un-gated latch
//! ([`crate::traps::on_reschedule_ipi`]), because it is not a quantum
//! expiring but a decision another CPU has already taken about this one:
//! work placed on its queue, or the task running on it told to die or to
//! give up its slot. Judging it against "has this CPU a competitor" dropped
//! precisely the case its senders send it for — a lone CPU-bound victim,
//! whose death then waited on the monopoly guard above rather than on the
//! nudge the kill path had already issued for it.
//!
//! # The in-kernel boundary (long in-kernel work)
//!
//! Both latches above are consumed on the way back to *user* mode, so they
//! bound how long a **user** task withholds a CPU. Kernel-side work has no
//! such return: an in-kernel service kthread that drains request after
//! request, and any kernel loop that issues one bounded operation after
//! another (a filesystem read walking a large file span by span), stays
//! inside a single dispatched body for as long as its work lasts. Nothing
//! it does is individually unbounded, and none of it busy-waits: a slow
//! device parks the body and the dispatcher runs. But when the device is
//! *fast* — an emulated virtio queue, an `NVMe` namespace whose completion is
//! already in the ring by the time the driver first polls — no operation
//! ever has to wait, so the body runs to completion without a single return
//! to the dispatch loop. The whole burst then executes with the dispatch
//! loop's housekeeping and heartbeats suspended and every other runnable
//! task on that CPU stalled behind it, which the lockup watchdog reports as
//! an in-kernel stall once the burst outlasts its threshold.
//!
//! [`yield_if_owed`] is the boundary that bounds it: in-kernel code calls it
//! between units of work, and it consumes both latches through exactly the
//! same policy [`preempt_current`] applies at the return-to-user point — both
//! go through the one private `honour_latches` decision, so the two can never
//! drift apart: honour a forced yield outright, reschedule a tick when this
//! CPU owes a switch, otherwise keep a non-tickless policy's deadline alive.
//! A caller may only place it where suspending is already sound (no spin lock
//! held); at a point the same code path can already park on a slow device, it
//! is sound by construction.
