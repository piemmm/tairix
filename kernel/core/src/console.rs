//! The kernel-side system console seam the `stream_write` (`abi-v1`
//! number 11) and `stream_read` (`abi-v1` number 13) syscalls use.
//!
//! [`ConsoleWrite`] is the output half and [`ConsoleRead`] the input
//! half; an arch port installs its discovered [`ConsoleDevice`] list
//! through the `BootInfo::with_consoles` seam (one entry per text
//! console — the video console and the UART are independent entries,
//! `plans/PI.md` P11), and the syscall handlers own the user-memory copy
//! and the capability check, never the device.
//!
//! `stream_write` lets the privileged early bring-up principals (PID 1
//! `init`, login, getty) write a byte buffer to the *hardware* console;
//! `stream_read` lets them read input back from it (the shell REPL).
//! Which device that is — the detected framebuffer when one is present,
//! else the first discovered UART (`plans/PI.md` P6) — is a boot-time
//! decision the architecture port makes from the normalised hardware
//! tree. `kernel/core` does not know how to talk to a
//! PL011, a 16550, or a framebuffer; it only knows it needs *a* byte
//! sink. [`ConsoleWrite`] is that seam: the boot path installs the
//! concrete device, and the syscall handler writes the copied-in bytes
//! through it.
//!
//! Until a console is installed the handler holds [`NULL_CONSOLE`],
//! which fails closed with [`Errno::NotImplemented`] rather than
//! silently swallowing the bytes. A build with no
//! console device wired (a headless target with no UART, an early-boot
//! state before discovery) therefore announces an intentionally inert
//! interface instead of pretending the write succeeded.
