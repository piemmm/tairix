//! Architecture-neutral kernel panic policy.
//!
//! The architecture port owns the `#[panic_handler]` attribute itself
//! (Stage 3) — `kernel/core` cannot, because in a host-test build
//! `std` already supplies a handler and registering a second one is a
//! link error. The arch port's `#[panic_handler]` is therefore a
//! one-liner that delegates here:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[panic_handler]
//! fn tairix_panic(info: &core::panic::PanicInfo<'_>) -> ! {
//!     tairix_kernel_core::handle_panic(info, &PANIC_CTX)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `PANIC_CTX` is the [`PanicContext`] the arch port builds at boot
//! and stores in a once-initialised `static` (the per-CPU bootstrap
//! exception called out by — *"No global mutable static
//! beyond the per-CPU bootstrap area"*).
//!
//! [`handle_panic`] does the rest: it logs a structured
//! [`AuditEvent::Panic`] record with the failing file, line, column,
//! and the current CPU id, then calls [`KernelArch::halt`]. It
//! **never** silently resets — the `!` return type and the `halt`
//! contract together encode that.
//!
//! A fatal CPU exception taken in kernel mode enters the same reporting
//! path through [`fault_dump`], carrying a [`KernelFault`] instead of a
//! source location: the port's synchronous-exception vector has no fix-up
//! for it, so it is as fatal as a `panic!` and deserves the same register
//! snapshot and backtrace. Only the cause fields and the audit event id
//! differ, so there is one dump, not two.
//!
//! # Testability
//!
//! `core::panic::PanicInfo` has no public constructor on stable Rust,
//! so [`handle_panic`] forwards the location into [`panic_dump`], an
//! inner function that takes `Option<&core::panic::Location<'_>>`
//! directly. Host-side tests drive [`panic_dump`] with a
//! [`core::panic::Location::caller`]; integration tests cover the
//! `panic!`-to-`handle_panic` round-trip end-to-end.
