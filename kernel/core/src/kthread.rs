//! Resumable kernel-thread task runtime (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP1).
//!
//! A `kernel/sched` task is admitted with a body closure
//! `FnMut(&mut TaskContext) -> TaskAction` that the scheduler invokes
//! once per dispatch step. That contract alone has no
//! notion of a task that *suspends mid-execution and later resumes*: the
//! body runs to a `TaskAction` and returns every time. Real multitasking
//! — and, ultimately, two EL0 user tasks timesharing a CPU
//! (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP2) — needs a task that owns a kernel stack and can
//! be parked at an arbitrary point and resumed exactly there.
//!
//! This module layers that *on top of* the closure contract without
//! changing it (the modularity guarantee): a **kthread** is a
//! resumable kernel thread driven through the Arch HAL context-switch
//! slice ([`tairix_arch_api::ContextSwitch`]). The body the
//! scheduler sees is a thin **shim** owned here; the task's real work runs
//! as a stackful coroutine on its own kernel stack.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Each kthread owns a `ThreadControl` block (heap-allocated for a
//! stable address) holding two [`TaskContext`] save areas — the task's and
//! the dispatcher's — its requested [`TaskAction`], a run-state, the work
//! closure, and its kernel stack. The shim closure handed to
//! [`tairix_kernel_sched_api::SchedulerPolicy::spawn`] does, on each
//! dispatch step:
//!
//! 1. on the **first** step, [`ContextSwitch::prepare`] the task's first
//!    frame so it lands in `trampoline`, then fall through;
//! 2. [`ContextSwitch::switch`] *into* the task (saving the dispatcher's
//!    context in `dispatch_ctx`);
//! 3. the task runs until it cooperatively suspends — [`Yielder::yield_now`]
//!    / [`Yielder::park`] switch back to `dispatch_ctx`, or the work
//!    returns and `trampoline` switches back with [`TaskAction::Exit`];
//! 4. control returns to the shim right after the step-2 switch; it reads
//!    the task's requested [`TaskAction`] and returns it to the scheduler.
//!
//! The scheduler crates (`kernel/sched/*`) are untouched.
//!
//! # Why raw pointers across the switch
//!
//! The shim (dispatcher side) and `trampoline`/[`Yielder`] (task side)
//! both reach the same `ThreadControl`, but **never concurrently**: a
//! cooperative context switch hands the single CPU from one to the other,
//! so they are temporally exclusive. To keep that sound under the aliasing
//! model, neither side holds a reference to the control block *across* a
//! switch — every access is through a raw pointer with a reference whose
//! scope ends before the switch, and the [`ContextSwitch`] handle is
//! copied out (`C: Copy`) rather than borrowed across the boundary.
//!
//! # Host vs. bare-metal
//!
//! [`ContextSwitch::switch`] only transfers control on a bare-metal target
//! (the host build's port `switch` is `unreachable!`), so the full
//! coroutine round-trip is proven by the per-arch QEMU verticals. The host
//! tests here cover the host-observable contract — the shim's state
//! machine, the fail-closed `prepare` rejection, and the stack-reclaim /
//! use-after-free discipline against the `kernel/mem` slab tag check — exactly as [`tairix_arch_api::context::conformance`]
//! tests only the host-testable `prepare`.

/// Default per-kthread kernel-stack size, in bytes — a **release-tuned
/// policy value**, not a single worst-case constant.
///
/// A **user** kthread's body does not merely set up a suspension point: once
/// it `eret`s into EL0, every syscall the task makes is handled *on this
/// stack* (the EL1 trap runs on the kthread's kernel stack). The deepest such
/// path is a full syscall dispatch — the arch trap prologue, the
/// `KernelDispatchHook` layers, a handler, and the validated user-memory copy
/// boundary ([`tairix_kernel_mem::uaccess`]) with its staging.
///
/// The working set of that path depends sharply on the optimisation level:
/// an unoptimised **debug** build spills generously at every frame, so its
/// real depth is far above an optimised build's. The charter requires a
/// resource sizing to prefer a release-tuned value over a worst-case debug
/// value where the two differ, so this bound is split by profile rather than
/// frozen at the debug worst case:
///
/// * **Debug** (`debug_assertions`): 64 KiB. Sixteen KiB was *not* enough — a
///   `wait` handler (reap + `copy_to_user`) overran a 16 KiB debug stack and
///   silently corrupted the adjacent heap allocation, the next task's frozen
///   address-space snapshot (`plans/PI.md` P6e-3b-ii) — so the debug profile
///   keeps the proven-ample 64 KiB.
/// * **Release**: 32 KiB. An optimised build's deepest dispatch frame is well
///   under half the debug working set, so 32 KiB clears it with margin while
///   halving the per-stack reservation — doubling how many stacks a given
///   arena block holds, which matters for the server profile. The production kernel image is a release build, so 32 KiB is the
///   value that actually ships.
///
/// Both values are a whole number of 4 KiB pages, so the guard page below the
/// usable region (see [`BoxStack`]) sits on a clean page boundary in either
/// profile.
///
/// This bound is **defence in depth**, not the only line of defence: the
/// [`BoxStack`] places a poison-filled guard page immediately
/// *below* the usable region, so an overrun runs off the bottom of the stack
/// into the guard instead of straight into the neighbouring heap allocation.
/// A contiguous overrun trips the guard's canary, which `dispatch_step`
/// checks every time the task hands the CPU back, and the task is then failed
/// closed rather than allowed to run on a corrupt stack. The sizing still matters — the guard absorbs an overrun but a
/// generous stack avoids one in the first place — so each profile's bound
/// must comfortably exceed that profile's deepest syscall-handler call depth.
