//! The user-execution context a process shares with every thread of its
//! thread group (`plans/THREADS.md` decision 4): its one live, mutable
//! address space, and the port's register program for resuming a thread in
//! it.
//!
//! A process's address space is process-scoped state, but the tasks that
//! mutate it are threads. [`ProcessSpace`] is therefore refcounted and
//! internally locked: each thread's kthread control block holds an
//! [`Arc`] clone, and the per-CPU publication the syscall
//! producers reach through [`crate::kthread::with_current_live_space`] takes
//! the lock for the duration of one operation. Ownership no longer rests
//! with a single task, so a second thread of the same process is a matter of
//! cloning the handle rather than of finding a new owner.
//!
//! The handle also carries the process's [`ProcessResume`] hook and its
//! port's [`EnterUser`] handle, because those are the other two things
//! process-wide that creating a thread needs. Keeping all three together is
//! what makes `thread_create` arch-neutral: it reaches the caller's own
//! handle ([`crate::kthread::current_process_space`]) and builds the new
//! thread's switch-in hook and entry from it, with no new per-arch producer
//! (decision 9).
//!
//! # Why a spin lock
//!
//! The demand-paging fault resolver mutates the space with interrupts
//! masked and cannot park, so the lock must be a spin lock rather than a
//! [`SleepLock`](crate::SleepLock). The discipline that makes that safe is
//! **never park while holding it**: every [`LiveUserSpace`] method is
//! park-free (frame allocation, a page-table write, a TLB flush), and file
//! content is read into a kernel buffer *before* the mapping call, so the
//! critical section stays bounded and short.
//!
//! The space is never touched from an interrupt handler, so a plain
//! [`SpinLock`] is correct — an `IrqSafeSpinLock` would mask interrupts for
//! page-table work no ISR can contend on.
//!
//! # Lock order
//!
//! `ProcessSpace` is acquired **before** the address-space registry
//! ([`crate::AddressSpaceRegistry`]), never after: the snapshot publication
//! reads each freshly mapped page's translation out of the live space while
//! it holds the registry write guard. No path takes the registry first and
//! the live space second.
