//! Architecture-neutral kernel entry and init sequencing.
//!
//! The contract documented in `docs/src/architecture/kernel.md` is:
//!
//! 1. [`kernel_main`] is the *only* public entry point the
//!    architecture port calls after it has built a [`BootInfo`].
//! 2. Subsystems initialise in a fixed order — `log → mem → sec →
//!    sched → ipc` — and that order is part of the kernel ABI:
//!    re-ordering would change which audit events external consumers
//!    observe (no interface creep).
//! 3. A failure in any phase is **fatal**: the failed-phase event is
//!    logged and the boot CPU enters [`KernelArch::halt`]. The kernel
//!    never silently resets (Stage 2 deliverables).
//!
//! Stage 2.7 will extend [`kernel_main`] with a syscall-registration
//! phase and replace the trailing `arch.halt()` with the dispatch into
//! the scheduler hot loop. Until then, halting after `BootCompleted`
//! is the documented contract.
//!
//! # Phase numbering
//!
//! The [`Phase`] enum is the single source of truth: the audit fields
//! emitted by every phase event carry [`Phase::as_str`], and tests
//! assert against those strings rather than line-counting log records.
