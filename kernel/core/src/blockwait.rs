//! [`IrqParkWaiter`] — the parking [`IrqWaiter`] an in-kernel block-device
//! completion wait drives.
//!
//! A block driver hosted in the kernel (the boot virtio-blk and EMMC2
//! devices behind `SharedBlock`) must give the CPU up while a device
//! completion is outstanding. Its waits run in whatever task context
//! reached the device — a user task inside an `fs_*` syscall, or an
//! in-kernel service kthread — and the wait may last milliseconds on real
//! hardware, so the discipline is the same one the `irq_wait` syscall
//! handler uses: **park the calling task off the run queue** and let the
//! device-IRQ dispatch path's [`irq_wake`](crate::waitq::irq_wake) unpark
//! it. Parking the *task* keeps the dispatch loop running everything else —
//! other tasks, the buffered console transmit top-up, the timed sweeps —
//! for the whole duration of the device wait.
//!
//! An earlier revision halted the *CPU* instead (a masked re-check + `wfi`
//! park inside the calling task). That starves the dispatch loop for the
//! whole device wait: on Pi 4 metal a cold-cache directory walk (`ls -lsR`)
//! stalled console output for every SD-card read and could strand the
//! system outright once the tickless one-shot was unarmed, because nothing
//! else was left to wake the halted CPU. The `wfi` shape survives here only
//! as the *fallback* for a context that cannot park (below).
//!
//! # Lost-wake interlock
//!
//! [`IrqParkWaiter::yield_now`] registers the current task on
//! [`IRQ_WAITQ`] **before** re-checking the
//! bound line's ready flag, and parks only if the flag is still clear — the same
//! register→re-test→park discipline `SleepLock` and the console read use.
//! A fire landing between the loop's consuming poll and the park is
//! therefore never lost: the flag re-check catches an early fire, and a
//! fire after the re-check finds the task registered, so the dispatcher's
//! wake (and the scheduler's wake-pending token) converts a racing park
//! into a re-ready.
//!
//! # Fallback park
//!
//! `reschedule_current` can suspend any dispatched kthread — a user task
//! inside its syscall trap and an in-kernel service kthread body alike
//! (both publish a resume handle). The only contexts it cannot suspend are
//! the boot flow before the dispatch loop runs its first task, and a host
//! test with no live dispatch loop; for those the waiter falls back to a
//! port-supplied, bounded CPU park (on aarch64 the race-free mask →
//! ready-re-check → `wfi` → unmask sequence). That boot context runs while
//! everything else is parked waiting on it, so briefly halting the CPU
//! there starves nothing; every steady-state wait takes the task-park path.
//! A waiter built with no fallback, for a task that only ever runs
//! dispatched, ends a wait it cannot park as [`IrqWaitAbort::Unparkable`].
