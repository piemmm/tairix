//! Kernel seat registry (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D2 — fold the input-focus
//! arbiter into a per-seat sink; `plans/PI.md` P11 — input follows the
//! surface owner).
//!
//! A **seat** is one physical display plus the keyboard and pointer attached
//! to it. This module hosts the kernel's seat: the [`tairix_seat::SeatState`]
//! owner/lease/routing state machine (the one definition shared with the
//! future user-space seat manager) under the registry's own lock, plus the
//! two input sinks that state machine routes between:
//!
//! * **Text foreground** (the default, an unowned seat): a key *press* is
//!   encoded to the console (tty) bytes a terminal sends — through the one
//!   shared [`tairix_keymap::encode_key_input`] map, never a second copy —
//!   and enqueued on the seat's text sink, where a login/shell `stream_read`
//!   drains it.
//! * **Desktop foreground** (a held seat): the whole record is routed to the
//!   seat's keyboard channel, where the seat owner (the window manager)
//!   drains it with `keyboard_read`. Pointer events take the same shape
//!   through the seat's pointer channel (`pointer_inject` → `pointer_read`),
//!   and touch frames through its touch channel (`touch_inject` →
//!   `touch_read`); while the seat is unowned both are consumed and
//!   discarded, because the text console has no pointer consumer.
//!
//! Ownership is a kernel fact, not a capability side effect: `display_acquire`
//! records the kernel-attested caller as the seat owner ([`SeatOwner`]), a
//! second task's acquire is refused (`SeatBusy`) rather than displacing the
//! holder, `display_release` and the desktop keyboard drain are owner-checked
//! (`SeatNotOwner`), and every refusal is a typed error, never a silent flip.
//! The keyboard follows the surface owner automatically — the desktop
//! analogue of "input follows the foreground tty". Routing is
//! kernel-arbitrated and capability-gated (the syscalls carry
//! `CAP_INPUT_INJECT` / `CAP_DISPLAY` / `CAP_INPUT_READ` *before* the owner
//! check); an unattached channel denies rather than leaking to a device.
