//! The peer-exit watch: how a service learns that a process it holds state
//! for has gone (`plans/ZEROCONF.md` Z4).
//!
//! A service keeping state on a client's behalf — a socket, a browse session,
//! a connection it counts — has no event when that client dies. It is not the
//! client's parent, and nothing the client left behind rings. This registry is
//! that event: a thread watches a process *instance* by the attested
//! [`ProcId`] it read from the client's `Origin`, parks on one
//! [`WaitSourceKind::PeerExit`](tairix_abi::WaitSourceKind::PeerExit) member
//! for every watch it holds, and takes each exit as it lands.
//!
//! # Why no exit is lost
//!
//! A watch is taken only on an instance the capability table still holds,
//! checked with the table's read lock held across the registration; teardown
//! removes the record under the write lock and fires only after. So a watch is
//! either registered before the removal, and fired, or finds the instance gone
//! and is refused — and the watcher learns the peer is dead either way.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! A watch names a live process and is dropped when it fires, so a thread
//! holds at most one per live process. Each watch reserves the slot its exit
//! will occupy when it is taken, so firing never allocates and never fails.
//! Watches and untaken exits die with the watching thread.
//!
//! Which instances and threads are live is shaped by what an unprivileged user
//! spawns and keeps, so every table hashes under the per-boot key. The
//! registry is built at the first watch, which a user makes and so comes after
//! the key is published.
