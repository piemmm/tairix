//! Generic blocking wait-queue with true park + timed wake (Design D P-2,
//! `plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! A reusable kernel wait primitive: a task registers on a [`WaitQueue`]
//! and *parks* (`RescheduleAction::Park`, off the run queue — no busy
//! yield), and is woken either by an **explicit event**
//! ([`WaitQueue::wake_all`]) or, when it registered with a finite deadline,
//! by the **timed wake** the architecture one-shot drives
//! ([`WaitQueue::sweep`], fed by the per-tick sweep the arch timer ISR
//! runs). The first consumer is the `hw_tree_wait` syscall, whose waiters
//! the [`HW_TREE_WAITQ`] holds and the [`crate::HwTreeSource`] store wakes
//! when the discovered hardware tree changes.
//!
//! # No lost wake-ups
//!
//! The park/unpark race — a wake delivered *after* the waiter last checked
//! its condition but *before* it commits to park — is closed in the
//! scheduler itself: `Scheduler::unpark` of a not-yet-parked task
//! records a wake-pending token that the dispatch loop's `Park` commit
//! consumes, re-readying the task instead of sleeping it. A waiter
//! therefore only ever sleeps through a wake it has *not* yet observed, and
//! always re-checks its condition after every wake, so a finished or
//! timed-out wait returns rather than parks forever.
//!
//! # Why an installed arch hook
//!
//! Waking a parked waiter needs the scheduler's `unpark`, the timed sweep
//! needs the monotonic clock, and arming the one-shot needs the arch timer
//! — none of which a global (`'static`) wait-queue can name without
//! depending on the concrete `Scheduler<A>` / arch port. The boot path installs one [`WaitQueueArch`] adapter over the
//! leaked `Scheduler` + arch, and every wake/sweep routes through
//! it. A build that never installs one (host tests of unrelated paths)
//! leaves the explicit-wake / timed-wake helpers as fail-safe no-ops.
