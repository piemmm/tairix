//! The production [`FilesystemService`]: the `fs_*` syscalls served against
//! a mounted volume (`PREREQUISITES.md` P-A).
//!
//! The hollow [`NULL_FILESYSTEM`](super::service::NULL_FILESYSTEM) default
//! fails every `fs_*` syscall closed. This module is the real producer the
//! boot path installs once the disk is mounted: [`MountedFilesystemService`]
//! resolves the caller's **kernel-attested** identity into full VFS
//! [`Credentials`] and authorises every operation through the secured VFS.
//!
//! # Concurrent, caller-context, per-mount-serialised
//!
//! Each `fs_*` operation runs in the **calling task's own context**, directly
//! against the resolved mount, so N tasks drive N concurrent operations and a
//! task waiting on a slow device completion parks on *its own* block-driver
//! IRQ wait rather than behind a single global server. Operations on
//! *different* mounts proceed fully in parallel. Within one mount the
//! filesystem driver needs `&mut self` per operation and may **park** across a
//! block-device completion IRQ ([`tairix_abi::driver::block::Block::read_blocks`]
//! parks the caller), so the per-mount lock is a scheduler-blocking
//! [`SleepLock`] held across that park — never a `lib/sync` spin lock, which a
//! second contender would busy-spin on while the holder sleeps
//! (`docs/src/architecture/sync.md`). This is the architecture a future
//! async/multi-queue `Block` overlaps operations *within* a device on, with no
//! change above the driver.
//!
//! # Identity is kernel-attested, never caller-supplied
//!
//! The syscall handler supplies the caller's owning `uid` and effective
//! capability set, both read from the task's
//! [`tairix_kernel_sec::TaskCapabilities`] — never anything the caller passed.
//! This service resolves the caller's primary and supplementary **groups**
//! from the authoritative [`IdentityTable`] keyed by that uid (a frozen,
//! credential-free index — it carries no password material), then runs
//! `Vfs::*_via_secured` so every per-inode owner/mode/ACL/`required_cap` and
//! mount-flag check stays kernel-side and fails closed. A principal with no
//! account, or a call made before the identity table or the mount is
//! installed, is denied rather than served.
