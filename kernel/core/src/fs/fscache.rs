//! Clean, rebuildable filesystem cache (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` section 6.1).
//!
//! [`CachedFs`] wraps a mounted volume's filesystem driver **below** the
//! VFS policy layer: every permission check (capability gate, ACL, mode
//! bits, mount flags) still runs in the secured VFS on every operation,
//! so a cache hit can never bypass authorisation — the cache only spares
//! the driver a repeated structural read of bytes the caller was just
//! authorised to see.
//!
//! # What is cached
//!
//! * File **data**, in page-sized chunks ([`ReclaimClass::CleanFileData`]).
//! * **Metadata** ([`ReclaimClass::FsMetadata`]): stat records
//!   (`node_info`), security records (`security`), name resolution
//!   (`lookup`), and directory entries (`read_dir`).
//!
//! Only *clean* state is cached: writes go straight to the driver
//! (write-through) and invalidate what they touch, so the cache never
//! holds dirty data and dropping any entry is always safe.
//!
//! # Coherence: one volume, one writer
//!
//! Every mutation of the volume flows through this wrapper — the `fs_*`
//! syscalls and the account-administration engine share the single
//! registered driver instance behind one `SleepLock`
//! (`LateFilesystem::register`). There is no second window onto the
//! device, so precise invalidation here is complete: `write_at` /
//! `truncate` drop the file's data and stat, `create` / `remove` /
//! `rename` drop the affected lookups, directory entries, and directory
//! stats, and `set_security` drops the node's security record. When a
//! mutation's target cannot be identified (an unexpected driver error
//! while resolving it), the **whole cache is purged** — fail closed,
//! never a stale entry. The same completeness is why the volume's
//! directory watches are fed from here ([`CachedFs::with_watch`],
//! `docs/src/filesystem/watch.md`).
//!
//! # Classification, bounds, eviction, and accounting
//!
//! At construction the cache declares its two [`CacheCandidate`]s —
//! clean file data and filesystem metadata, owned by the wrapped
//! volume, holding decrypted user data, precisely invalidated by the
//! volume's single writer, droppable on demand, with bounded per-entry
//! bookkeeping — and classifies them through the `tairix_reclaim`
//! admission gate. A refusal starts the cache poisoned: every
//! operation is served straight from the driver (fail closed, never an
//! unclassified cache).
//!
//! The cache is bounded by a [`CacheBudget`] derived from the kernel
//! heap size and accounted per class in a [`CacheAccounting`] ledger
//! (`tairix_reclaim`). An insert that would exceed the hard limit
//! first evicts least-recently-used entries down to the low watermark
//! (hysteresis), evicting file data before metadata
//! ([`ReclaimClass::reclaim_priority`]). Oversized entries (a name over
//! the component bound) are refused, never admitted unbounded. Every
//! payload buffer the cache copies is allocated fallibly
//! (`try_reserve`): allocation failure refuses the entry and the
//! operation is served straight from the driver. The remaining map-node
//! allocations are small, fixed-size, and bounded by the budget's
//! entry-overhead charge.
//!
//! # Read size is a cost, never an admission rule
//!
//! **Every** read is cached, whatever its length: a read's size decides
//! how the miss is *fetched*, never whether the bytes are retained. A
//! miss issues **one** driver call for the whole run of consecutive
//! chunks the read still needs and the cache does not hold
//! ([`ReadStage`]), so a large sequential read pays one call per run
//! rather than one per page, and a repeat of it is served from RAM. The
//! residency bound is the budget and its LRU, not a hand-picked read
//! length: a bulk read that outgrows the budget evicts its own head as
//! it streams, and the whole class drains first under pressure.
//!
//! # Secret hygiene
//!
//! The volumes this wraps are encrypted at rest, so cached file bytes
//! and names are decrypted user data: every buffer is zeroed before its
//! entry is released — on invalidation, eviction, purge, and teardown —
//! so reclaim never leaves plaintext in reusable heap memory.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! `CachedFs` lives inside the per-mount `SleepLock`, so every operation
//! holds `&mut self`: lookup racing reclaim, invalidation racing
//! rebuild, and teardown racing reclaim are impossible by construction
//! rather than by locking discipline.
