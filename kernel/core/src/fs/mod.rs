//! Virtual filesystem layer (`PLAN.md` Stage 5).
//!
//! `kernel/core::fs` owns the architecture-neutral VFS: absolute-path
//! resolution ([`path`]), the mount table and its per-mount permission
//! policy ([`mount`]), the per-inode permission model ([`perm`]), and the
//! [`Vfs`] tree that ties them together while enforcing the on-disk layout.
//!
//! The block-device and on-disk-format side of a filesystem lives in the
//! `drivers/filesystem/*` crates behind the
//! [`tairix_abi::driver::filesystem::Filesystem`] trait; this module is
//! the policy layer above them and does not duplicate their I/O. Until a
//! block-backed driver mounts, the [`Vfs`] is backed by an in-RAM node
//! arena — the natural shape of the boot-time root before storage comes
//! online.
//!
//! # Driver delegation
//!
//! A subtree may instead be backed by a `drivers/filesystem/*` driver: the
//! mount carries the driver's
//! [`DriverHandle`], and the
//! [`Vfs::read_via`] / [`Vfs::list_via`] / [`Vfs::stat_via`] methods route
//! resolution below the mount point to a
//! [`tairix_abi::driver::filesystem::FilesystemRead`] driver supplied by the
//! caller (the kernel maps the handle to the live driver). The driver
//! returns *structural* I/O only; the VFS remains the single policy
//! point, authorising every traversal against the mount point's
//! [`Metadata`] before and as it descends ([`DelegatedFs`]).
//!
//! # Layout enforcement
//!
//! * [`Vfs::with_default_layout`] provides exactly the four top-level
//!   directories the charter permits (`/System`, `/Users`, `/Apps`,
//!   `/Storage`) and mounts `/System` read-only with its `/System/Logs`
//!   and `/System/Settings` children as writable child mounts. The OS
//!   never authors the reserved legacy POSIX top-level names; refusing a
//!   user's own request to create one is not the VFS's job — a top-level
//!   create is governed by ordinary write permission on the root
//!   directory like any other.
//! * Writes to a read-only mount fail with [`VfsError::ReadOnly`].
//!
//! # Permission enforcement
//!
//! Every operation routes its access check through
//! [`perm::Metadata::authorize`]: capability gate, then ACL, then POSIX
//! mode bits, failing closed and never branching on `uid == 0`.
