//! The [`Vfs`]: an in-RAM directory tree that enforces the layout and the permission model on every operation.
//!
//! Each [`Node`] owns its children directly (a directory is a
//! `BTreeMap<String, Node>`), so resolution is a borrow walk and removal
//! simply drops a subtree — no arena, no index bookkeeping, no panicking
//! "this can't happen" fallbacks. This is the boot-time root filesystem
//! before a block-backed `drivers/filesystem/*` driver mounts; the
//! structure and the policy it enforces are identical regardless of what
//! eventually backs a subtree.
