//! The write-back expiry timer: publishing a volume whose batched
//! filesystem transaction has aged out (`plans/ARXFS-WRITEBACK.md` §10).
//!
//! A filesystem that batches commits keeps one transaction open for the next
//! operation to join, so the commit's barrier, root, and rewritten metadata
//! blocks cost once per burst instead of once per operation. The driver
//! bounds how long it will do that — a window from the device's class — but
//! it can only *check* that window from inside an operation. A volume whose
//! last write is followed by silence would therefore hold its transaction
//! until the next operation, an explicit `fs_sync`, or unmount: bounded in
//! content, unbounded in time.
//!
//! So the expiry lives here, above the driver, where Linux also puts it: one
//! kernel task parks on [`WRITEBACK_WAITQ`](crate::waitq::WRITEBACK_WAITQ)
//! until the soonest deadline any mounted volume has published, then calls
//! the ordinary [`FilesystemWrite::flush`] on each volume that is due.
//!
//! # Event-driven, not a sweep
//!
//! Nothing polls the mounts. Each driver *reports* its deadline as its
//! transaction opens and reports its absence as the transaction closes
//! ([`tairix_abi::driver::filesystem::WritebackHost`]), so the timer is armed
//! exactly once per batch and a machine with no dirty volume arms nothing and
//! takes no wakeup. A deadline
//! is **consumed** when it fires, exactly as a wait-queue deadline is: a
//! fired deadline left in place would keep the one-shot armed in the past and
//! spin the dispatch loop.
//!
//! # One flusher, in deadline order
//!
//! One task serves every mount rather than one per volume: a per-mount task
//! would cost a kernel stack per attached volume and a spawn/teardown per
//! hotplug, for a saving only a machine with several simultaneously-dirty
//! volumes would notice. It publishes in deadline order and **blocks** on
//! each mount's lock rather than skipping a busy one, because skipping means
//! dropping a consumed deadline: an operation in flight usually publishes the
//! aged-out transaction itself, but one that *fails* rolls back and leaves it
//! open, so a skipped volume could keep its transaction with nothing left to
//! fire.
