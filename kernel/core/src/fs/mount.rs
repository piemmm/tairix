//! The mount table and its per-mount permission policy.
//!
//! A mount associates a subtree (identified by its mount-point [`Path`])
//! with a set of [`MountFlags`] (`ro`, `nosuid`, `nodev`, `noexec`) and,
//! optionally, the [`MountBacking`] — the filesystem driver serving it and
//! the storage medium of the block device that driver reads.
//! The VFS consults the table on every write to decide whether the most
//! specific mount covering a path forbids it (e.g. `/System` is mounted
//! read-only; its `/System/Logs` and `/System/Settings` children are
//! writable child mounts).
//!
//! "Most specific" is the longest mount-point [`Path`] that is a prefix of
//! the queried path. The root mount (`/`) covers everything, so resolution
//! always succeeds.
//!
//! Every mutator here records its change through `MountTable::changed` under
//! the table's own lock, so a newly attached or removed volume reaches the
//! `Mounts` system notice and every directory watcher, and each converges on it
//! instead of polling (`plans/NOTICE.md`,
//! `docs/src/filesystem/watch.md`). A new mutator owes that call: the
//! alternative is a file manager whose places rail and listings silently stop
//! matching the machine.
