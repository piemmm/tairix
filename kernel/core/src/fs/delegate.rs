//! Routing VFS resolution to a `drivers/filesystem/*` driver.
//!
//! [`DelegatedFs`] adapts a borrowed
//! [`FilesystemRead`] driver to the VFS's path-resolution and permission
//! model for the subtree below a driver-backed mount point. The driver
//! supplies **structural** I/O only — it mints opaque [`NodeId`]s and
//! reports each node's kind, size, children, and bytes; it makes no
//! permission decision. Ownership, mode bits, ACLs, and
//! the capability gate stay in the VFS, which authorises every node
//! before reading it and every directory it descends into. The metadata it
//! authorises against is chosen by the [`MetaPolicy`] the call site picks:
//! [`Uniform`] applies the mount point's [`Metadata`] to every node (the
//! natural model for a filesystem like FAT that stores no per-file owner),
//! while [`PerInode`] reads each node's own stored record through
//! [`FilesystemSecurity`] (for a driver like `arxfs` that stores full
//! per-inode ownership, mode, ACL, and capability gate).
//!
//! The adapter is constructed per call with a `&mut dyn FilesystemRead`
//! rather than stored in the [`Vfs`](super::Vfs): the VFS tree is
//! `Clone + Eq`, and the live driver — mapped from the mount's
//! [`DriverHandle`](tairix_abi::driver::DriverHandle) by the kernel host —
//! is neither.
