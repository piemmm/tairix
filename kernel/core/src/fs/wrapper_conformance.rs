//! Forwarding conformance for the mount-path filesystem wrappers.
//!
//! A `Filesystem*` implementation that *wraps* an inner driver — the
//! cache ([`CachedFs`](super::CachedFs)), the storage-group identity map,
//! the boxed type-erased mount driver, a counting test shim — owes its
//! inner's whole surface. Four of the facet methods carry trait defaults
//! that answer [`DriverError::Unsupported`] so a *format* with no such
//! object can refuse honestly; in a wrapper that same default is a refusal
//! the wrapper invented, and it fails closed, so nothing crashes and no
//! ordinary test notices. That is how `read_link`/`create_link`/`link`
//! came to answer "this volume has no links" on a genuinely mounted
//! volume.
//!
//! This suite is the one place that property is stated. Each `assert_*`
//! function drives every method of one facet against [`fixture`] — an
//! inner driver that supports all of them — so any `Unsupported` reaching
//! the caller can only have come from the wrapper. Adding a facet method
//! means extending one function here, and every wrapper's test gains the
//! check at once.
//!
//! A wrapper that deliberately *replaces* a method rather than forwarding
//! it says so by asserting the replacement instead
//! ([`assert_security_replaced`]), so the divergence is declared and
//! reviewed rather than invisible.
//!
//! The premise is itself tested: `fscache_tests` runs the whole suite
//! against a bare [`RwMockFs`], so the fixture can never quietly stop
//! supporting an operation and let every wrapper's check pass vacuously.
