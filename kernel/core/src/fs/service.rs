//! The kernel-side filesystem-operation seam the userland `fs_*` syscalls
//! route through (`PREREQUISITES.md` P-A).
//!
//! The mounted volume's filesystem driver is owned for the life of the
//! system by the single disk-owning kthread (`tairix-kernel`'s driver-store
//! service); the block device cannot be shared and an operation may park on
//! the device completion IRQ. The `fs_*` syscall handlers therefore do not
//! borrow the filesystem directly — they call this [`FilesystemService`],
//! whose production implementation routes each request to that disk-owning
//! service. The handler supplies the caller's **kernel-attested** identity
//! (the owning uid and effective capability set, taken from the task's
//! [`tairix_kernel_sec::TaskCapabilities`], never anything the caller
//! supplied); the service resolves the caller's groups from the system
//! identity table and authorises every operation through the secured VFS, so
//! every per-inode owner/mode/ACL/capability and mount-flag check stays
//! kernel-side and fails closed.
//!
//! Until the boot path installs a real service the handlers hold
//! [`NULL_FILESYSTEM`], whose every operation fails closed with
//! [`Errno::NotImplemented`] — a kernel with no mounted filesystem never
//! fabricates a result.
