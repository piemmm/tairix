//! Host-only architecture mock implementing [`crate::KernelArch`].
//!
//! `TestArch` lets the host-side integration tests drive
//! [`crate::kernel_main`] and [`crate::handle_panic`] without a real
//! platform. It is gated behind `cfg(any(test, feature = "test-arch"))`
//! so production builds never link it (no hacks: a
//! production kernel must not carry a fake `halt`/`current_cpu`).
//!
//! # Driving the `!` return type of `halt`
//!
//! Real arch ports implement [`crate::KernelArch::halt`] as an infinite
//! `hlt`/`wfi` loop. Tests cannot loop forever, so `TestArch::halt`
//! records the call in an internal counter and then invokes
//! [`core::panic!`] with a sentinel message. The integration tests wrap
//! the call site in [`std::panic::catch_unwind`] to observe the halt
//! without blocking the test thread. This is the same pattern Rust's
//! `std::process::abort` test harnesses use; it is permitted here
//! because the code only exists under `cfg(any(test, feature =
//! "test-arch"))` (`panic!` allowed in tests).
