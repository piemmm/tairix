//! The kernel call-endpoint registry: a map from [`EndpointId`] to the
//! live [`CallEndpoint`] bound to it (Design D D2b — `plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! A [`CallEndpoint`] (`kernel/ipc`) is the synchronous request/reply
//! state machine the reactive driver-store file service is built on. The
//! server half lives on a never-returning kernel kthread (the disk-owning
//! driver-store service) and the caller half is the `ipc_call` syscall
//! handler (`crate::syscalls`); both must reach the *same* endpoint
//! instance. This registry is that rendezvous: the server
//! [`register`]s the endpoint it created under its well-known id,
//! and the handler [`lookup`]s the id the caller named.
//!
//! # Why a registry and not a borrowed seam
//!
//! Like [`crate::waitq::CALL_WAITQ`], the registry is global pure data
//! behind a [`SpinLock`] (never a `static mut`, so it is not the global
//! mutable static the charter forbids): the kthread server and the
//! syscall handler live in different crates and neither owns the other, so
//! a global rendezvous keyed by the well-known
//! [`tairix_abi::driver_store::DRIVER_STORE_ENDPOINT`] avoids threading an
//! [`Arc`] through `KernelState`'s cross-crate wiring. Each endpoint is held behind an [`Arc`] so the server and every
//! in-flight caller share one instance for its life.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! [`register`] refuses to overwrite a live binding (returns
//! [`Errno::AlreadyExists`] and audits the refusal as
//! [`AuditEvent::CallEndpointRegisterDenied`], mirroring the port
//! registry's register-denied event) so the kernel never silently
//! re-points a live endpoint; [`lookup`] of an unbound id yields `None`,
//! which the handler maps to [`Errno::NotFound`] and audits at that
//! boundary (mirroring [`tairix_kernel_ipc::registry::PortRegistry`]).
