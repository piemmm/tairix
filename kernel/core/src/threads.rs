//! Threads within a process: the mechanism behind `thread_create` /
//! `thread_exit` (`plans/THREADS.md` T3b).
//!
//! A process is a thread group named by its leader's `TaskId` (decision 1).
//! Every thread is a scheduler task of its own with its own kernel stack, user
//! stack, and thread pointer, and they all share one address space, one
//! capability record, one descriptor table, and one set of resource limits —
//! which is what makes a `cap_revoke` by one thread bind its siblings rather
//! than leaving a stale copy behind.
//!
//! # What creating a thread costs, and who owns it
//!
//! The kernel reserves the thread's user stack itself (decision 5a), out of the
//! process's own anonymous window and with an **unreserved guard page below
//! it**, so a stack overrun takes a deterministic fault instead of quietly
//! walking into a neighbouring mapping. The reservation is released when the
//! thread dies, which is only safe from the kernel side: the thread runs on
//! that stack right up to the syscall that ends it, so nothing in user space
//! could unmap it, and a *detached* thread has nobody watching its death.
//!
//! Its kernel stack comes from the same guarded arena a process's first thread
//! uses, and its guard page is re-expressed as unmapped in the process's live
//! root here — the first thread has that done while its root is still inactive,
//! during the image build, and a thread created later has no such moment.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Creation follows the born-parked discipline `spawn` established: every
//! bound is checked and every input validated before any state changes, the
//! task is admitted **parked**, its per-thread state is installed under the
//! returned id, and only then is it unparked — so no CPU can dispatch a thread
//! before the kernel knows what it is.
