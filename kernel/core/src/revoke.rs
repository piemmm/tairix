//! Revoking a removed device's authority from every task that holds it
//! (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D230).
//!
//! A node's grants are minted to the driver admitted for it and carried into
//! whatever it delegates, each naming the node as its origin. When the node
//! leaves the tree they are all revoked at once, so nothing new is reached
//! through them, and each holder's standing reach into the device is torn
//! down: its bindings of the node's interrupt lines (a parked wait wakes
//! `NotFound`) and its windows onto the node's registers, shot down on every
//! CPU, so its next access to one faults.
//!
//! Shared RAM is not the device. A region the node conferred stays mapped
//! wherever it is mapped, so no holder is killed, or handed fabricated
//! contents in place of a reply that already landed, for a device going
//! away; the region is retired instead, so it can never carry another
//! device's data. Only a region a node still in the tree also confers (a
//! transport a parent republished) outlives the removed session: a holder's
//! mappings of it are withdrawn and the holder killed, since its pointers
//! into them could otherwise alias whatever is mapped there next.
//!
//! Tree removal precedes revocation, and admission checks the tree after it
//! mints, so a driver admitted during a removal is revoked here or refused
//! there. A holder that maps or binds between the revocation and its
//! teardown re-checks its grant after the operation and undoes its own.
