//! The system-notice registry: one machine-wide value per topic, and the
//! generation a subscriber converges on (`plans/NOTICE.md`).
//!
//! A notice is a **state edge**. Each [`NoticeTopic`] names one value; a
//! subscriber learns only that it moved and then reads the current one. There
//! is therefore no queue here, and nothing to overflow, drop, or hold back —
//! the whole state is `(generation, payload)` per topic, and a waiter's
//! `observed` generation is the whole of its subscription.
//!
//! # Where each topic's truth lives
//!
//! A topic whose value the *kernel* already owns is not stored twice:
//! [`generation`] reads it from its own source and [`payload`] renders it on
//! demand, so the registry cannot disagree with the thing it describes.
//! Only a topic published from user space is retained here.
//!
//! | Topic | Generation | Payload |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Desktop` | a counter bumped when the published record differs | retained here |
//! | `Mounts` | a counter bumped by every mount-table mutation | none |
//! | `MemoryPressure` | the published band's depth | rendered from the gauge |
//! | `DisplayLease` | the boot seat's lease word | the same word, read from the registry |
//!
//! The display lease's word only grows across transitions, so it is its own
//! generation, and both are read from the seat registry the caller runs
//! against rather than copied here.
//!
//! # Who may observe a topic
//!
//! Every topic is readable by any process bar the display lease: when a
//! console lease is taken and given up is what the gated seat inventory
//! reports, so only the display service, which must follow it, is told it
//! ([`may_observe`]).
//!
//! The memory-pressure generation is the band depth *itself* rather than a
//! counter, so a band that deepens and relaxes again before a waiter runs
//! correctly reports nothing to do. A counter cannot express that, and the
//! desktop record is too wide to be one, so a desktop value that moves and
//! moves back wakes its subscribers once with nothing changed — which costs
//! them one read and no work, and never misses a real change.
//!
//! # Why a global
//!
//! Like [`crate::waitset`], [`crate::callreg`], and [`crate::waitq`], this is
//! global pure data behind a [`SpinLock`] (never a `static mut`, so not the
//! global mutable static the charter forbids): a topic is published from a
//! syscall, from a mount-table mutation, and from whatever was spending
//! memory when the band moved, and read from every subscriber's wake. None of
//! those owns the others, so a global keyed by the topic is the rendezvous.
