//! The discovered hardware inventory itself lives in the binding kernel
//! (`tairix-kernel`'s `HwTreeStore` / `HW_TREE`); this trait is the seam
//! `kernel/core` reaches it through, exactly as [`crate::users`]'s
//! [`UsersDbSource`](crate::users::UsersDbSource) is the seam for the user
//! database. Keeping the seam here, returning an *already wire-encoded*
//! snapshot, keeps `kernel/core` ignorant of the inventory's storage and

//! store it serialises.
//!
//! Both reads fail closed: a build with no source installed answers
//! [`Errno::NotImplemented`] so an early `hw_tree_read` / `hw_tree_wait`
//! announces an inert interface rather than fabricating a tree.
