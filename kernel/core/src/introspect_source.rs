//! The production [`IntrospectSource`] over the live kernel state
//! (`PREREQUISITES.md` P-C).
//!
//! [`KernelIntrospectSource`] is the real implementation of the
//! [`crate::introspect::IntrospectSource`] seam: it reads the authoritative
//! `CapTable`, scheduler, frame allocator, per-task limits, mount table, and
//! monotonic/wall clocks the running kernel already owns, and serialises each
//! domain into the `lib/abi` wire form the `sysinfo_introspect` syscall copies
//! out. It is built in [`crate::init`] once `KernelState` is lifted to
//! `'static`, and installed through
//! [`crate::syscalls::KernelSyscallHandlers::with_introspect`].
//!
//! **Every field is filled from kernel-attested state, never a caller claim,
//! and the source always answers with the whole system's state.** The
//! `sysinfo_introspect` syscall it backs is held only by the user-space
//! `sysinfod` broker, which re-derives every per-client scope against each
//! requester's attested `Origin`; keeping this primitive global-only holds the
//! ring-0 attack surface down while the kernel stays the identity authority.
//!
//! A read never panics and never blocks: it takes only the reader side of the
//! registries' `RwLock`s, allocates the encoded answer, and returns it.
