//! Boot-time aggregation of the system-wide common CPU-feature set.
//!
//! Every process is handed, in its startup vector
//! ([`tairix_abi::process::ProcessStart::cpu_features`]), the set of CPU
//! instruction-set extensions common to **every** core it may run on. Its
//! runtime resolves its self-optimising accelerated routines (`lib/cpuops` /
//! `lib/crc32c`) against that set: because it is the *intersection* over all
//! cores, any instruction the set advertises is legal on every core the
//! scheduler may migrate the task to, so a dispatched routine can never trap
//! after a migration.
//!
//! # Why an intersection folded per core
//!
//! A core can only read its *own* ID registers, so the intersection cannot be
//! computed from the boot CPU alone: each CPU folds the feature set it detects
//! for itself into a running AND as it comes online (the boot CPU in
//! [`crate::kernel_main`], each secondary in [`crate::run_secondary`]). Until
//! **every** expected core has contributed, [`system_features`] returns the
//! empty set — a program that resolves against it uses the portable baseline
//! everywhere, which is always correct (fail closed). The delivered value only
//! ever *grows* toward the true intersection as cores report in, never
//! advertises a feature some core lacks.
//!
//! The value is a non-secret capability fact (which instructions the silicon
//! implements), so publishing it to user space grants no authority.

///   portable baseline before it can be selected).
/// - **Page-zero**: the frame scrub (zero-before-map and the zero-on-free
///   secret scrub, `kernel/mem`) runs through it, so on a core with a
///   block-zero instruction (`DC ZVA` / ERMS) it uses the hardware path
///   (self-verified bit-identical to the portable byte fill before it can be
///   selected). A pure capability decision, never benchmarked.
/// - **Hash-table group scan**: every `lib/collections` hash container probes
///   through it, so on a core with a vector unit the sixteen-lane control
///   scan is one comparison rather than tens of scalar operations
///   (self-verified bit-identical to the portable scan before it can be
///   selected). Never benchmarked: the control bytes it reads are tags
///   derived from the per-boot hash key.
/// - **Crypto (SHA-256) backend availability**: an availability-only decision
///   whose self-verify is a FIPS known-answer self-test of the live SHA-256
///   path (`tairix_crypto::backend`). Never benchmarked (a benchmark must not
///   choose a key-timing-leaky crypto variant).
///
/// Routine selection never fails: it falls closed to the portable baseline.
/// The crypto self-test *can* fail if the audited primitive computes a wrong
/// answer — a fatal, unrecoverable boot condition (running with broken
/// cryptography is never acceptable), so this returns `false` in that case and
/// [`crate::kernel_main`] halts. Every other outcome returns `true`.
