//! Test-only counting global allocator for host-side leak soaks.
//!
//! The `plans/APPS.md` I3 reproduction needs to observe "kernel-heap
//! occupancy" on the host: a syscall-cycle soak asserts that a long run of
//! the `top -d0` refresh cycle retains no kernel memory per iteration. The
//! host test binary's heap is the process heap, so the measurement lives
//! here: a thin wrapper around [`std::alloc::System`] that keeps net
//! live-byte balances.
//!
//! Unit tests run in parallel threads inside one process, so one shared
//! counter would be perturbed by unrelated tests (including their
//! deliberately `Box::leak`ed fixtures) and make any assertion flaky. Each
//! measurement therefore owns its own [`LiveBytes`] balance: a soak opts
//! exactly the threads it owns (its caller and its server) into its own
//! counter ([`opt_in_current_thread`]), so the balance it reads is
//! deterministic regardless of what the rest of the test binary is doing.
//!
//! Compiled only under `cfg(test)`: production builds and the integration
//! test binaries never link this allocator.
