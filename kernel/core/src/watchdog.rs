//! First-class CPU-lockup watchdog: detect, diagnose, and try to recover
//! from both *soft* and *hard* CPU lockups, and make each one loud on the
//! debug console with enough context to explain the *why*.
//!
//! # What it detects
//!
//! * **Soft lockup** — a CPU that keeps taking interrupts but stops
//!   returning to the scheduler for far longer than any bounded operation
//!   should take: a runaway in-kernel loop, a task that never yields, a
//!   lock held across a wedged access. The CPU is alive at the trap level,
//!   so its own timer path can observe it.
//! * **Hard lockup** — a CPU that has stopped taking even the
//!   non-maskable watchdog sample while it is running work: wedged with
//!   maskable interrupts masked, an interrupt storm, or a dead core.
//!   The victim never runs its own tick, so **another** CPU must observe
//!   it over a channel the victim cannot mask (the port's pseudo-NMI: the
//!   aarch64 FIQ). This is the classic hard lockup a soft detector is
//!   structurally blind to.
//!
//! # The two heartbeats and the activity state
//!
//! Every CPU keeps, in its per-CPU `CpuState`:
//!
//! * a **progress** heartbeat ([`note_progress`]), stamped once per
//!   dispatch-loop iteration — "the scheduler ran here"; the soft-lockup
//!   basis;
//! * a **liveness** heartbeat ([`on_watchdog_tick`]), stamped by the
//!   port's non-maskable cadence sample (~[`tairix_arch_api::WATCHDOG_CADENCE_NS`])
//!   — "this CPU is still taking the pseudo-NMI"; the hard-lockup basis;
//! * an **activity** class ([`set_activity`]) — `Active` while it runs the
//!   dispatch loop or a task, `Idle` while parked in `wfi`, `Offline`
//!   before it comes online or after it leaves. Only an `Active` CPU owes
//!   progress, so a legitimately parked or not-yet-online CPU is never
//!   judged (fail closed).
//!
//! # How a lockup is judged
//!
//! * The port's cadence sample calls [`on_watchdog_tick`] on its own CPU:
//!   it stamps liveness, records what it interrupted (PC, task, processor
//!   state) as that CPU's last-known context — the raw "why" — then runs a
//!   **cross-CPU scan** of every *other* CPU:
//!   - liveness frozen past the hard threshold while `Active` → **hard
//!     lockup** (only this path can see it);
//!   - otherwise, progress frozen past the soft threshold while `Active`
//!     **and last seen in the kernel** → **soft lockup** (a CPU wedged in
//!     the kernel even when it is the only runnable task; a lone,
//!     preemptible *user* task owes no progress and is never flagged).
//! * The CPU's own armed timer tick also calls [`check_stall`], the
//!   same-CPU soft check. Both share the per-episode latch, so a lockup is
//!   reported exactly once whichever path sees it first.
//!
//! # Breaking a monopoly
//!
//! Detection alone leaves a wedged machine wedged, so a CPU that has not
//! returned to the dispatch loop within
//! [`DEFAULT_MONOPOLY_YIELD_THRESHOLD_NS`] is *forced* back to it
//! ([`crate::preempt::request_forced_yield`]). Both per-CPU interrupt paths
//! request it — the non-maskable cadence and the maskable timer tick — for
//! the same reason the two detectors exist: whichever channel a given wedge
//! leaves running is the one that has to break it. The tick matters most,
//! because a CPU whose cadence has stopped is precisely the CPU whose
//! cadence-driven guard has stopped with it.
//!
//! # Diagnosis and recovery
//!
//! A detection renders a rich, allocation-free record — the locked CPU,
//! the observer, how long it has been silent, the last-known interrupted
//! PC and processor state, and the running task — then asks the port to
//! break it out best-effort ([`tairix_arch_api::WatchdogArch`]): a
//! reschedule for a soft lockup, a directed attention interrupt for a
//! hard one — as forceful as the port's controller allows, which on
//! GICv2 non-secure is a maskable SGI a wedged core may never take. The
//! recovery attempt and its honest outcome are themselves on the audit
//! trail; a genuinely wedged core is reported `Unrecoverable`, never
//! silently.
//!
//! # Cost and safety
//!
//! The hot-path additions are single relaxed atomic stores (one per
//! dispatch, one per cadence sample), so normal execution is unperturbed.
//! Detection and reporting are lock-free and allocation-free, safe to run
//! from the non-maskable sample path even while a target CPU holds
//! arbitrary locks. Before the report sink / clock / recovery handles are
//! installed, or on a never-armed CPU, the watchdog emits nothing and
//! never panics (fail closed).
