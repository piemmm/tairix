//! Capability-checked, audited process-spawn caller.
//!
//! [`tairix_kernel_mem::build_process_image`] is the architecture-neutral
//! *memory mechanism*: given a validated [`tairix_abi::rxe::LoadImage`] it
//! materialises a runnable user address space (segments mapped and filled,
//! a zeroed user stack, and the `tairix_abi::process` startup-vector block)
//! and reports the [`tairix_kernel_mem::ProcessImage`] register state. It is
//! deliberately capability-agnostic and never logs (`kernel/mem` does not depend on the security policy or `lib/log`).
//!
//! This module is the *policy* half: the one path that authorises a spawn,
//! audits the decision, builds the image, and drops the calling CPU into the
//! new program through the Arch HAL [`EnterUser`] primitive. Keeping the capability gate and the audit record
//! here — in the caller, not in `kernel/mem` — is what preserves the
//! layering while still satisfying (capability check before any state
//! touch) and (security-relevant decisions are audited).
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! Spawning a program is privileged: it materialises a new principal's
//! address space and hands it the CPU. [`spawn_and_enter`] therefore
//! requires the caller to satisfy the requested [`SpawnMode`] and fails
//! closed (no ambient authority; fail closed) — the check
//! happens *before* `build_process_image` touches any page table. The hosted
//! program still receives only the capabilities its own signed manifest
//! requests intersected with its user's grants; this gate
//! authorises the *act* of spawning, it does not widen the new program's
//! authority.
