//! The kernel pseudo-terminal (PTY) object: one terminal joining a **master**
//! end (held by a terminal emulator) and a **slave** end (wired as a shell's
//! standard streams), with a full console-class line discipline layered over
//! two byte rings (`plans/PTY.md` PTY2).
//!
//! A [`Pty`] is pure data behind a `SpinLock`, mirroring [`crate::pipe::Pipe`]:
//! it never itself parks or switches context — the syscall handler drives the
//! park loop (the [`crate::waitq`] discipline), calling the non-blocking
//! [`PtyMasterEnd`] / [`PtySlaveEnd`] steps and parking on
//! [`crate::waitq::STREAM_WAITQ`] (the shared stream wait-queue) when a step
//! reports `Empty` / `Full`, under the [`RingWaits`] key of the ring side it
//! blocked on — so each of this pty's four blocking conditions wakes on its
//! own and nothing else does.
//!
//! ```text
//! terminal (master)                                   shell (slave)
//!    write ───────────►  input ring  ──[cook + signal]──►  slave read
//!    read  ◄───────────  output ring ◄─[ONLCR]────────────  slave write
//!                                     ◄─[echo]──────────────  (echo of input)
//! ```
//!
//! # The shared line discipline
//!
//! The cooking is **not** re-implemented here: input local echo, the `ONLCR`
//! output translation, and the cooked-mode `^C`/`^Z` classification are the
//! shared [`tairix_tty`] discipline the kernel console also runs, and the
//! foreground ownership is the shared [`crate::foreground::ForegroundOwnership`]
//! the console also uses. The pty is the *assembly* of those over two rings.
//!
//! - **Master write** (terminal keystrokes) is the input side: in cooked mode
//!   with a foreground job, `^C`/`^Z` are consumed and reported as signals for
//!   that job; every other byte is buffered for the slave to read.
//! - **Slave read** (the shell reading stdin) drains the input ring and, in the
//!   cooked (echoing) mode, echoes the consumed bytes onto the output ring —
//!   exactly as the console echoes at read time.
//! - **Slave write** (program/prompt output) is cooked (`ONLCR`) onto the
//!   output ring.
//! - **Master read** (the terminal rendering) drains the output ring raw.
//!
//! # Capacity
//!
//! Each ring is bounded by [`crate::pipe::PIPE_CAPACITY`], the same deliberate
//! flow-control bound a pipe uses (`plans/PTY.md`): bounding
//! the ring is what creates back-pressure, not a scaling capacity. Echo onto a
//! full output ring is dropped best-effort (echo is cosmetic), never blocking
//! the read the user asked for.
//!
//! # End lifetime
//!
//! Ends are counted through the [`PtyMasterEnd`] / [`PtySlaveEnd`] handles, as
//! [`crate::pipe::PipeEnd`] does: `Clone` increments the side's live count,
//! `Drop` decrements it and wakes the peer's waiters. When the last slave end
//! drops, a master read observes end-of-stream and a master write breaks; when
//! the last master end drops, a slave read observes end-of-stream and a slave
//! write breaks.
