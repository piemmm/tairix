//! Per-task resource-limit storage and the `rlimit_set` authorisation rule
//! (the L2 kernel enforcement of the `lib/abi` rlimit
//! contract).
//!
//! `lib/abi` ([`tairix_abi::rlimit`]) fixes the *wire* contract: the closed
//! [`LimitKind`] set, the soft/hard [`ResourceLimit`] pair, and its
//! little-endian encoding. This module is the kernel side: the [`LimitSet`]
//! a task carries (one [`ResourceLimit`] per [`LimitKind`]), the default
//! policy a task runs under until a tighter ceiling is imposed, the
//! inheritance rule a child runs through at spawn, and [`authorize_set`] —
//! the single decision the `rlimit_set` handler makes about a requested
//! limit.
//!
//! # Default policy
//!
//! Until a principal imposes a tighter ceiling, every resource is governed
//! by the discovered, growable default policy — *not* by a hard-wired
//! `const` ceiling. L2 expresses "no ceiling imposed here" as
//! [`ResourceLimit::UNLIMITED`] ([`LimitSet::DEFAULT`]); the actual
//! capacity a task can reach is bounded by the growable kernel structures,
//! which L3 sizes from the discovered hardware. The one exception with a
//! real default today is the per-task stack: its default bound
//! ([`DEFAULT_STACK_LIMIT_BYTES`]) equals the reserved user-stack span the
//! spawn layout places, so the settable limit and the structural span
//! coincide until a principal tightens (or, under
//! `CAP_RLIMIT_RAISE`, raises) it. A future discovered-hardware default
//! policy slots in by tightening [`LimitSet::DEFAULT`] (or deriving it per
//! boot); every consumer reads it through this one definition, and
//! inheritance already intersects against it so a child can never widen
//! past it.
//!
//! This is a *capacity* facility. It must never loosen the fixed
//! security/format bounds on untrusted input; those stay fixed and
//! fail closed in their own modules.
