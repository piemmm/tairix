//! Disk-backed program spawning: the `spawn` syscall's store-bundle path.
//!
//! A program the embedded boot-floor registry does not carry is resolved as
//! an on-disk `<Name>.app` bundle: the kernel reads the bundle through the
//! mounted, secured VFS under the **caller's** kernel-attested identity,
//! judges it through the one shared `tairix_appload` load gate (layout,
//! signed `AppInfo`, content hash, syscall-interface hash, `rxe` hardening
//! invariants), and spawns exactly the bytes the gate validated. App code is
//! never baked into the kernel; the bundle directory on the volume is the
//! app.
//!
//! This module supplies the pieces the syscall handler composes:
//!
//! * [`AppStore`] — the build's embedded app trust anchor plus a one-way
//!   readiness latch the boot path resolves once the `/System` mount
//!   reaches a terminal state, so an early spawn *parks* (event-woken,
//!   never a poll loop) instead of racing the mount. It also carries the
//!   per-boot **semantic launch cache** ([`LaunchCache`]): the read-only
//!   system stores are immutable for the life of the boot, so a bundle's
//!   whole-tree hash and signature are verified once and every later
//!   launch of the same bundle serves the cached, already-verified image —
//!   after re-authorising the *caller's* read of the entry point through
//!   the secured VFS, so the cache never widens authority. Launch latency
//!   is a designed hot path; re-verifying an immutable bundle on every
//!   keystroke-to-output cycle is work hoisted off it. The cache is a
//!   classified, budgeted, pressure-governed reclaimable-memory consumer
//!   (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` SMART4): the boot path that publishes the mount
//!   installs its budget and the system pressure gauge
//!   ([`AppStore::install_reclaim`]); until then — and whenever the
//!   classification gate refuses — the store serves every launch uncached
//!   through the full load gate (fail closed).
//! * [`FsBundleStore`] — the [`tairix_appload::BundleStore`] over the
//!   kernel [`FilesystemService`], with fail-closed size/depth bounds.
//! * [`AnchorVerifier`] — the [`tairix_appload::Verifier`] pinning the
//!   manifest's signer to the build's embedded app trust anchor and
//!   verifying the Ed25519 signature through `lib/crypto`.
//! * [`bundle_run_path`] — the strict `<root>/<Name>.app/Run` path shape a
//!   spawnable bundle entry point must have.
//! * [`app_error_errno`] — the fail-closed [`AppError`] → [`Errno`] map the
//!   syscall reports.
