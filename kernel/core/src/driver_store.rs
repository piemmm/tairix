//! Boot-time enumeration of the `/System/Drivers/` signed-driver store off
//! the mounted root volume (`plans/PI.md` P10
//! Stage 4.HW item 5).
//!
//! TAIRiX does not ship a compiled-in list of *which* drivers exist: the discovered driver set is found at runtime by
//! scanning the installed signed bundles under `/System/Drivers/` and
//! reading each bundle's manifest bind table. [`enumerate_driver_store`]
//! is the kernel's half of that scan — the *path enumeration* that turns
//! the on-disk store tree into the list of bundle image paths the
//! user-space driver-store scan (`tairix_drvhost::store::scan_store`)
//! reads, bind-decodes, and hands to the `devmgr` autoloader.
//!
//! It mirrors [`crate::users::load_users_db`]: given the live
//! [`FilesystemRead`] + [`FilesystemSecurity`] driver of the mounted root
//! volume (arxfs on a real installation), it builds a minimal root-backed
//! VFS (`crate::fs::root_backed_vfs`) and walks [`DRIVER_STORE_PATH`]
//! through the VFS's-checked per-inode delegation, collecting the
//! path of every regular file it finds.
//!
//! # What the walk does — and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! The walk is *structural path discovery only*. It yields the image path
//! of each regular file under `/System/Drivers/` (the store tree is
//! organised `<class>[/<vendor>]/<driver>`); it does **not**
//! read, parse, signature-verify, or otherwise trust a bundle. That is the
//! load gate's job (`tairix_drvhost::Host::load`), run only when — and
//! only when — a candidate wins a hardware-tree node.
//!
//! # Fail closed, never fatal
//!
//! Every refusal is contained to the offending entry: a sub-directory that
//! cannot be listed, an entry that cannot be `stat`-ed, a name that is not
//! a single well-formed path component, or anything past the bounds below
//! is **skipped** (counted, not collected) and the walk continues. A
//! `/System/Drivers/` that does not exist is not an error — a headless or
//! driverless install simply enumerates nothing and autoloads nothing. The scan yields whatever well-formed paths it
//! found; it never panics and never aborts the boot.
//!
//! # Credentials of the boot read
//!
//! Like the users-database read, the walk runs under the kernel's
//! bootstrap identity — `uid 0`, `gid 0`, **no** capabilities — which
//! carries no ambient power. The store directories are
//! reachable because their stored records make them searchable to
//! that identity, not because the kernel bypasses the check.
