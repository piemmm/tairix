//! Resource-reference resolution for [`resource_open`](crate::syscalls).
//!
//! TAIRiX has no `/dev`, `/proc`, or `/sys`: a typed *non-filesystem*
//! resource (a random source, a null sink, a device endpoint) is named by a
//! resource reference (`plans/ALIAS.md`), e.g. `sys:random`, not by a
//! pseudo-file. The single shared reference parser [`tairix_resref`] turns
//! the caller's string into a typed [`ResourceRef`] (spelling only — it never
//! resolves, opens, or capability-checks). This module is the kernel-side
//! *resolver*: it maps a parsed reference to a concrete [`ResourceBacking`]
//! the descriptor layer serves, checking the caller's authority per
//! namespace and failing closed on anything it does not recognise or serve.
//!
//! **This resolver serves only kernel-owned backings.** The `info:`,
//! `state:`, and `stats:` namespaces are deliberately *not* served here: they are the
//! System Information API's facts and measurements, which must flow through
//! the `sysinfod` broker so its per-principal scoping is applied. Resolving
//! them in the kernel would bypass that broker — the forbidden bypass the
//! charter and `plans/ALIAS.md` name — so they are resolved in userspace
//! (`lib/procinfo`) over the sysinfo query API, and this resolver fails them
//! closed like any other non-kernel namespace.
//!
//! Only the `sys:` namespace's unprivileged members (`sys:random`,
//! `sys:null`) are served today, and every other namespace fails closed
//! rather than fabricating a resource — but the two reasons a namespace can
//! fail are kept apart, because they mean different things to the caller:
//!
//! * A **stream-backed** namespace with no resolver wired yet (`disk:`,
//!   `tty:`, …) is [`ResolveError::UnsupportedResolver`] →
//!   [`Errno::NotImplemented`]. It could be served here later; a caller may
//!   reasonably expect this reference to open on a future build.
//! * A **value-backed** namespace ([`NamespaceBacking::Value`] — `info:`,
//!   `state:`, `stats:`) is [`ResolveError::NotAStream`] →
//!   [`Errno::NotSupported`]. It will *never* be served here: a typed value
//!   read through a broker is not a kernel byte stream, so no build of this
//!   resolver will open one and the caller is told so rather than being left
//!   to wait for a resolver that is never coming. Such a value is read
//!   *above* the kernel — by `sysinfo show`, by a tool resolving its own
//!   operand, or by the shell's read redirection, each through the broker
//!   under the caller's own identity — which is why nothing is lost by
//!   refusing it here.
//!
//! Both are fail-closed refusals; the distinction is diagnostic, and it is
//! made from the registry's own [`KnownNamespace::backing`] so the kernel and
//! the shell can never disagree about which namespaces are streams. A
//! kernel-owned namespace (a future device endpoint) gains its resolver in
//! place as its consumer appears — the resolver contract here does not
//! change.
