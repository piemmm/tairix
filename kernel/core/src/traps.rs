//! The architecture-neutral trap callbacks every port installs.
//!
//! A port's timer interrupt, its return-to-user preempt point, and its
//! reschedule IPI each need the *same* kernel-side work done; only the
//! trap plumbing that reaches them is target-divergent. These are the
//! single definitions of that work, installed directly by each port's
//! wiring rather than re-stated per port, so a new port inherits the
//! whole body and none can drive a tick that performs only part of it.
//! Three ports each carrying their own copy is how wasm32 came to drive
//! no deadline sweep at all.
//!
//! Every callback here is pure accounting except
//! [`on_user_preempt_point`], which context-switches and is therefore
//! reached only from a trap taken in user mode. That is what makes the
//! others safe on a trap taken with the kernel mid-operation.
