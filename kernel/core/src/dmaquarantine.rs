//! Custody of DMA memory a dead driver's device may still master
//! (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D167, D225).
//!
//! With no IOMMU a device keeps whatever bus addresses it was handed, whatever
//! became of the driver that handed them over. A torn-down owner therefore
//! surrenders its DMA carves here instead of to the allocator, and they return
//! to the allocator only once the device is proven quiet: a later driver
//! instance for the same hardware-tree node has reset it and says so, or the
//! node was surprise-removed because its device is gone.
//!
//! Every block remembers the admission generation of the driver that carved
//! it, and a reset frees the blocks of every earlier generation, whether they
//! are held already or surrendered later — the space that carved them may be
//! dropped after its successor has started. Three kernel-enforced facts make
//! the proofs sound. A node has at most one live driver, so a reset by the
//! live one postdates every transfer an earlier one programmed. A node id is
//! never reissued within a boot, so a reset or a removal speaks only for the
//! device the memory was handed to. And the quarantine learns every removal
//! and opens a record only for a node the tree still holds, so no carve is
//! taken for a node the tree has dropped.
//!
//! A node's record lives while the node is in the tree, so a driver carving
//! and freeing one buffer at a time never rebuilds it; once the node has left
//! the tree the record goes as soon as nothing is held or reserved for it.
//! Each carve reserves room for its own surrender, so recording a block at
//! teardown never allocates.
