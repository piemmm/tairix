//! The MMIO-map facility seam the `mmio_map` (`abi-v1` number 26) syscall
//! drives (`plans/PI.md` P10 chunk 5d-0 — the `DriverHost` MMIO/DMA surface
//! reachable over IPC).
//!
//! A user-space driver does not map raw physical memory. It maps a
//! **granted** device resource: when the device manager autoloads a driver
//! for a hardware-tree node the kernel mints the driver
//! one unforgeable handle per [`HwResource`] that node requested — and *no
//! more* (no ambient authority). The `mmio_map` syscall takes such a
//! handle (plus the `[offset, offset + len)` sub-region to map) and the
//! kernel resolves it **against the calling task** through the per-task
//! grant table that lives in
//! [`AddressSpaceRegistry`](crate::aspace::AddressSpaceRegistry) (minted at
//! driver admission, reclaimed when the task is withdrawn on exit — the same
//! per-process lifecycle as the task's streams and limits, so handle forgery
//! is rejected exactly as `irq_wait` re-checks its binding). This
//! module owns the two pieces of the handler that are *not* that table:
//!
//! * [`mappable_subwindow`] — the input-validation half: confirm a resolved
//!   grant names a memory window `mmio_map` can map and the requested
//!   sub-region lies wholly inside it, returning that sub-region's
//!   `(phys_base, len)`, or a fail-closed [`Errno`].
//! * [`MmioMapFacility`] — the *mechanism* half: map a validated physical
//!   window into the caller's live address space. Naming a port's concrete
//!   page table and direct physical map is irreducibly architecture-specific, so — like [`crate::memmap::MemMap`] — the
//!   concrete producer is installed at boot through a `with_*` builder and
//!   the handler reaches it through this trait. Until one is installed the
//!   handler holds [`NULL_MMIO_MAP_FACILITY`], which fails closed with
//!   [`Errno::NotImplemented`].
//!
//! Keeping the grant *policy* in the per-task registry (where the
//! capability/grant decision belongs) and the page-table
//! *mechanism* behind this trait keeps page-table knowledge out of
//! `kernel/core`.
