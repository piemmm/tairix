//! Stable audit-log event IDs for `kernel/core`.
//!
//! Every architecture-neutral init-time and panic-time decision taken
//! by the kernel entry crate emits exactly one structured log record
//! through [`tairix_log`]. The numeric identifiers are part of the
//! audit contract with external log consumers and
//! may not be re-used or re-numbered.
//!
//! Per the range convention established in `lib/log` (subsystems pick
//! ranges of `1_000`), `kernel/core` owns `4_000..5_000`. Earlier
//! subsystems already published the lower ranges:
//!
//! * `1_000..2_000` — `kernel/sec`
//! * `3_000..4_000` — `kernel/ipc`

//! |-----:|-------|-------------------------------|--------|------|
//! | 4000 | Info  | `KERNEL_BOOT_STARTED`         | audit  | `kernel_main` entered, before any subsystem init. |
//! | 4001 | Info  | `KERNEL_PHASE_STARTED`        | log    | An init phase began. The `phase` field names it. |
//! | 4002 | Info  | `KERNEL_PHASE_READY`          | log    | An init phase completed successfully. |
//! | 4003 | Error | `KERNEL_PHASE_FAILED`         | audit  | An init phase failed; the kernel will halt. |
//! | 4004 | Info  | `KERNEL_BOOT_COMPLETED`       | audit  | Every init phase finished; control passes to the scheduler. |
//! | 4010 | Error | `KERNEL_PANIC`                | audit  | The kernel panicked; the handler logged context and is about to halt. |
//! | 4011 | Error | `KERNEL_FAULT`                | audit  | A fatal CPU exception was taken in kernel mode. The `syndrome`, `fault_addr`, `fault_pc`, and `fault_sp` fields name the port's exception syndrome, the faulting address, the faulting instruction, and the kernel stack it ran on, each `null` where the CPU gave none; the register and `frame_N` blocks are the panic dump's. |
//! | 4020 | Error | `SYSCALL_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE` | audit  | The dispatcher reached a syscall handler whose backing subsystem is intentionally not yet wired in (see `KernelSyscallHandlers`). The `feature` field names which deferral was hit. |
//! | 4021 | Error | `SYSCALL_NO_CALLER_CONTEXT` | audit | A syscall fired on a CPU with no current task, or whose current task has no capability record. The `KernelDispatchHook` emits this then signals the bin-crate callback to halt the CPU. |
//! | 4030 | Info  | `PROCESS_SPAWNED`             | audit  | A process was spawned: its image was built and the CPU is about to enter it in user mode. The `entry` field carries the relocated entry-point VA. |
//! | 4031 | Error | `PROCESS_SPAWN_DENIED` | audit | A spawn was refused, the `cause` field naming why: the caller holds no spawn authority, or the session placement was refused before any of the child existed. `cause=session_ending` is a child refused at admission because its session began ending while it was built: it never runs and its parent reaps it as killed, and the `task`, `proc` and `comm` fields name it. |
//! | 4032 | Error | `PROCESS_SPAWN_FAILED`        | audit  | A spawn was authorised but building the process image failed; the partially built address space is discarded. The `cause` field names the `SpawnError`. |
//! | 4036 | Info/Warn | `PROCESS_SIGNAL_CROSS_PRINCIPAL` | audit | The `signal` syscall's cross-principal authority decision, reached only once the target is not the caller's own child: allowed (`Info`) by same-uid or `CAP_PROC_CONTROL`, denied (`Warn`) otherwise. The `caller`, `pid`, `target`, `signal`, and `rule` fields name the decision. |
//! | 4037 | Info/Warn | `PROCESS_PRIORITY_CHANGE` | audit | A `sched_set_priority` decision that needed authority beyond the caller's own child: a cross-principal target (same-uid or `CAP_PROC_CONTROL`) or a raise toward `High` (always `CAP_PROC_CONTROL`). Allowed is `Info`, denied is `Warn`; the `caller`, `pid`, `target`, `priority`, `rule`, and `raise` fields carry the decision. An own-child lowering is the caller's standing grant and is not recorded here. |
//! | 4038 | Info | `SESSION_MEMBER_ENDED` | audit | A process was killed because the session it belongs to ended with the process that session is anchored at. The `task`, `proc`, `comm`, and `session` fields name the process, its instance, its name, and the anchor's instance. |
//! | 4039 | Warn | `SESSION_REAPER_UNAVAILABLE` | audit | The session reaper could not be started; each session is ended on the path its anchor's death lands on. |
//! | 4040 | Info  | `USERS_DB_LOADED`             | audit  | `/System/Security/Users` was read off the mounted root volume and parsed; the `records` field carries the account count. |
//! | 4041 | Error | `USERS_DB_REJECTED` | audit | The users database could not be read or failed validation; no `UsersDb` is held and every login refuses (fail closed). The `cause` field names the refusal. |
//! | 4042 | Info | `DRIVER_STORE_SCANNED` | audit | The `/System/Drivers/` signed-driver store was enumerated for autoload candidates. The `drivers` field carries the count of bundle image paths found; `skipped` the count of entries refused fail-closed during the walk. |
//! | 4045 | Info | `USER_ADMIN_APPLIED` | audit | A `CAP_USER_ADMIN` account-administration operation was validated, persisted, and made live. The `op`, `target`, and `caller_uid` fields name the operation, the affected account/group, and the kernel-attested caller. |
//! | 4046 | Warn | `USER_ADMIN_REJECTED` | audit | A `CAP_USER_ADMIN` account-administration operation was refused; nothing changed (fail closed). The `op`, `target`, `caller_uid`, and `errno` fields name the operation, the affected account/group, the caller, and the refusal. |
//! | 4050 | Info | `INPUT_DELIVERED` | audit | An input driver delivered the **first** record of its kind to the input-focus arbiter — `kind=key` for the first `key_inject` edge, `kind=pointer` for the first `pointer_inject` record, `kind=touch` for the first `touch_inject` frame. Emitted at most once per input kind over the kernel's lifetime, carries no event content or timing — it witnesses that an autoloaded driver of that class is live, never a per-event record. |
//! | 4051 | Info | `SEAT_SWITCHED` | audit | A `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` `seat_switch` retargeted a seat's foreground text console. The `seat` and `console` fields name the seat and the new foreground. |
//! | 4052 | Warn | `SEAT_LEASE_REVOKED` | audit | A `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` `seat_revoke` forcibly evicted a seat's lease holder. The `seat` and `evicted` fields name the seat and the evicted owner's task id. |
//! | 4100 | Info | `FS_NODE_MUTATED` | audit | A capability- and permission-checked filesystem mutation succeeded (`fs_mkdir`/`fs_unlink`/`fs_rename`/`fs_set_mode`/`fs_set_owner`). The `op`, `uid`, and `path` fields name the operation, the caller's kernel-attested uid, and the target; `to` carries a rename's destination, `mode` a chmod's new mode (octal), and `owner`/`group` a chown's new ids. Paths are bounded to the log field limit. |
//! | 4087 | Warn | `DMA_TRANSLATION_BYPASS` | audit | Discovery left a function behind a translation unit unpublished because it would not use the unit: a virtio function offering no `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM`. The `address` field names the function's requester id and `unit` the unit's node. |
//! | 4088 | Warn | `DMA_TRANSLATION_FAULT` | audit | A translation unit refused a device's access. `unit`, `stream`, `iova`, `access` and `reason` name it; `node` is the device's node where a domain owner holds the stream, and absent for a stream no owner holds; `suppressed` counts the faults the unit's budget left unrecorded since its last record. |
//! | 4089 | Error | `DMA_TRANSLATION_STORM` | audit | A stream raised faults past its budget's storm threshold in one window: it was silenced and its `node`, where one holds it, marked `Offline`. Carries the fault's fields and `outcome`: `silenced`, or why the unit could not. |
//! | 4091 | Warn | `DMA_QUARANTINED` | audit | A driver ended holding DMA memory its device may still master; it passed to its node's quarantine, not the allocator. The `node`, `generation` and `bytes` fields name the node, the dead driver's admission generation, and what it held. |
//! | 4092 | Info | `DMA_QUARANTINE_RELEASED` | audit | Quarantined DMA memory returned to the allocator, scrubbed. `cause` is `reset` (a later driver for the `node` declared its device reset; recorded even when nothing was freed) or `removed` (a surprise removal retired the node; recorded only when something was freed); `bytes` is what was freed. |
//! | 4093 | Info | `HW_NODE_GRANTS_REVOKED` | audit | A removed hardware-tree `node`'s authority was revoked from every task holding it: `grants` revoked across `holders` tasks, whose bindings of its interrupt lines, windows onto its registers and mappings of its shared regions were torn down. `killed` counts holders whose access could not be torn down and which were killed instead; the record is Warn when it is non-zero. |
//! | 4094 | Info/Warn | `DMA_TRANSLATION_UNIT` | audit | A translation unit discovery reported was brought up, or left its devices unconfined. `node` is the unit's node and `outcome` is `translating`, the refusal (`unmatched`, `no_registers`, `exhausted`, `unconfirmed`, `hardware`, `refused`), or `faults_unrouted` with a `reason` when its fault interrupt could not be served. |
//! | 4095 | Error | `DMA_TRANSLATION_UNCONFIRMED` | audit | A unit could not confirm that a translation ended — a driver's domain, a removed node's, or one carve's — so what it reached is kept for good. Carries `node` and `generation`. |
//! | 4101 | Warn | `FS_MUTATION_DENIED` | audit | A filesystem mutation was refused by the secured VFS; nothing changed (fail closed). Carries the same `op`/`uid`/`path`(/`to`/`mode`/`owner`/`group`) fields as `FS_NODE_MUTATED` plus the refusal's `errno`. |
//! | 4130 | Warn | `VOLUME_DEGRADED`   | audit | A served volume's backing block device reported itself unhealthy while still serving I/O. Emitted once on the edge into `Degraded`; the `dev` field names the block-service endpoint. |
//! | 4131 | Warn | `VOLUME_RECOVERING` | audit | A served volume's backing block device stalled/reset and entered its bounded recovery grace window. Emitted once on the edge into `Recovering`; `dev` names the block-service endpoint. |
//! | 4132 | Info | `VOLUME_RECOVERED`  | audit | A degraded/recovering volume returned to healthy service (the disk came back). Emitted once on the edge back to `Available`; `dev` names the block-service endpoint. |
//! | 4133 | Info | `SYSTEM_POWER`      | audit | A `system_power` transition was admitted: every mounted volume flushed and the platform is about to be asked to stop. The `caller` and `action` fields name the kernel-attested requester and the requested transition (`power-off`/`restart`). |
//! | 4140 | Info | `HW_NODE_REMOVED`   | audit | An owned hardware-tree node was retired by `hw_remove_node`. The `node` field names the removed node and `mode` the removal posture (`surprise` for a vanished device, `orderly` for an idle stop-if-idle retirement). |
//! | 4141 | Warn | `HW_NODE_REMOVE_REFUSED` | audit | An orderly `hw_remove_node` was refused because a volume is still attached on a block-service endpoint the node declares; nothing was removed (fail closed, `Errno::Busy`). The `node` field names the node left in place. |
//! | 4150 | Warn | `TASK_LATENCY_OVERRUN` | log | An interactive surface overran the frame budget it declared with `latency_watch`. The `budget_ms`/`elapsed_ms`/`blocked_ms`/`calls` fields say where the budget went, `blocked_in` names the syscall that carried the span over, `top_calls` names the syscalls the span made most (which is what a stall spent in thousands of short calls has instead of one culprit), and `pc`/`bt` carry the stalling code as offsets into the program's own load base. Debug images only. |
//!
//! "audit" events route through the `audit_sink` channel
//! (security-relevant decisions); "log" events
//! route through the diagnostic `log_sink` channel. Production
//! kernels typically wire both sinks to the same COM1 backend, so
//! both channels are visible on the boot console; QEMU integration
//! tests intercept the audit channel only.
//!
//! Adding a new event requires assigning the next free identifier in
//! this file and updating the table in
//! `docs/src/architecture/kernel.md`.
