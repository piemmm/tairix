//! TAIRiX Arch HAL — the architecture hardware-abstraction layer.
//!
//! `kernel/arch/api` is the closed set of traits that every
//! architecture port (`kernel/arch/<target>`) implements and the rest
//! of the kernel consumes. It is the
//! boundary that keeps the architecture pluggable: a port names only
//! this crate (and `lib/*`), never a concrete kernel subsystem, and
//! no kernel crate names a concrete arch port — both sides meet here.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This crate currently hosts the **scheduler-facing** slice of the
//! HAL — the per-CPU identity, the monotonic tick source, and the
//! inter-processor preemption hook the SMP scheduler drives through
//! [`SchedulerArch`] — the **side-channel mitigation** slice: the [`SideChannelMitigation`] trait and its
//! [`sidechannel::conformance`] vertical — and the **memory-tagging**
//! slice: the [`MemoryTagging`] trait, its
//! [`memtag::conformance`] vertical, and the architecture-neutral
//! [`MemTag`] / [`next_free_tag`] tag algebra that hardens
//! use-after-free — and the **enter-user-mode** slice: the [`EnterUser`] trait and the architecture-neutral
//! [`UserEntry`] register state that drops a freshly built process image
//! into user mode via the port's native transition (`sret` on riscv64,
//! `eret` on aarch64, `iretq` on x86_64) — and the **early-boot
//! platform-discovery** slice: the
//! [`PlatformDiscovery`] trait that normalises a target's native
//! hardware source into the [`tairix_abi::hwtree`] hardware tree, plus
//! its [`platform::conformance`] vertical — and the **per-CPU storage**
//! slice: the [`PerCpu`] trait that reads and writes
//! the calling CPU's per-CPU base word (GS base on x86_64, `TPIDR_EL1`
//! on aarch64, `tp` on riscv64, a per-worker slot on wasm32), plus its
//! [`percpu::conformance`] round-trip + isolation vertical — and the
//! **interrupt entry/exit** slice: the
//! [`IrqController`] line-masking trait and the [`InterruptEntry`]
//! claim/complete prologue/epilogue every claim-based port exposes, plus
//! their [`irq::conformance`] verticals — and the **timer-programming**
//! slice: the [`Timer`] trait that installs the one
//! scheduler-tick callback and dispatches a tick to it (the LAPIC timer,
//! the EL1 generic timer, the SBI timer, and the wasm32
//! `requestAnimationFrame` loop all drive it), plus its
//! [`timer::conformance`] vertical — and the **context-switch** slice: the [`ContextSwitch`] trait that seeds a
//! never-run task's first frame ([`ContextSwitch::prepare`]) and performs
//! the port's native task switch ([`ContextSwitch::switch`]) over the
//! architecture-neutral [`TaskContext`] save area, plus its
//! [`context::conformance`] vertical — and the **MMU/page-table** slice: the [`AddressSpace`] trait that installs a 4 KiB
//! mapping ([`AddressSpace::map_page`]), reports the root-table physical
//! address ([`AddressSpace::root_phys`]), and activates the translation
//! regime ([`AddressSpace::activate`]) over the neutral [`PageFlags`]
//! permission set, plus its [`mmu::conformance`] vertical — and the
//! **TLB-shootdown** slice: the [`TlbShootdown`]
//! trait whose [`TlbShootdown::flush_page`] the per-process map/unmap
//! path drives to invalidate one CPU's stale cached translation
//! (`invlpg` / `tlbi vae1is` / `sfence.vma`), plus its
//! [`tlb::conformance`] vertical — the MMU slice also carries the
//! **fault-guarded user-copy** extension ([`uaccess`]): the set-once
//! [`GuardedCopyFn`] slot each port's fault-windowed span copy is
//! published through, so a hardware fault taken mid user-copy resumes at
//! the window's fix-up and surfaces as an error instead of the fatal
//! path, plus its [`uaccess::conformance`] checks — the **trap-path callbacks**
//! ([`fault`]) every port hands the faults it cannot finish — and the
//! **cross-CPU TLB-shootdown**
//! slice (`plans/WIRING.md` W6): the
//! [`CrossCpuTlbShootdown`] trait whose [`CrossCpuTlbShootdown::shootdown_page`]
//! invalidates a stale translation on *every* online CPU (an x86_64
//! IPI + acknowledge, an aarch64 inner-shareable `tlbi ...is` broadcast,
//! a riscv64 SBI `remote_sfence_vma`), plus its [`xtlb::conformance`]
//! vertical — and the **page-table frame-source**
//! slice (`plans/WIRING.md` W5b-3): the
//! [`PageTableFrames`] trait a port draws its root and intermediate
//! tables from (as [`TableFrame`]s), so a real per-process address space
//! is backed by the `kernel/mem` frame allocator while the static
//! `PageTablePool` stays the boot/bootstrap source, plus its
//! [`frames::conformance`] vertical — and the **SMP secondary-CPU
//! bring-up** slice (`plans/WIRING.md` W14): the
//! [`SecondaryBringup`] trait whose [`SecondaryBringup::start_secondary`]
//! starts a parked logical CPU (an x86_64 INIT-SIPI-SIPI handshake, an
//! aarch64 PSCI `CPU_ON`, a riscv64 SBI HSM `hart_start`, a wasm32 Web
//! Worker spawn), plus its [`smp::conformance`] vertical — and the
//! **machine-takeover** slice (`plans/NEW-SUPERVISOR.md` §9): the
//! [`MachineTakeover`] trait whose single [`MachineTakeover::take_over`]
//! operation hands the whole machine over to the pre-boot Supervisor's
//! one-way whole-RAM test — quiesce the other CPUs, mask
//! interrupts, stop the watchdog, flatten paging, run the sweep on a reserved
//! stack, then reset (it never returns on success) — plus its
//! [`takeover::conformance`] vertical. It also hosts
//! the ** conformance
//! vertical** ([`conformance`]): the harness every port runs over its
//! real HAL handles so parity is *enforced* rather than asserted by
//! inspection (`plans/WIRING.md`). The remaining HAL surface enumerated
//! by is now complete: the last ad-hoc slice — SMP
//! secondary-CPU bring-up — became the [`SecondaryBringup`] trait in
//! Stage W14 (`plans/WIRING.md`). Until a future primitive lives here it
//! stays in its current owning crate, and the move is tracked, not
//! silently duplicated.
//!
//! It also hosts the **CPU-feature-detection** slice: the [`CpuFeatures`]
//! trait that turns each target's CPU-ID source (`CPUID`,
//! `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1`/`ID_AA64PFR0_EL1`, `misa` + the device-tree ISA
//! string, the wasm32 host query) into one arch-neutral [`CpuFeatureSet`]
//! and [`CoreType`] key — the deterministic capability layer the
//! `lib/cpuops` self-optimising dispatch framework
//! (`plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md`) gates on — plus its
//! [`cpufeatures::conformance`] vertical, and the **CPU cycle-counter**
//! slice: the [`CpuCycles`] trait that reads the per-core cycle count
//! (`rdtsc` / `PMCCNTR_EL0` / `CNTVCT_EL0` / `rdcycle` /
//! `performance.now()`) the `lib/cpuops` microbenchmark measures over,
//! plus its [`cpucycles::conformance`] vertical.
//!
//! # Why `no_std` and dependency-light
//!
//! the charter permits `kernel/arch/api` to depend on `lib/*` only. The crate
//! is `no_std` and allocator-free, and names `lib/*` crates alone — the
//! hardware-tree ABI the [`PlatformDiscovery`] slice speaks in, the log line
//! shape the [`fatal`] report is written in — so an architecture port
//! implementing the HAL acquires no transitive edge to a concrete kernel
//! crate, and the architecture-neutral kernel can name the HAL without
//! inheriting an arch dependency.

#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// The device-tree fixture builder the `fdtwalk` tests compose their trees
// with returns owned blobs, and the collecting sink they walk into grows.
// Test scaffolding only; the crate itself stays allocator-free.
