//! Post-mortem CPU-state capture and stack-unwind surface of the Arch HAL.
//!
//! A kernel panic is fatal, non-recoverable, and halts the offending CPU,
//! so its dump should carry everything a post-mortem needs: a read-only
//! snapshot of the general-purpose registers and a bounded walk back up
//! the call stack. Capturing the register file and knowing how one stack
//! frame is laid out is genuinely target-divergent (the register set, the
//! ABI frame-pointer convention, the privileged reads), so it is a closed
//! trait set on the Arch HAL; this module is that set, modelled on the
//! [`super::memtag`] and [`super::sidechannel`] surfaces.
//!
//! # What lives here
//!
//! * [`CpuStateCapture`] — the per-port handle the panic path reaches
//!   through. It [captures](CpuStateCapture::capture) the registers, states
//!   the port's [frame layout](CpuStateCapture::frame_layout), reports the
//!   calling CPU's [rooted boot stack](CpuStateCapture::boot_stack) and
//!   [its poison guard](CpuStateCapture::boot_stack_guard), and declares
//!   its honest [profile](CpuStateCapture::profile).
//! * [`BootStackGuardRegion`] / [`BootStackGuard`] — the guard below the
//!   boot stack and the verdict read off it. The boot stack is in use
//!   before the MMU is on, so an overrun cannot be caught by a hole in the
//!   address space; the sentinel and the window checked for it are
//!   `lib/memguard`'s, shared with every other guarded region.
//! * [`RegisterSnapshot`] / [`NamedReg`] — the architecture-neutral,
//!   allocation-free register-file snapshot. `pc`/`sp`/`fp` are explicit
//!   because the neutral unwinder needs them; the rest are named pairs.
//! * [`FrameLayout`] — the *only* arch-specific unwinding datum: the byte
//!   offsets from a frame pointer to the saved caller frame pointer and
//!   the saved return address. The actual (bounds-checked, monotonic,
//!   depth-capped) walk is arch-neutral and lives once in `kernel/core`,
//!   reading memory only through a [`StackReader`] — so the dangerous
//!   dereference has exactly one audited site, never one per port.
//! * [`Backtrace`] / [`BacktraceProfile`] — the honest declaration,
//!   exactly like [`super::memtag::Tagging`] / [`super::sidechannel::Mitigation`]:
//!   a feature is [`Backtrace::Supported`] or [`Backtrace::Unsupported`]
//!   (with a justification — the port genuinely cannot do it).
//! * [`walk`] — the arch-neutral frame-pointer unwinder every port shares.
//! * [`conformance`] — the conformance vertical every port runs against
//!   its handle.
