//! MMU / page-table surface of the Arch HAL.
//!
//! Mapping a virtual page to a physical frame, switching the active
//! translation regime, and reading the root-table physical address are
//! privilege-neutral but deeply architecture-specific: x86_64 walks a
//! four-level PML4 and loads `CR3`, riscv64 walks an Sv39 hierarchy and
//! writes `satp`, aarch64 walks a three-level stage-1 table and programs
//! `TTBR0_EL1` + `SCTLR_EL1.M`. The charter makes the architecture surface a
//! closed set of traits on the HAL; this module is the "MMU/page-table"
//! member of that set, so the page-table primitive lives behind one
//! vocabulary instead of being re-described at every call site. The parallel per-arch implementations of this one
//! trait are the deliberate shape of modularity, never
//! collapsed behind `cfg` (carve-out).
//!
//! # What lives here
//!
//! * [`PageFlags`] — the architecture-neutral permission/attribute set a
//!   page leaf carries. Each port translates it into its native
//!   page-table-entry bits at the HAL boundary (one neutral vocabulary). The default policy is W^X: a leaf is
//!   never both [`PageFlags::WRITE`] and [`PageFlags::EXEC`].
//! * [`MapError`] — the fail-closed result of installing a mapping. A
//!   bad address or an exhausted page-table pool is rejected, never
//!   silently truncated or clobbered.
//! * [`AddressSpace`] — the per-port handle the kernel reaches through.
//!   It installs a 4 KiB mapping ([`AddressSpace::map_page`], host-testable
//!   walk/encoding math), activates the translation regime
//!   ([`AddressSpace::activate`], the port's privileged register write),
//!   and reports the root-table physical address
//!   ([`AddressSpace::root_phys`]).
//! * [`conformance`] — the conformance vertical: a host-run
//!   [`conformance::run_all`] check every paging-capable port runs over
//!   its real [`AddressSpace`], proving the fail-closed `map_page`
//!   contract (a non-zero root, misaligned addresses rejected, a good
//!   mapping accepted, a double mapping refused).
//!
//! # Why `map_page` is host-tested but `activate` is not
//!
//! [`AddressSpace::map_page`] is pure page-table-walk and entry-encoding
//! arithmetic over a caller-supplied address pair, so it runs and is
//! asserted on the host exactly like the [`crate::context::conformance`]
//! vertical. [`AddressSpace::activate`] is only meaningful on the
//! bare-metal target — it loads a translation regime and the *next*
//! instruction fetch runs under it, which cannot be observed from
//! `cargo test` — so, like [`crate::ContextSwitch::switch`] and
//! [`crate::EnterUser::enter_user`], it carries no host conformance
//! check; it is proven end-to-end by each port's `memory_isolation`
//! QEMU vertical (two address spaces that disagree about one address,
//! and the CPU faults the one without the mapping). Inventing a host
//! stub that "activates" would be a fake primitive.
//!
//! # Scope (the burn-down)
//!
//! This is the `plans/WIRING.md` **Stage W5b-1** slice: the bootstrap
//! page-table primitive every port already owns, lifted behind one HAL
//! trait and exercised by the `memory_isolation` verticals through it.
//! Wiring `kernel/mem`'s allocator-backed per-process address space onto
//! this trait, and the per-page + cross-CPU TLB shootdown (which depends
//! on the aarch64 IPI from Stage W6), are the tracked Stage W5b-2 / W6
//! follow-ups — not silently duplicated here.
