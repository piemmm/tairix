//! The generic flattened-device-tree → hardware-tree walk every FDT-based
//! port shares.
//!
//! Turning a device tree into [`HwNode`]s is the same job on every such
//! port: emit the root, walk the tree in document order tracking each
//! depth's bus cells and `ranges` ([`tairix_fdt::bus`]), classify each node,
//! decode its `compatible` list into match keys, translate its `reg`
//! windows, and splice out the nodes no driver could ever bind. Only two
//! things genuinely differ, and [`FdtPlatform`] is exactly those two:
//!
//! * **the interrupt specifier** — its cell width and the mapping from its
//!   cells to the line number a granted driver binds (the GIC's type-relative
//!   SPI/PPI offsets, the PLIC's bare source number);
//! * **board augmentation** — extra resources only the platform's own tree
//!   can describe (a firmware mailbox's DMA carve, a root complex's
//!   windows, a vendor spelling of a generic property). Ports with none
//!   leave the defaults.
//!
//! A port therefore contributes an [`FdtPlatform`] impl and spells its
//! discovery type as [`FdtDiscovery`] over it; the walk itself has one
//! definition. The impl is a *value* built from the tree once
//! ([`FdtPlatform::from_tree`]), so a port whose interrupt mapping depends
//! on a tree-wide fact — the RISC-V PLIC's `riscv,ndev` source count — reads
//! it before the walk rather than per node.
//!
//! The generic DMA binding is read here for every port: a node with
//! `#dma-cells` is a controller carrying a [`DmaControllerDuty`] and its
//! bus's DMA windows, and each `dmas` entry of a consumer becomes a
//! [`DmaRequestLine`] naming the controller's endpoint (`plans/SOUND.md`
//! SND5).
