//! Page-table frame-source surface of the Arch HAL (
//! `plans/WIRING.md` Stage W5b-3).
//!
//! A port's `AddressSpace` is built from 4 KiB page-table frames: the
//! root table and every intermediate table on a mapping walk. Until
//! Stage W5b-3 each port *owned* that storage in a static
//! `PageTablePool` linked into the kernel image. That is fine for the
//! boot/bootstrap address space, but a real per-process address space
//! must draw its tables from the kernel's physical `FrameAllocator`
//! (`kernel/mem`) so the tables live in ordinary reclaimable RAM rather
//! than a fixed-size `.bss` pool.
//!
//! the charter forbids `kernel/arch/*` from depending on `kernel/mem`, so the
//! allocator cannot be named by a port directly. This module is the
//! seam that keeps the one-way edge intact: a port draws each table
//! through [`PageTableFrames`], and the *caller* (`kernel/mem`, which is
//! allowed to depend on this crate) supplies the concrete source. The
//! static `PageTablePool` each port still ships is the boot/bootstrap
//! implementation of the same trait; the `FrameAllocator`-backed
//! implementation lives in `kernel/mem`.
//!
//! The parallel per-source implementations of this one trait — the
//! per-port static pool and the `kernel/mem` allocator adapter — are the
//! deliberate shape of modularity, never collapsed behind a
//! `cfg` (carve-out).
