// TAIRiX aarch64 boot trampoline. Board-independent: it serves both the
// QEMU `virt` board and the Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711). Only the load
// address differs between boards, and that lives in the per-board linker
// script (`aarch64-virt.ld` / `aarch64-rpi4.ld`) — the
// "boot stubs" carve-out (`plans/PI.md` §0.2). Every other board
// difference is discovered device-tree data, never a fork of this stub.
//
// The loader (QEMU `-kernel <elf>`, or the Pi firmware loading
// `kernel8.img` at 0x8_0000) enters `_start` with the Linux aarch64
// boot-protocol hand-off:
//
//   x0 = physical address of the flattened device tree (DTB)
//   x1..x3 = 0 (reserved)
//
// Entry exception level varies by board: the default `virt` machine tops
// out at EL1 (EL2 when `virtualization=on`); the Pi firmware enters at
// EL2. This stub handles both: if entered at EL2 it configures EL1 to run
// AArch64, grants EL1/EL0 the physical counter/timer, zeroes the virtual
// counter offset, and `eret`s to EL1; if already at EL1 it proceeds
// directly. It then establishes a stack, zeroes `.bss` so Rust statics
// start cleared, and tail-calls the Rust entry with the DTB pointer
// preserved in x0.
//
// Secondary-CPU parking: QEMU `virt` holds secondaries in firmware until
// a PSCI `CPU_ON`, so only the boot CPU reaches `_start`. The Pi 4
// firmware (with no `armstub` spin-table) instead releases all four
// cores straight to the kernel entry. To behave correctly on both, every
// CPU whose `MPIDR_EL1` affinity is non-zero parks in a low-power `wfe`
// loop here, before touching the single boot stack or `.bss`, polling
// the kernel spin-table release word (`smp::SECONDARY_KERNEL_RELEASE`):
// it stays parked while the word is zero and branches to the address
// written there when the SMP bring-up (`plans/PI.md` P5) releases it
// deliberately (`smp::start_secondary_spintable`). The release word is
// *shared*, so one `sev` wakes every parked core; a second word,
// `SECONDARY_KERNEL_RELEASE_TARGET`, names the single core being brought
// up now, and a woken core proceeds only when that target equals its own
// affinity — the rest re-park. Bring-up is therefore strictly one core
// at a time (never a concurrent MMU-adopt / GIC-init race). This fails
// closed (never race the secondaries onto a shared
// stack): nothing is released until the boot CPU has published the
// secondary stacks, entry, and affinity table.
//
// SAFETY-INVARIANTs:
//   1. The body below `_start` runs exactly once, on the boot CPU
//      (affinity 0); every other CPU is trapped in the `wfe` park above
//      it. Interrupts are masked before any handler exists.
//   2. x0 carries the DTB pointer described above; it is preserved across
//      the EL2->EL1 drop in callee-saved x19 and restored before the call.
//   3. `.Lin_el1` writes the known MMU-off `SCTLR_EL1`
//      (`paging::SCTLR_MMU_OFF`) before the first EL1 data access, so the
//      architecturally UNKNOWN EL1 reset state (EE, WXN, A, SA, …) never
//      governs an access on either entry path. Likewise the EL2 path
//      writes every EL2 control register *whole* with its known hand-off
//      value (`el2::HCR_EL2_HANDOFF` and friends, unit-test-pinned) —
//      the Pi firmware stub leaves HCR_EL2/CNTHCTL_EL2/CPTR_EL2/MDCR_EL2
//      at their UNKNOWN reset values, and an UNKNOWN HCR_EL2.TVM traps
//      EL1's first MAIR/TCR/TTBR/SCTLR write into vector-less EL2 — a
//      silent hang at the MMU switch on real silicon (QEMU resets these
//      registers benignly, masking the residue).
//   4. The stack top and `.bss` bounds come from the active linker script
//      (`aarch64-virt.ld` / `aarch64-rpi4.ld`); `__bss_start`/`__bss_end`
//      are 16-byte aligned so the `stp` clear loop is exact.
//   5. `tairix_arch_aarch64_main` is `-> !` and never returns; the trailing
//      `wfi` park is unreachable under QEMU but is the correct conservative
//      behaviour on bare metal.
