//! EL1 exception handling: vector-table install, IRQ dispatch, and the
//! synchronous-fault path.
//!
//! The assembly vector table (`vectors.s`, included via `global_asm!` in
//! `lib.rs`) tags every exception with a numeric *kind* and calls
//! `tairix_aarch64_trap_handler`. This module:
//!
//! * `init_vectors` points `VBAR_EL1` at the table.
//! * `enable_irq` unmasks IRQs at the PE (`DAIF.I`), the aarch64
//!   analogue of riscv64's `sstatus.SIE` enable — kept separate from
//!   arming the timer so the caller controls exactly when ticks begin.
//! * `tairix_aarch64_trap_handler` dispatches an IRQ to the GIC
//!   acknowledge → timer/SGI → end-of-interrupt handshake, routes an EL0
//!   `svc` (lower-EL synchronous exception) to the installed
//!   [`crate::syscall_entry`] dispatch callback, redirects a same-EL
//!   data abort taken inside the guarded user-copy fault window
//!   ([`crate::uaccess`]) to the copy's fix-up (the frame's ELR slot is
//!   rewritten, so the copy returns an error instead of the CPU
//!   halting), and routes any other synchronous exception to the
//!   installed [`crate::fault`] handler, or with none installed to the
//!   port's own report, parking the CPU either way.
//!
//! # EL0 `svc` syscall dispatch
//!
//! The trampoline (`vectors.s`) passes the saved register frame to the
//! handler; on a lower-EL synchronous `svc` the handler marshals the
//! saved `x0`–`x5`/`x8` into the architecture-neutral
//! `[u64; SYSCALL_MAX_ARGS]` layout (via
//! [`crate::syscall_entry::syscall_frame_from_saved`]), forwards them to
//! the installed dispatch callback, and writes the result back into the
//! saved `x0` slot so the `eret` returns it to EL0. This is the aarch64
//! analogue of riscv64's `ecall` dispatch; the architecture-neutral
//! validation / capability / audit dispatcher lives in `kernel/syscall`,
//! never re-implemented here.
//!
//! The handler and the CSR writes are freestanding-only; the exception
//! *kind* constants and their classification build on the host so their
//! unit tests run under `cargo test`.
