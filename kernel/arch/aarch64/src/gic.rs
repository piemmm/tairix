//! GICv2 (ARM Generic Interrupt Controller) driver, with the
//! distributor / CPU-interface MMIO bases **discovered from the device
//! tree** (`plans/PI.md` P3).
//!
//! The aarch64 port boots on two boards whose GICv2 lives at different
//! addresses: the QEMU `virt` board ([`DEFAULT_GICD_BASE`] /
//! [`DEFAULT_GICC_BASE`]) and the Raspberry Pi 4's GIC-400
//! (`0xFF84_1000` / `0xFF84_2000`). Per the
//! difference is **discovered device-tree data**, never a `cfg(board)`
//! fork: this module holds the runtime base pair (an atomic, default =
//! the `virt` GICv2) the freestanding MMIO accessor reads, plus the
//! [`find_gic`] / [`configure_from_fdt`] discovery the boot path runs
//! over the firmware tree. The register layout is identical across the
//! two (GIC-400 *is* a GICv2), so there is one driver, two discovered
//! bases.
//!
//! This module owns the minimum surface the aarch64
//! Stage-3 primitives need:
//!
//! * `init` — enable the distributor and this CPU's interface, open the
//!   priority mask, and route interrupts to the IRQ exception.
//! * `enable_ppi` — enable one private-peripheral interrupt (the EL1
//!   physical-timer PPI, [`crate::preempt::TIMER_PPI`], is the one the
//!   timer path arms).
//! * `acknowledge` / `end_of_interrupt` — the IAR/EOIR handshake the
//!   IRQ handler runs per interrupt.
//! * `send_sgi` — raise a software-generated interrupt on a target CPU
//!   (the GICv2 mechanism behind [`crate::kernel_arch::Aarch64Arch`]'s
//!   `send_ipi`).
//!
//! # Interrupt-id classes (GICv2 spec §2.2.1)
//!
//! INTIDs `0..16` are SGIs (inter-processor), `16..32` are PPIs
//! (per-CPU peripherals — the timers live here), and `32..1020` are SPIs
//! (shared peripherals). Enabling and priority for SGIs/PPIs is
//! per-CPU through the banked first `GICD_ISENABLER` / `GICD_IPRIORITYR`
//! registers.
//!
//! # Host testability
//!
//! The register-offset math and the `GICD_SGIR` word encoding are pure
//! functions, unit-tested on the host; the MMIO reads/writes are gated
//! to the freestanding aarch64 target.
