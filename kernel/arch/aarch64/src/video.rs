//! Framebuffer boot console: kernel log output on the attached display.
//!
//! Boot (and later) console messages default to the **video display**;
//! the UART is the fallback when no display exists (the user-facing output is the screen, the serial line is a debug
//! last resort). On the Raspberry Pi the display pipeline is owned by
//! the `VideoCore` firmware, so this module asks it for a scan-out
//! surface over the shared mailbox property-channel client
//! (`tairix_vcmailbox`) and renders the kernel log into that surface
//! with the shared, architecture-neutral framebuffer text-console engine
//! (`tairix_fbcon` — one terminal definition across every arch port).
//!
//! Bring-up runs **before the MMU is enabled** (`configure_from_fdt`
//! is an early-returning, `ranges`-aware walk like the console/GIC
//! discoveries): with the data caches still off, the CPU↔firmware
//! property exchange is coherent by construction, so no cache
//! maintenance is needed during discovery. After the MMU and caches
//! come on, every framebuffer write is followed by a data-cache clean
//! to the point of coherency (`clean_dcache_range`) so the HVS
//! scan-out (which reads physical SDRAM) sees the rendered pixels.
//!
//! On QEMU's `virt` board there is no firmware mailbox; when the tree
//! instead carries a `qemu,fw-cfg-mmio` node **and** QEMU was started
//! with `-device ramfb`, the console programs the `ramfb` scan-out
//! (over the shared `tairix_fwcfg` client) to a statically-reserved
//! guest-RAM surface and renders into that — the same renderer, glyph
//! atlas, and publication discipline as the mailbox path, only the
//! surface source differs.
//!
//! Fail closed: no mailbox node and no ramfb device, a detached
//! display (`0×0` size), or any failed/malformed firmware answer
//! leaves the video console unconfigured and the UART keeps the
//! console (`crate::serial` routes through `write_bytes` only when
//! `is_active` reports a configured surface).
