//! AArch64 stage-1 page-table primitives for the memory-isolation test.
//!
//! This module is the aarch64 analogue of `kernel/arch/{x86_64,riscv64}::paging`.
//! It implements the Arch HAL page-table surface
//! ([`tairix_arch_api::mmu::AddressSpace`] +
//! [`tairix_arch_api::tlb::TlbShootdown`]) `kernel/mem` drives: it
//! supplies the architectural mechanism the memory-isolation QEMU
//! vertical needs — two stage-1 translation hierarchies that disagree
//! about a single virtual address, so the MMU faults a process that
//! reaches for another's frame ("memory isolation is
//! enforced by hardware").
//!
//! # Translation scheme
//!
//! 4 KiB granule, three levels (start at L1) covering a 39-bit VA, in
//! **two** regimes the architecture keeps disjoint: `TCR_EL1.T0SZ = 25`
//! gives `TTBR0_EL1` the low `[0, 2^39)` for user space, and
//! `TCR_EL1.T1SZ = 25` gives `TTBR1_EL1` the top `2^39` bytes for the
//! kernel. VA = `L1 (9) | L2 (9) | L3 (9) | offset (12)` in each. An L1
//! block descriptor maps 1 GiB, an L2 block 2 MiB, an L3 page 4 KiB (ARM
//! ARM D5.3).
//!
//! The kernel regime is one global root (`KERNEL_L1`) carrying the direct
//! physical map and the remap window, so a process root pays nothing for
//! either and no user address can name them — a switch between user spaces
//! reprograms `TTBR0_EL1` alone.
//!
//! Descriptor low bits (ARM ARM D5.3.1): a *table* or *page* descriptor
//! is `0b11`, a *block* descriptor is `0b01`. The lower attributes carry
//! the `MAIR_EL1` attribute index, access permission, shareability, and
//! the access flag.
//!
//! The bit-twiddling that encodes an output address into a descriptor,
//! extracts the per-level table index from a VA, and assembles the
//! attribute words is pure arithmetic and is host-unit-tested below; the
//! `&mut`-recovering table walk and the `TTBR0_EL1`/`SCTLR_EL1` write are
//! gated to the freestanding aarch64 target.
