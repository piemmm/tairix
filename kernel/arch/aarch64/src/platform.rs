//! aarch64 early-boot platform discovery.
//!
//! Implements the Arch HAL
//! [`PlatformDiscovery`](tairix_arch_api::PlatformDiscovery) slice over the
//! shared device-tree walk ([`tairix_arch_api::fdtwalk`]), which normalises
//! the flattened device tree the firmware hands the kernel into
//! [`tairix_abi::hwtree`] nodes generically — no per-device list to grow
//! (`PLAN.md` Stage 4.HW).
//!
//! What is genuinely this port's, and so lives here:
//!
//! * **the GIC interrupt specifier.** Both supported boards (QEMU `virt`,
//!   the Pi 4) describe interrupts with the three-cell `<type, number,
//!   flags>` form whose `number` is relative to its type, so the shared
//!   walk is handed the cell width and the type-relative INTID mapping
//!   ([`crate::fdt::gic_intid_from_cells`]);
//! * **the GIC's identity**, so a node wired to a second-level controller
//!   keeps none of its specifiers rather than having them read as the GIC's;
//! * **the board augmentation** the shared walk cannot know: the
//!   `VideoCore` mailbox's DMA property-buffer carve, the GENET MAC's DMA
//!   reach read from its parent bus, the EMMC2 SD host's translated DMA
//!   windows, the BCM2711 PCIe host bridge's
//!   inbound aperture and outbound window, and the Broadcom DMA binding's
//!   channel mask, which counts channels across the whole DMA block;
//! * **`pcie_bringup`**, the pre-MMU read of those PCIe windows the
//!   in-kernel USB bring-up needs before any hardware tree exists.
//!
//! The PSCI conduit the tree also carries ([`crate::fdt::psci_method`]) is
//! the prerequisite the aarch64 SMP bring-up (Stage W6) consumes; it is a
//! firmware-call property rather than a device node, so it is exposed
//! through the reader, not as a tree node.
