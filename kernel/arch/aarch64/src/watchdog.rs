//! aarch64 lockup-watchdog cadence timer and cross-CPU recovery.
//!
//! The aarch64 port of the Arch HAL watchdog surface
//! ([`tairix_arch_api::watchdog`]). It drives the architecture-neutral
//! detector in `kernel/core` with a periodic *liveness sample* and raises
//! the cross-CPU recovery signal a detected lockup asks for.
//!
//! # The cadence sample
//!
//! Hard-lockup detection needs a heartbeat that *stops* when a CPU stops
//! taking interrupts, sampled often enough that a multi-second threshold
//! has margin. This module arms the EL1 **virtual** generic timer
//! (`CNTV_*_EL0`, GIC PPI `WATCHDOG_PPI`) as a ~1 Hz one-shot on every
//! online CPU — a channel independent of the physical-timer one-shot the
//! tickless preemption path owns (`crate::preempt`), so the two never
//! interfere. It is programmed through the *relative* down-counter
//! `CNTV_TVAL_EL0`, so it needs no absolute virtual-count offset
//! (`CNTVOFF_EL2`, UNKNOWN at boot) — only "fire this many ticks from
//! now".
//!
//! The sample is delivered as an ordinary **IRQ**, and hard-lockup detection
//! is the cross-CPU *buddy* kind: a CPU that stops taking its watchdog IRQ is
//! observed by another that still takes its own. That is complete wherever
//! Group 0 (FIQ) is the Secure world's, as on a Pi 4's GIC-400. The debug
//! image adds a FIQ self-sample where a boot probe proves Group 0 reaches
//! this kernel, a GICv2 or GICv3 with one Security state
//! ([`crate::watchdog::fiq_support_from_probe`]).
//!
//! The interrupt is dispatched by [`crate::exceptions`]' IRQ path, which
//! recognises `WATCHDOG_PPI`, calls `on_watchdog_interrupt` (re-arm +
//! invoke the installed callback), and runs the GIC end-of-interrupt
//! handshake. The installed callback (a bin-supplied `extern "C"
//! fn(CpuId)`, the layering-clean analogue of the timer callback) reads
//! the interrupted `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1` through `read_elr_el1` /
//! `read_spsr_el1`, builds the neutral sample, and forwards it to
//! `kernel/core`'s `on_watchdog_tick`.
//!
//! # Recovery
//!
//! `Watchdog` implements [`tairix_arch_api::WatchdogArch`]: a soft
//! lockup is met with a reschedule IPI (the reschedule SGI
//! [`crate::preempt::IPI_SGI`]) so the offending CPU re-enters the
//! scheduler; a hard lockup is met with the same directed SGI as a
//! best-effort attention signal — a CPU that can still take an IRQ
//! recovers, and one that genuinely cannot is left for the loud report
//! the detector already emitted (honest, never a silent no-op).

// added beside it to observe a core wedged in a `DAIF.I`-masked section the
// maskable IRQ cadence cannot see (the D13 `stress --cpu N` class,
// `plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md`). Whether Group 0 / FIQ actually reaches the
// non-secure kernel is platform/firmware-owned — deliverable on a
// single-Security-state GIC (measured: QEMU `virt` with `secure=off`, the
// board default), secure on a two-Security-state GIC (QEMU `virt,secure=on`
// or a real Pi 4 GIC-400, where Group 0 belongs to the secure world) — so
// it is decided by an *empirical, fail-closed* boot probe and reported
// through the Arch-HAL capability honesty vocabulary
// (`plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md`). The watchdog is a consumer that
// chooses the FIQ cadence over the buddy detector from it.

/// Map the empirical FIQ-deliverability probe's outcome to the Arch-HAL
/// capability vocabulary. `delivered` is whether an FIQ was actually taken
/// in the deliberately `DAIF.I`-masked probe window.
