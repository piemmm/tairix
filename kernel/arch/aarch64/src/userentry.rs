//! aarch64 implementation of the Arch HAL "enter user mode" surface
//! ([`tairix_arch_api::EnterUser`]).
//!
//! Dropping a freshly built process image into EL0 is the `eret`
//! sequence: mask the asynchronous exceptions, program `SP_EL0` with the
//! user stack pointer, `TPIDR_EL0` with the thread pointer, `ELR_EL1`
//! with the entry point, and `SPSR_EL1` to
//! "EL0t with IRQ unmasked" (so EL0 runs **preemptible** — a
//! generic-timer interrupt taken in user mode drives the P-1 preemptive
//! reschedule, `plans/PI.md` D2b-2b-A P-1), set the first-argument
//! register `x0`, then `eret` — a context-synchronising EL1→EL0
//! transition. This is the one definition of that sequence; the CC2/CC3
//! QEMU verticals reach it through the HAL rather than copying the
//! `asm!` block.
//!
//! # The thread pointer
//!
//! `TPIDR_EL0` is seeded here and thereafter framed by `vectors.s` on every
//! trap, so it is genuinely per-thread and an EL0 write to it is respected
//! (`plans/THREADS.md` decision 7). Seeding it at entry also keeps a freshly
//! entered thread from inheriting whatever the previous occupant of this CPU
//! left in the register.
//!
//! [`crate::userentry::el0_spsr`] is that `SPSR`, and a debug image whose
//! watchdog cadence is delivered as a non-maskable FIQ additionally leaves
//! `DAIF.F` clear so the cadence can sample a core *while it runs user code*
//! (`plans/WATCHDOG.md`).
//! Every later return to EL0 restores the `SPSR` this entry established, from
//! the frame `vectors.s` saved, so this is the single place the EL0 mask state
//! is decided.
