//! [`Aarch64Arch`] — the aarch64 implementation of the Arch HAL
//! ([`tairix_arch_api::SchedulerArch`]).
//!
//! Like x86_64 and riscv64, the aarch64 port is a pure Arch HAL
//! implementation: it implements [`SchedulerArch`]
//! and exposes the monotonic clock and a CPU-park primitive, but it does
//! **not** name `kernel/core` or implement its `KernelArch` super-trait.
//! The downstream boot consumer wraps [`Aarch64Arch`] in a local
//! `KernelArch` type (orphan rules) and hands it to
//! `kernel_core::kernel_main`.
//!
//! # Clock
//!
//! The monotonic clock reads the architectural physical counter
//! `CNTPCT_EL0`; [`Aarch64Arch::monotonic_ns`] converts those ticks to
//! nanoseconds using the counter frequency `CNTFRQ_EL0` reports (passed
//! to the constructor), so the conversion factor and the tick source
//! share one frequency (no parallel measurement).
//!
//! # Inter-processor interrupts
//!
//! [`SchedulerArch::send_ipi`] raises a GICv2 software-generated
//! interrupt (SGI) on the target CPU through [`crate::gic`]. Sending to
//! the calling CPU is permitted (a self-reschedule). The boot/timer
//! slice runs a single CPU; the host build records the request in an
//! in-memory ledger so unit tests can assert preemption was requested.
//!
//! # Host testability
//!
//! The struct and its trait wiring build on the host so the unit tests
//! run under `cargo test`. The instruction-level primitives are gated:
//! the aarch64 build reads `CNTPCT_EL0` and parks on `wfi`, and the host
//! build substitutes a monotonic atomic counter *solely* so the host
//! tests can exercise the ns conversion (no fake
//! primitives in production).
