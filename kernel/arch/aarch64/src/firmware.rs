//! The pre-MMU `VideoCore` firmware channel, and the boot-time requests the
//! kernel makes over it.
//!
//! On a Raspberry Pi several things the kernel needs before it has drivers
//! belong to the firmware rather than to any register the ARM cores can
//! reach: the scan-out surface the boot console renders into, and the rate
//! the ARM cores run at. Both are property exchanges over the same mailbox
//! doorbell, so the doorbell, the DMA-visible property buffer, and the
//! transport built over them live here once and every early consumer borrows
//! them (`with_transport`).
//!
//! Each exchange is split into a pure half that takes a transport
//! (`raise_over`) and a wrapper that builds one, so the protocol sequence is
//! host-testable against the mock firmware — QEMU models no `VideoCore`, so
//! that is the only way to prove it before it runs on metal.
//!
//! # Boot CPU, before the MMU
//!
//! Every exchange here runs from the boot CPU before `enable_mmu_and_vectors`:
//! with the data caches still off the CPU↔firmware exchange is coherent by
//! construction, so no cache maintenance is needed, and there is no other
//! thread to serialise against. That is also why the property buffer is a
//! plain cell rather than a lock — an atomic read-modify-write on MMU-off
//! Device-typed memory is architecturally UNPREDICTABLE, the constraint that
//! orders the whole aarch64 boot (`plans/PI.md` P6c-2).
//!
//! Nothing here runs again. The kernel's one later exchange is the storage
//! floor's: the SD-card bring-up asks for the EMMC2 clock and drives the card's
//! supplies (`sd_supply`), before the user-space `vcmailbox` service can load
//! from the card it brings up. From then on that service alone owns the
//! doorbell.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! A board whose tree carries no mailbox (QEMU `virt`), a doorbell window
//! shorter than the register block, an unreachable firmware, or a malformed
//! answer all yield `None`. The console then keeps the UART and the clock
//! keeps whatever rate the firmware had chosen; nothing is guessed at.
