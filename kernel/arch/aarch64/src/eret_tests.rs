//! Host unit tests for the atomicity of this port's two `eret` sequences.
//!
//! `ELR_EL1` and `SPSR_EL1` are single-copy registers holding the state an
//! `eret` consumes. An exception taken once they hold that state overwrites
//! both in hardware, and the nested handler's own return restores *its*
//! saved pair — so the interrupted sequence then `eret`s to the nested
//! handler's return address in the nested handler's PSTATE. In the trap
//! trampoline that resumes the epilogue at EL1 with the frame already
//! popped, walking `sp` one frame per turn off the kernel stack until the
//! loads fault, and then faulting recursively with `DAIF` masked: a silent,
//! unrecoverable wedge reported as a bare hard lockup. The debug watchdog's
//! Group-0/FIQ cadence is a live source of exactly that exception, because
//! the syscall/fault handler runs with `DAIF.F` clear so a wedged core can
//! be sampled (`plans/WATCHDOG.md`).
//!
//! Both sequences therefore mask every asynchronous exception before they
//! program the return state. Neither can be executed on the host, and the
//! window is a race no target test can reliably enter, so the ordering is
//! pinned here against the two sources — the assembly carve-out
//! `vectors.s` and the inline-`asm!` user entry. The needles live in this
//! file rather than in the inspected ones, so a needle can never match
//! itself and pass a test whose subject has lost its mask.
