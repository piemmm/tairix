//! riscv64 Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) register driver.
//!
//! Stage 4.D Item 4 (riscv64 external-IRQ controller). On the QEMU
//! `virt` board — and on every SiFive-derived platform TAIRiX targets
//! — external interrupts from `virtio-mmio` transports (and any other
//! wired peripheral) are routed through a single PLIC. The PLIC is the
//! riscv64 analogue of the x86_64 IO-APIC: it owns per-source priority,
//! per-context enable bitmaps, a per-context priority threshold, and a
//! per-context claim/complete register pair.
//!
//! This module abstracts the PLIC's memory-mapped 32-bit registers
//! behind the [`PlicMmio`] trait so the whole control flow is exercised
//! by host-side unit tests against an in-memory mock; the bare-metal
//! `VolatilePlicMmio` is compiled only on `target_os = "none"` (so it
//! is plain text on host doc builds).
//!
//! # Mask-before-wake
//!
//! The architecture-neutral IRQ table (`kernel/irq`) requires a
//! controller's `mask` to complete (and be globally observable)
//! *before* a fire it reports reaches a waiter
//! (`docs/src/security/irq.md`). [`PlicController::mask`] honours the
//! contract by writing the masked source's **priority register to
//! zero** — a single 32-bit MMIO write, after which a source can never
//! out-prioritise the context threshold and so cannot re-fire — and
//! then emitting a [`core::sync::atomic::fence`] with
//! [`Ordering::SeqCst`]. The priority-write masking strategy is
//! deliberately lock-free: it is a single store to a per-source
//! register, so it needs no read-modify-write and races neither the
//! trap handler's claim/complete nor a concurrent arm/unmask on a
//! different source (no hacks,
//! interrupt-reentrancy-safe by design).
//!
//! # Arch HAL boundary
//!
//! This crate is a pure Arch HAL implementation and does **not** name
//! `kernel/irq`. [`PlicController`] exposes an inherent
//! [`PlicController::mask`]; the downstream boot consumer wraps it in a
//! local newtype that implements `kernel/irq`'s `IrqController` (orphan
//! rules), keeping the `kernel/irq` dependency out of the arch port.
//!
//! # Hart contexts
//!
//! The PLIC exposes one interrupt *context* per (hart, privilege)
//! pair. On the `virt` board the contexts are laid out
//! `M(hart0), S(hart0), M(hart1), S(hart1), …`, so hart `h`'s
//! supervisor context is `2 * h + 1` ([`s_mode_context`]). The
//! boot-to-`BootCompleted` slice is single-hart, so the controller is
//! built for the boot hart's S-mode context; SMP bring-up extends the
//! context set with the rest of the harts.
