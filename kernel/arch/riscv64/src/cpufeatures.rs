//! riscv64 CPU feature detection and cycle counter.
//!
//! Implements the Arch HAL
//! [`CpuFeatures`](tairix_arch_api::CpuFeatures) and
//! [`CpuCycles`](tairix_arch_api::CpuCycles) surfaces for riscv64.
//!
//! RISC-V advertises its extensions to a kernel running in **S-mode**
//! through the device-tree `riscv,isa` string only: the base ISA and the
//! single-letter standard extensions (including the `V` vector extension)
//! and the multi-letter extensions (`Zbb`, `Zbc`, `Zbkc`, …) all appear
//! there. The `misa` CSR reports the same base/single-letter set, but it
//! is a **Machine-mode** CSR (address `0x301`): a `csrr misa` executed in
//! S-mode raises an illegal-instruction exception, so this port never
//! reads it (this is exactly how Linux discovers riscv extensions —
//! from the device tree, not `misa`). The handle carries the set parsed
//! from the ISA string the platform-discovery pass reads via
//! [`tairix_fdt`].
//!
//! The cycle counter is the architectural `time` CSR (`rdtime`) — a
//! fixed-rate, monotonically-increasing counter always available to
//! S-mode on the QEMU `virt` platform. Like the aarch64 `CNTVCT_EL0`
//! choice it is a wall-time proxy the `lib/cpuops` harness measures
//! deltas over, which is sufficient to rank two equally-correct
//! routines and needs no `rdcycle` counter-enable wiring.
//!
//! Only the architecture port parses the ISA string, so detection lives
//! here. The decoder (`features_from_isa_string`) is pure and host-tested.
