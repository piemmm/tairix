//! riscv64 implementation of the Arch HAL "enter user mode" surface
//! ([`tairix_arch_api::EnterUser`]).
//!
//! Dropping a freshly built process image into U-mode is the `sret`
//! sequence: set `sstatus.SUM` (so the S-mode trap handler that runs after
//! the program's `ecall` may touch the U-bit user stack), clear
//! `sstatus.SPP`/`SPIE` (so `sret` targets U-mode with `sstatus.SIE == 0`
//! there) and `sstatus.SIE` (so no S-mode interrupt can be taken across the
//! rest of the sequence — the `sscratch` arm below depends on it), lay this
//! task's **trap anchor** just below the kernel stack pointer and arm
//! `sscratch` with it, load `sepc` with the entry point and `sp`/`a0` with
//! the stack pointer and first argument, hand U-mode a zeroed thread
//! pointer, then `sret`. This is the one definition of that sequence; the
//! CC2/CC3 QEMU verticals reach it through the HAL rather than copying the
//! `asm!` block.
//!
//! # The trap anchor and `tp`
//!
//! `sscratch` points at a [`crate::trap::TRAP_ANCHOR_BYTES`]-wide kernel-only
//! region whose first word carries the kernel `tp` — this port's per-hart
//! identity anchor ([`crate::smp::current_hartid`]) — so the trap vector can
//! restore it the instant a U-mode trap arrives. `tp` is also the RISC-V psABI
//! thread pointer, which U-mode code writes freely; without the anchor the
//! kernel would resolve its per-CPU state from whatever value the trapping
//! task last put there. The entry sequence therefore publishes the running
//! hart's `tp` into the anchor (it is still live in `tp` at that point) and
//! then **zeroes** `tp` for U-mode, so the entered task neither inherits nor
//! can observe the kernel's hart identity.
//!
//! # U-mode preemptibility
//!
//! Clearing `SPIE` does **not** make U-mode uninterruptible. A
//! supervisor interrupt is taken whenever the hart runs at a privilege
//! *below* S-mode (the privileged-spec rule: priv `U` < `S`), regardless
//! of `sstatus.SIE`; `SIE`/`SPIE` only gate interrupts taken *in S-mode*.
//! So once the boot path arms the supervisor timer (`sie.STIE` +
//! `crate::preempt::init_local_preempt`), a runaway U-mode task is
//! involuntarily preempted by the timer trap — the riscv64 analogue of
//! aarch64's preemptible-EL0 `SPSR` (`plans/PI.md` D2b-2b-A P-1b).
//! Leaving `SIE` clear keeps the *kernel* non-preemptible: a tick taken while in S-mode never fires the preempt point
//! (`crate::trap` gates it on the saved `SPP`).
