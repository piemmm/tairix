//! Host unit tests for the ordering of this port's two `sret` sequences.
//!
//! `sscratch` is the trap vector's *only* discriminator between a trap from
//! U-mode and one from S-mode: a non-zero swap-in result means "from U". An
//! S-mode interrupt taken while `sscratch` is armed is therefore misread as
//! a U-mode trap — it builds its frame at the armed stack top, clobbering
//! the interrupted frame, and returns down the S path, which does not
//! re-arm. `sscratch` is then 0 while a task runs in U-mode, so every later
//! trap of that task builds the kernel's frame on the task's own *user*
//! stack: silent corruption, ending in a wild jump that once parked the
//! hart. Both sequences therefore mask S-mode interrupts *before* they arm
//! `sscratch`.
//!
//! Neither sequence can be executed on the host, and the window is a race
//! no target test can reliably enter, so the ordering is pinned here
//! against the two sources — the assembly carve-out `trap.s` and the
//! inline-`asm!` user entry. The needles live in this file rather than in
//! the inspected ones, so a needle can never match itself and pass a test
//! whose subject has lost its mask.

/// Byte offset of the sole occurrence of `needle` in `src`.
///
/// Requiring exactly one occurrence is what makes an ordering assertion
/// meaningful: a second copy of a pinned instruction would leave the order
/// it is compared in ambiguous. The trap path's other source pins share it.
