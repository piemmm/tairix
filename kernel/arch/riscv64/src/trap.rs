//! riscv64 S-mode trap vector and external-interrupt dispatch seam.
//!
//! Stage 4.D Item 4 (riscv64 external-IRQ trap glue). This module owns
//! the architecture-specific surface for taking a supervisor-mode trap
//! on the QEMU `virt` board:
//!
//! * The `stvec` trap vector (`tairix_riscv64_trap_vector`, published
//!   by the `global_asm!` block below) that saves the interrupted
//!   context's caller-saved registers, calls the Rust handler, restores,
//!   and `sret`s.
//! * `init_traps`, which points `stvec` at that vector (direct mode)
//!   and enables supervisor external interrupts (`sie.SEIE`) plus the
//!   supervisor global interrupt-enable (`sstatus.SIE`).
//! * The one-shot-published dispatch callback ([`set_trap_dispatch`])
//!   the Rust handler invokes on a supervisor *external* interrupt. The
//!   callback is responsible for claiming the pending source from the
//!   [`crate::plic::PlicController`], forwarding it to
//!   `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::fire` (which masks the source before
//!   the waiter observes `ready`), and completing the claim.
//!
//! # Mask-before-wake
//!
//! Like the x86_64 dispatcher, the Rust handler here does **not** mask
//! the line itself — it forwards to the installed dispatcher, which
//! calls `IrqTable::fire`, which in turn calls the
//! [`crate::plic::PlicController`]'s `mask` *before* setting `ready`
//! (`docs/src/security/irq.md`). The PLIC claim/complete handshake
//! belongs to the dispatcher because only it holds the controller
//! reference.
//!
//! # No global mutable state
//!
//! The dispatch slot is set-once at boot, backed by an atomic so the
//! trap path reads it without a lock; a second publish fails closed.
//!
//! (`tairix_riscv64_trap_vector`, `init_traps`, and the Rust handler are
//! gated to the freestanding riscv64 target, so they are plain text on
//! host doc builds; the dispatch slot and `scause` decode build on the
//! host so their unit tests run under `cargo test`.)
