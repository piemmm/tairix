# TAIRiX riscv64 S-mode trap vector for the QEMU `virt` board.
#
# Installed into `stvec` (direct mode) by `trap::init_traps`. Every
# S-mode trap — synchronous exception or interrupt — enters here with
# `sstatus.SIE` cleared by hardware. The vector swaps to a kernel stack,
# saves the interrupted context's caller-saved integer registers plus the
# return-state CSRs (`sepc`, `sstatus`, and the interrupted `sp`), calls
# the Rust handler (`tairix_riscv64_trap_handler`, which preserves
# callee-saved registers per the C ABI and may advance the saved `sepc`),
# restores, and returns with `sret`.
#
# # Per-task trap anchor via `sscratch`
#
# A trap taken from U-mode must NOT run the handler on the interrupted
# user `sp`: a cooperative `ContextSwitch::switch` taken mid-handler
# (a parking `yield`/`wait`) would otherwise persist the *user* stack
# pointer as the task's saved kernel context. So the vector swaps `sp`
# with `sscratch` on entry. The invariant the rest of the port upholds is:
#
#   * while running U-mode code, `sscratch` holds the address of the
#     running task's **trap anchor**: a TRAP_ANCHOR_BYTES-wide, kernel-only
#     region at the top of the task's kernel-stack window whose first word
#     (OFF_ANCHOR_KTP) is the kernel `tp` of the hart the task is running
#     on. The trap frame is built immediately below it. Armed by
#     `userentry::enter_user` before the first `sret`, and re-armed by this
#     vector's U-return path;
#   * while running S-mode code, `sscratch` holds 0 (set by `init_traps`
#     at boot and by this vector on every U->S entry).
#
# The entry swap therefore distinguishes the two trap directions: a trap
# from U-mode lands a non-zero anchor address in `sp`, while a nested
# trap from S-mode (a timer/IPI taken while running kernel code) lands 0
# and is recovered onto the interrupted kernel `sp`. The return path
# restores `sscratch` per `sstatus.SPP`: returning to U re-arms it with
# this task's anchor; returning to S leaves it 0.
#
# # Why the anchor carries the kernel `tp`
#
# `tp` (x4) is this port's per-hart anchor — `smp::current_hartid` and the
# Arch-HAL per-CPU slice read the running hart's identity out of it — and it
# is also an ordinary *unprivileged* register U-mode code may write at will
# (it is the RISC-V psABI thread pointer). A vector that left `tp` alone
# would therefore hand the kernel a caller-chosen CPU identity on every
# `ecall`: a task could name another hart and steer the kernel onto that
# core's per-CPU state (its resume handle, dispatch slot, live address
# space), which is kernel memory corruption, not merely a wrong reading.
# So the from-U prologue spills the user's `tp` straight into the frame and
# reloads the kernel's from the anchor *before* any other register is
# touched and long before the Rust handler runs; the U-return path restores
# the user's value, so U-mode keeps its own thread pointer across every
# trap and every context switch (the frame lives on that task's own kernel
# stack). The anchor is written only by code already running on the hart it
# names, so a migrated task always re-enters U-mode under the correct id.
#
# # `sepc`/`sstatus`/`sp` are frame-resident
#
# Saving the three return-state values into the per-trap frame makes each
# exception's resume self-contained across a cooperative context switch:
# a task parked mid-handler resumes at its own `sepc`/`sstatus`/user `sp`,
# not whatever the live CSRs hold after another task ran (the riscv64
# sibling of the aarch64 `ELR_EL1`/`SPSR_EL1`/`SP_EL0` errata fix).
#
# SAFETY-INVARIANTs:
#   1. `.align 2` keeps the vector 4-byte aligned so `stvec` direct mode
#      (mode bits = 0) addresses it correctly.
#   2. The frame is 16-byte aligned (256 bytes) per the riscv64 ABI; the
#      `offset_of!` asserts in `syscall_entry_tests.rs` pin every field
#      offset against the stores/loads below, and the `.equ` values here
#      are parsed and compared against their Rust counterparts by the
#      `trap_layout_tests.rs` pinning tests, so neither side can drift.
#   3. Wherever `sscratch` is armed (non-zero), S-mode interrupts are
#      masked. The entry swap is the only from-U/from-S discriminator, so
#      an S-mode interrupt taken with `sscratch` armed is misread as a
#      U-mode trap: it builds its frame on the armed top, clobbering the
#      interrupted frame, and returns down the S path, which does not
#      re-arm — leaving the task running in U-mode with no kernel stack
#      armed. Both arming sites hold the line: the U-return below writes
#      the frame's saved `sstatus` (hardware cleared `SIE` on entry, so
#      the saved copy always has it clear) before its `csrw sscratch`, and
#      `userentry::enter_user` clears `SIE` before its own arm.
#      A syscall body *does* deliberately enable `SIE` mid-handler so a
#      long `ecall` cannot monopolise the hart; that is safe only because
#      `sscratch` is 0 for the whole handler, which is why the
#      `csrw sscratch, zero` below is not optional.
#   4. No instruction between the entry swap and the from-U reload of `tp`
#      reads `tp`, and nothing after that reload writes it before the
#      return path, so the kernel never observes a U-mode-supplied thread
#      pointer. The anchor is kernel-only memory (the task's own kernel
#      stack), so U-mode can neither read nor forge the kernel `tp` it
#      holds. `trap_layout_tests.rs` pins this ordering against this file.
