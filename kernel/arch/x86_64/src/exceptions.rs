//! x86_64 exception entries: one stub per architecturally-defined vector,
//! funnelled into a single fatal tail.
//!
//! `percpu::init` populates every IDT slot with the vector-agnostic
//! fail-closed thunk ([`crate::interrupts`]), which cannot say *which*
//! exception fired and cannot read the error code the CPU pushes for the
//! subset of vectors that push one. This module gives each vector its own
//! stub — the vector as an immediate, the hardware error code where the
//! CPU pushed one, a synthetic zero where it did not — so a kernel-mode
//! `#GP`, `#UD`, `#DF` or machine check reaches the installed
//! [`tairix_arch_api::fault::FaultHandlerFn`] and states its cause, instead of
//! parking mutely.
//!
//! It is the x86_64 counterpart of the aarch64
//! `exceptions::fatal_exception` / riscv64 `trap::fatal_exception` tails:
//! every unhandled exception funnels into `fatal_exception`, which
//! reports through the one fatal policy the boot path installs.
//!
//! # The vector table
//!
//! Intel SDM Vol 3A Table 6-1 defines vectors `0..=21`; `22..=31` are
//! reserved but architecturally still exceptions, so they get stubs too
//! (a delivery on one is a real fault, not something to ignore). The
//! vectors the CPU pushes a hardware error code for are `8`, `10`–`14`,
//! `17` and `21` (SDM Vol 3A §6.13).
//!
//! Vector 14 (`#PF`) is deliberately **absent**: a page fault is the one
//! exception this kernel can resolve — a demand-paged file mapping, or a
//! fault inside the guarded user-copy window — so it keeps its own
//! resumable entry in [`crate::fault`] and is installed separately by the
//! boot path.
//!
//! # Faults taken from ring 3
//!
//! A ring-3 exception a *user instruction raised* is the running task's
//! fault, not the CPU's, and costs only that task: the tail hands it to
//! the installed [`tairix_arch_api::fault::UserFaultTerminateFn`], which records the
//! crash exit, reclaims the task, and suspends it with an exit action — so
//! the CPU carries on running other work instead of parking for one
//! process's `ud2`.
//!
//! Not every vector is chargeable that way, and the table below declares
//! which, per vector. `#NMI` is an external interrupt rather than an
//! exception, `#DF` an abort whose saved state Intel documents as
//! unreliable, and `#MC` an imprecise machine-level abort: none is the
//! interrupted task's doing, and the first two are delivered on a shared
//! per-CPU IST stack a reschedule must never abandon. Those, the reserved
//! vectors, and every same-privilege (kernel) exception are the kernel's
//! own and keep the fatal report, whose syndrome still records the
//! originating ring honestly ([`crate::fault::syndrome_from_user`]).
