//! x86_64 external-IRQ trap glue (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.2).
//!
//! This module owns the architecture-specific surface for external
//! interrupts on x86_64:
//!
//! * The vector range reservation (`0x30..=0xFE`) and the per-vector
//!   asm thunk table published by `external_irq.s`.
//! * The lock-free [`Routing`] table mapping IDT vectors to
//!   architecture-neutral GSI line numbers.
//! * The Rust dispatcher invoked by the shared asm trampoline. The
//!   dispatcher looks up the GSI through [`Routing`], forwards to the
//!   architecture-neutral `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::fire` via a
//!   one-shot-published callback ([`set_external_irq_dispatch`]), and
//!   writes the LAPIC EOI register before returning.
//! * The MADT IO-APIC discovery helper `discover_io_apics` consumed
//!   by the kernel binary's boot pipeline.
//!
//! # Mask-before-wake invariant
//!
//! Per `docs/src/security/irq.md` ("Wait semantics"), the kernel
//! requires every controller to mask the line before signalling
//! `ready = true`. The Rust dispatcher in this module **does not**
//! perform the mask write itself — it calls
//! `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::fire`, which in turn invokes the
//! installed controller's `mask` *before* setting `ready`. The
//! production controller (`IoApicController` in
//! `kernel/tairix-kernel`) issues a volatile, fenced write to the
//! IO-APIC's redirection-entry mask bit. The
//! `mask_is_observed_before_wake` regression test in
//! `kernel/irq` and the `ioapic_controller_mask_before_wake`
//! kernel-binary host test pin the contract.
//!
//! # No global mutable state
//!
//! The [`Routing`] table and the dispatcher slot
//! ([`set_external_irq_dispatch`]) are set-once at boot. They are
//! backed by atomics so they can be read concurrently from every
//! CPU's trap path without taking a lock. Writers fail-closed on a
//! second publish (one-shot publish, no mutable
//! static).

///
/// Behaviour:
///   1. Truncates `vector` to `u8` and (if out of range) signals a
///      spurious delivery by writing EOI and returning — the IDT
///      should never route a non-external vector here, so the check
///      is belt-and-braces.
///   2. Calls the installed [`ExternalIrqDispatchFn`] with the
///      truncated vector. The dispatcher forwards to
///      `tairix_kernel_irq::IrqTable::fire`.
///   3. Writes `0` to the LAPIC EOI register releasing the
///      in-service bit (Intel SDM Vol 3A §11.8.5). EOI is performed
///      *after* the dispatcher because the dispatcher must observe
///      a consistent mask state through [`global_routing`] before
///      the next delivery on the same vector can stack.
///
/// The shared trampoline every per-vector stub in `external_irq.s` pushes its
/// vector and jumps to: save the GPRs and the SSE state, dispatch under the
/// kernel `MXCSR`, load a pending extended state on the way back to ring 3,
/// restore, drop the vector word, `iretq`.
///
/// On entry the vector word sits on the CPU frame, which leaves `%rsp`
/// 16-byte aligned, so after the fifteen GPRs a pad word re-aligns it for the
/// SSE frame and the `call`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Only the per-vector stubs may reach it, by `jmp`.
