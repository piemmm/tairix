//! x86_64 IDT builder and common ISR prologue (Stage 3a (c2)).
//!
//! This module owns the architecturally-fixed surface every interrupt
//! and exception delivery on x86_64 needs:
//!
//!   * [`InterruptStackFrame`] — the five 8-byte words the CPU itself
//!     pushes on every interrupt entry in long mode (Intel SDM Vol 3A
//!     §6.14.2 Figure 6-8): `rip`, `cs`, `rflags`, `rsp`, `ss`.
//!   * [`SavedRegs`] — the 15 general-purpose registers the common
//!     prologue persists *immediately* on top of the CPU-pushed frame
//!     so a Rust handler can inspect or mutate them through a
//!     `&mut SavedRegs`.
//!   * [`IdtEntry`] / [`Idt`] / `IdtPointer` — the descriptor table
//!     itself, addressed by `lidt`.
//!   * `Idt::load` — the bare-metal install routine (gated to
//!     `target_os = "none"`).
//!
//! # Common ISR prologue
//!
//! The assembly half lives in `interrupts.s` and exports the symbol
//! `tairix_arch_x86_64_isr_default`. Every IDT vector populated by
//! [`Idt::with_default_handler`] routes through this single thunk. On
//! entry the prologue:
//!
//!   1. Pushes `0` as a synthetic "error code" if the CPU did not push
//!      one (vectors that *do* push a hardware error code — 8, 10–14,
//!      17, 21 — would need a vector-specific stub; the default
//!      thunk treats every vector as no-error, which is correct for the
//!      Stage 3a (c1/c2/c3) scope because no IDT slot is wired to a
//!      hardware-error vector here. The Stage 3a (c5) preemption commit
//!      that wires real ISRs will extend `define_isr!` to emit
//!      vector-specific stubs.)
//!   2. Pushes the full 15-GPR [`SavedRegs`] block in the layout the
//!      `repr(C)` definition pins below.
//!   3. Loads `rdi` with a pointer to the saved-regs block and calls
//!      `tairix_arch_x86_64_default_interrupt`, which is `-> !` and
//!      therefore must terminate the kernel through `qemu_exit` or the
//!      equivalent platform-specific failure path.
//!
//! The "must terminate" property is intentional: the only consumers
//! of the default thunk today are *unexpected* interrupts that
//! the charter requires to fail closed. A real ISR (LAPIC timer,
//! syscall entry, etc.) lives behind its own dedicated thunk emitted
//! by the (c5) follow-up; it is *not* shoe-horned into the default
//! path. This avoids the anti-pattern of a "convenience wrapper"
//! that ends up carrying production logic.
