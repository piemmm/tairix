//! Application-processor (AP) bring-up — Stage 3a (b).
//!
//! The boot CPU drives the rest of the cores through the
//! INIT-SIPI-SIPI sequence documented in Intel SDM Vol 3A §8.4.4.1.
//! This module owns:
//!
//! * [`AP_TRAMPOLINE_PHYS`] / [`AP_TRAMPOLINE_LEN`] — the layout
//!   constants shared with `ap_trampoline.s` (cross-checked by the
//!   `ap_boot_slot_layout_is_locked` host unit test against
//!   `core::mem::offset_of!`).
//! * [`ApBootSlot`] — the per-AP record the trampoline reads at a fixed
//!   in-page offset.
//! * [`TrampolineFrame`] — the typed wrapper around the 4 KiB low
//!   physical frame; installs the payload and exposes a typed view of
//!   the boot slot.
//! * [`init_sipi_sipi`] — the INIT-deassert + INIT + SIPI + SIPI
//!   sequencer expressed against the existing
//!   [`crate::apic::Lapic`] / [`crate::apic::LapicMmio`] primitives so
//!   no new architecture-neutral surface is introduced.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `kernel/arch/x86_64` and not `kernel/sched`
//!
//! the charter forbids "convenience wrappers" that exist in only
//! one consumer. AP bring-up is x86_64-specific (aarch64 uses PSCI,
//! riscv64 uses HSM, wasm32 has no APs); the architecture-neutral
//! scheduler has no business knowing how a target hardware brings up
//! its CPUs. The cooperation point is [`crate::smp::ApBootSlot::entry`]
//! — a plain `extern "C" fn(cpu_id: u32) -> !` that the consumer-side
//! kernel binary supplies.
//!
//! # `unsafe` discipline
//!
//! Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` justification. The only
//! non-trivial one is the acquire load of the in-frame rendezvous flag
//! ([`TrampolineFrame::load_ready`]). The payload install and the
//! boot-slot write are plain slice copies; ordering against the SIPI
//! comes from the caller's release fence. Nothing about the trampoline
//! page leaks across the crate boundary as a raw pointer.

// `AtomicU32` is referenced by `TrampolineFrame::load_ready` for the
// acquire-load against the in-frame `ready` flag the AP `xchg`s into;
// the `ApBootSlot` struct itself only uses a plain `u32` so it can stay
// `Copy + Eq` (the asm-side `xchg` atomicity is what the wire protocol
// requires; the Rust-side struct never receives an AP write directly).
use core::mem::offset_of;
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicU32, Ordering};

// The caller-provided `ApStackPool` payload is held in an `UnsafeCell`
// so its `static` lands in writable memory; only the freestanding
// bring-up path materialises one.
