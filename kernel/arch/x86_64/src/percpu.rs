//! Per-CPU bring-up (Stage 3a (c1)).
//!
//! This module owns the *integration* between the
//! [`crate::gdt::PerCpuGdt`] primitives (already on `main`), the
//! [`crate::interrupts::Idt`] surface introduced in (c2), and the
//! actual physical IST stack arenas every CPU needs in order to field
//! a `#DF` or `#NMI` without trampling its task stack. Every CPU
//! invokes `init` exactly once with its CPU index; `init` selects
//! the per-CPU slot in the static `PerCpu` arena, populates the IST
//! stack tops, finalises the GDT, installs it, and loads the IDT.
//!
//! # Why caller-provided storage and not a fixed `.bss` arena?
//!
//! `kernel/arch/x86_64` is deliberately `alloc`-free: the freestanding
//! QEMU test binaries link it without an allocator and `tairix-kernel`
//! is *not* on the `alloc` heap before the per-CPU IDT is installed —
//! there is no allocator yet. A fixed `static mut PER_CPU: [PerCpu;
//! MAX_CPUS]` would therefore size the per-CPU arena to a hand-picked
//! compile-time constant that a larger machine outgrows and a smaller
//! one wastes — exactly the "no fixed capacity ceiling" defect.
//!
//! Instead the per-CPU arena is a caller-owned [`PerCpuStorage`]: the
//! constructing boot path sizes `N` for the machine's-discovered
//! logical-CPU count, places it in a `static` (allocator-free bins) or a
//! leaked allocation, and publishes it through
//! [`PerCpuStorage::register`] before the first `init`. The per-CPU
//! entry points then index the registered slices, bounds-checked against
//! the published length; before registration — or for an out-of-range
//! index — they fail closed with [`InitError::CpuIndexOutOfRange`]. This mirrors the aarch64
//! `smp::SecondaryStackPool` / riscv64 `smp::SecondaryStackPool`
//! caller-sized secondary-bring-up pools and the crate's own
//! `crate::kernel_arch::X86_64ArchStorage`.
//!
//! # Why one IDT per CPU?
//!
//! The IDT is a CPU-local register (IDTR). Sharing one IDT across
//! cores is technically fine — every entry is read-only after install —
//! but per-CPU storage is the more defensive arrangement: an IST
//! reference inside an IDT entry indirectly addresses *this* CPU's
//! TSS (via the GDT) so each core gets its own copy by symmetry, and
//! a future commit that wants per-CPU exception statistics can mutate
//! its own copy without atomics.
