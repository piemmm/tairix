//! This port's console: the 16550 UART at COM1 (I/O ports `0x3F8..=0x3FF`),
//! as the device half of the shared console-output engine.
//!
//! # What lives here and what does not
//!
//! Everything about *queueing* console output — whole-line framing, ordering,
//! shedding the least important line under pressure, counting and reporting
//! what was dropped, and the one bounded drain — is
//! [`tairix_conout`], shared by every port. What lives here is
//! only what the silicon makes specific to this architecture: the I/O-port
//! access, the line bring-up, and the status and interrupt-enable bits.
//!
//! # How output reaches the wire
//!
//! Unlike the interrupt-driven ports, this console drains **write-through**:
//! a producer's line is pushed to the device before the call returns, waiting
//! boundedly for the transmitter. That is deliberate, not a shortcut. This
//! port's UART interrupt is routed and unmasked only when the interactive
//! session starts, and the great majority of console output — the entire boot
//! log, and every panic — happens before that, with no interrupt able to drain
//! a backlog and no dispatch loop yet running to pump one. A queue that
//! deferred those bytes to an interrupt that cannot arrive would simply lose
//! the boot transcript.
//!
//! The queue is still what makes output *correct*: a line is admitted whole
//! under the console gate, so two CPUs logging at once can no longer interleave
//! their bytes mid-line, and anything that cannot be carried is counted and
//! reported rather than silently dropped.
//!
//! The wait is bounded. A transmitter that never reports itself ready — an
//! unwired or flow-blocked line — is declared wedged and its bytes dropped
//! (and counted), because an unbounded readiness spin would hang the kernel on
//! its very first log line.
