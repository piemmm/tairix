//! Page-table primitives for the Stage-2 memory-isolation test.
//!
//! The test in `tests/integration/memory_isolation` needs two
//! page-table hierarchies that disagree about a single virtual address:
//! a *victim* address space in which the address resolves to a known
//! frame, and an *attacker* address space in which it does not. The CPU
//! must fault the attacker on access. That is the architectural
//! guarantee ("Memory isolation is enforced by hardware")
//! requires — and the test verifies — *at the page-table layer*, before
//! any of the orchestration in `kernel/mem`'s `AddressSpace` is added.
//!
//! This module deliberately operates one level *below* `kernel/mem`:
//!
//! * It does not allocate from `lib/collections::FrameAllocator`. Instead
//!   it uses a tiny, in-`.bss` page-frame pool. The kernel-side trait
//!   plumbing is unrelated to the architectural property under test, and
//!   pulling it in would require Stage-3a's full physical-frame
//!   allocator (not in scope, see crate docs).
//! * It exposes only the operations the test needs: build a PML4 that
//!   identity-maps the first 32 MiB of physical memory, add an extra
//!   4 KiB mapping, switch CR3.
//!
//! It implements the Arch HAL page-table surface
//! ([`tairix_arch_api::mmu::AddressSpace`] +
//! [`tairix_arch_api::tlb::TlbShootdown`]) `kernel/mem` drives. The
//! page-table *walk* (`map_page` / `translate` / `unmap`) recovers each
//! level through the frame source that drew it, so it runs on the host
//! too; only [`AddressSpace::activate`]'s `CR3` load needs the metal,
//! and that is proven by the `memory_isolation` QEMU vertical. The bit
//! math is a strict subset so promotion does not require interface
//! creep.
