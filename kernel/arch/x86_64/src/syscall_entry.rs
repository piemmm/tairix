//! x86_64 `syscall`/`sysret` entry path (Stage 3a (c6)).
//!
//! This module owns the per-CPU machine state required to take a
//! user-space `syscall` instruction, marshal its register-passed
//! arguments into the architecture-neutral
//! `tairix_kernel_syscall::RawArgs` layout, and return to user space
//! via `sysretq`. The architecture-neutral dispatcher (validation,
//! capability checks, audit) is owned by `kernel/syscall` and is
//! re-used verbatim — this crate never duplicates the
//! `SYSCALL_TABLE_HASH` validation surface.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Three concerns are separated:
//!
//! 1. **Pure MSR-value math** ([`encode_star`], [`efer_with_sce`],
//!    [`fmask_value`], [`pack_raw_args`]). Host-testable, no
//!    architectural side effects.
//! 2. **Per-CPU state** — a fixed-size table of
//!    [`SyscallTls`] blocks (the kernel-stack top and a per-CPU save
//!    slot for the user `%rsp`). `IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE` on each CPU
//!    points at *that CPU's* slot, so the assembly entry path can
//!    swap stacks with two `gs:`-relative moves.
//! 3. **Bare-metal entry path** — the naked `syscall_entry_stub` and
//!    its Rust trampoline `tairix_arch_x86_64_syscall_dispatch`,
//!    both gated to `target_os = "none"`. The trampoline forwards
//!    the syscall to a binary-installed callback (mirroring the
//!    [`crate::preempt`] timer-callback design); the (c7) binary
//!    glue is the only writer of that callback and wires it to a
//!    real `tairix_kernel_syscall::Dispatcher`.
//!
//! # MSR programming
//!
//! `init_local_syscalls` writes five MSRs (Intel SDM Vol 3A §5.8.8,
//! §2.7):
//!
//! | MSR | Address | Purpose |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`IA32_EFER`] | `0xC000_0080` | Sets [`EFER_SCE`] (bit 0) to enable the `syscall`/`sysret` instructions. |
//! | [`IA32_STAR`] | `0xC000_0081` | Encodes the kernel CS/SS pair (entry) and the user CS/SS triplet (sysret). |
//! | [`IA32_LSTAR`] | `0xC000_0082` | Linear address of the syscall entry stub. |
//! | [`IA32_FMASK`] | `0xC000_0084` | Bits to clear in `RFLAGS` on entry (`IF`/`TF`/`DF`/`AC`/`NT`/`RF`/`VM`/`IOPL`). |
//! | [`IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE`] | `0xC000_0102` | Per-CPU [`SyscallTls`] address (swapped in by `swapgs`). |
//!
//! `STAR[47:32]` is loaded into `CS` on entry (and `STAR[47:32] + 8`
//! into `SS`). On 64-bit `sysret`, `STAR[63:48] + 16` is loaded into
//! `CS` and `STAR[63:48] + 8` into `SS` — so the user-CS field passed
//! to [`encode_star`] is the *base*, i.e. the compat-mode user CS
//! selector that sits 16 bytes below the 64-bit user CS in the GDT.
//! Callers that only have a "64-bit user CS" should subtract 16
//! before calling.
//!
//! # `RFLAGS` mask
//!
//! [`fmask_value`] clears `IF`, `TF`, `DF`, `AC`, `NT`, `RF`,
//! `VM`, and `IOPL`. The motivations are:
//!
//! * `IF` — entry must be interrupt-free until the kernel has swapped to
//!   its GS base and pivoted onto the kernel stack. The entry stub then
//!   issues a single `sti` in that well-defined kernel context so the
//!   *syscall body* runs with device interrupts deliverable (a long,
//!   non-blocking syscall must not monopolise the CPU with interrupts
//!   masked), and `cli`s again before restoring the user frame. The kernel
//!   stays non-preemptible: an interrupt taken at CPL=0 during the body
//!   only latches a reschedule (honoured at return-to-user), it never
//!   switches away mid-syscall.
//! * `TF` — drop a stray single-step before kernel code runs.
//! * `DF` — System V AMD64 ABI requires `DF=0` at function entry.
//! * `AC` — defence against SMAP bypass / explicit alignment quirks.
//! * `IOPL` — a user task must never carry I/O privilege into ring 0;
//!   clearing `IOPL` on entry means kernel code always runs at
//!   `IOPL=0` regardless of the caller's `RFLAGS` (matches Linux's
//!   `MSR_SYSCALL_MASK`; `tests/SECURITY.md` §5, CWE-696).
//! * `NT`, `RF`, `VM` — task-switching and virtual-8086 holdovers
//!   that have no meaning in long mode and must not affect kernel
//!   state.
//!
//! # Why a callback?
//!
//! `kernel/arch/x86_64` is dep-light by design (one production dep,
//! `tairix-abi`, see `Cargo.toml`). Pulling in `kernel/syscall` here
//! would invert the layering — the dispatcher already depends on
//! `kernel/sec`, `kernel/sched`, `lib/log`, and `lib/crypto`. The
//! arch port instead exposes a single atomic callback slot
//! ([`set_dispatch_callback`]); the binary (Stage 3a (c7)) installs
//! a thin shim that constructs a `RawArgs` from the
//! `[u64; SYSCALL_MAX_ARGS]` the stub builds (the two are
//! `#[repr(transparent)]`-compatible) and forwards into
//! `Dispatcher::dispatch`. Argument validation, capability checks,
//! and audit emission all stay in `kernel/syscall`.
