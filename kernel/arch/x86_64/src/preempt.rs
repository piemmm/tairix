//! LAPIC-timer-driven preemption (Stage 3a (c5)).
//!
//! This module owns the per-CPU preemption surface on x86_64:
//!
//! * The IDT vector the timer LVT fires on ([`TIMER_VECTOR`]).
//! * The ISR stub emitted by [`crate::define_isr`] that captures the
//!   GPRs and trampolines into a Rust dispatcher.
//! * The Rust dispatcher itself (`tairix_arch_x86_64_timer_dispatch`)
//!   which forwards into the user-installed callback and then issues
//!   the LAPIC end-of-interrupt write.
//! * A per-CPU init helper (`init_local_preempt`) that installs the
//!   timer ISR into the per-CPU IDT, programs the LAPIC timer in
//!   periodic mode from the BSP-supplied `Calibration`, and returns.
//!
//! The dispatcher, the ISR stub emitted by [`crate::define_isr`], and
//! `init_local_preempt` are gated to `target_os = "none"` because
//! they reach for LAPIC MMIO and naked-asm; rustdoc on the host
//! target therefore does not see them. The bare-metal documentation
//! lives next to those items in the source.
//!
//! The kernel-side preemption logic lives in
//! `kernel/sched::Scheduler::on_timer_tick`; this module merely wires
//! the x86_64 hardware into the architecture-neutral surface. The
//! split keeps (no interface creep) honest — the
//! arch port owns timer state, the scheduler owns the run-queue
//! mutation that follows from a tick.
//!
//! # LAPIC-timer-calibration policy
//!
//! Calibration on x86 derives from busy-waiting against the i8254 PIT
//! (see [`crate::apic_timer::calibrate`]), which is a single global
//! device. Doing it concurrently on every CPU would corrupt PIT
//! channel 2. The QEMU integration test
//! (`tests/integration/scheduler_stress_qemu`) therefore calibrates
//! exactly once on the BSP and reuses the resulting `Calibration`
//! on every AP. This is correct on QEMU (one bus clock) and on
//! homogeneous single-package SMP Intel systems where the LAPIC
//! timer's source frequency is shared across logical CPUs. Multi-
//! socket asymmetric hardware would need per-package re-calibration;
//! the scheduler-side `Scheduler::preemption_count` assertion in the
//! integration test trips loudly if any CPU's LAPIC fails to
//! advance, so a future port that violates the assumption fails
//! closed.

///    initial-count from `calibration` for the scheduler to arm.
///
/// The function does *not* enable interrupts — the caller is

/// # Safety
///
/// * `cpu_index` must be the index passed to
///   [`crate::percpu::init`] on *this* CPU. Passing another CPU's
///   index would install the timer vector into the wrong IDT.
