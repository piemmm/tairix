//! x86_64 post-mortem CPU-state capture.
//!
//! Implements the Arch HAL
//! [`tairix_arch_api::CpuStateCapture`] surface for
//! x86_64: a read-only register snapshot and the System V frame-pointer
//! layout the neutral unwinder in `kernel/core` follows.
//!
//! # Frame layout
//!
//! With frame pointers forced (`.cargo/config.toml` carries
//! `-C force-frame-pointers=yes` for `x86_64-tairix-none`), every
//! function maintains `rbp` as its frame pointer. The prologue pushes the
//! caller's `rbp` and the `call` instruction pushed the return address
//! just above it, so relative to the current `rbp`:
//!
//! * the caller's saved `rbp` is at `[rbp + 0]`,
//! * the return address into the caller is at `[rbp + 8]`.
//!
//! # Stack bounds
//!
//! The bootstrap processor runs on the linker-reserved boot stack, addressed
//! through the kernel window (`boot_stack_bottom_high ..
//! boot_stack_top_high`, the higher-half aliases of the low symbols
//! `linker.ld` reserves) because that is what `%rsp` holds and what stays
//! mapped under every root.
//! `boot_stack` returns that region, rooted, when the captured `sp` lies
//! within it and `None` otherwise — a kthread stack, which the kernel
//! resolves instead — so the unwinder never reads memory the port cannot
//! vouch for (fail closed, never a fault inside the fault handler). The
//! region carries the pointer its words are read *through*, minted here
//! because the linker reservation is a fact only the port holds.
