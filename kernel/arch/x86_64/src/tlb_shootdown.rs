//! Cross-CPU TLB shootdown on x86_64 (the `plans/WIRING.md` W6 slice of
//! the Arch HAL "TLB shootdown" surface).
//!
//! x86_64 has no broadcast TLB-invalidation instruction: `invlpg` only
//! affects the CPU that executes it. To make a page-table edit globally
//! visible the initiating CPU must therefore *interrupt* every other
//! online CPU and have each one run `invlpg` for the affected page —
//! the classic inter-processor "TLB shootdown". This module owns that
//! protocol; `crate::kernel_arch::X86_64Arch` implements
//! [`tairix_arch_api::CrossCpuTlbShootdown`] over it.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! A single global descriptor (`SHOOTDOWN`) serialises shootdowns behind a
//! spin-acquired flag, so the (rare) page-table-teardown path never races
//! itself across CPUs. The initiator:
//!
//! 1. builds the set of CPUs to interrupt as a bitmap of LAPIC ids, minus
//!    its own bit (`target_map`),
//! 2. spin-acquires the descriptor lock,
//! 3. stores the target range and the outstanding-acknowledge count, then
//!    publishes the bitmap **last** — the bitmap is the "go" signal,
//! 4. raises a [`TLB_SHOOTDOWN_VECTOR`] IPI at each CPU in the bitmap,
//! 5. invalidates the range on *itself* with `invlpg` — unless it asked for
//!    the remote half only (`shootdown_remote`, a user unmap that already
//!    flushed each page as it cleared it),
//! 6. spins until every target has acknowledged (the count reaches zero),
//!    then releases the lock.
//!
//! With no target at all — the single-CPU case — there is nothing to publish
//! and nobody to wait for, so the call is just the local `invlpg` sweep (or
//! nothing, for the remote half) and never touches the descriptor. A range
//! past `SINGLE_PAGE_FLUSH_CEILING` pages reloads `CR3` instead of issuing an
//! `invlpg` per page, on the initiator and on every target alike.
//!
//! The spin in step 6 is a genuine, bounded synchronisation, not a "retry
//! until it works" bring-up hack: under-invalidating (returning before a CPU
//! has flushed) is the only failure mode, so the initiator *must* wait for
//! the acknowledge.
//!
//! # A target acknowledges from a spin as readily as from its ISR
//!
//! The acknowledge is `serve_pending`, reached from two places: the
//! shootdown ISR, and any spin round in `lib/sync` (the boot path installs it
//! as that crate's spin service). Both matter, because a CPU whose own
//! interrupts are masked cannot take the IPI at all — and masking is exactly
//! what `tairix_sync::IrqSafeSpinLock` does for the whole of its acquire
//! spin, the kernel heap's lock included. An initiator holding that heap lock
//! and a second CPU spinning to acquire it would otherwise wait on each other
//! for ever: the initiator for an acknowledge the masked CPU cannot send, the
//! masked CPU for a lock the initiator will not release until it has one.
//!
//! Serving from a spin means a target could otherwise acknowledge twice —
//! once from the spin, once when the deferred IPI is finally delivered —
//! double-decrementing the count and returning the *next* initiator early,
//! i.e. under-invalidating. The bitmap forecloses it: a target claims by
//! clearing its own bit, so the prior value that `fetch_and` returns is both
//! the claim and the "am I a target?" test, and exactly one caller can win
//! it. A CPU whose bit is already clear — a stale delivery, a CPU that was
//! never asked, the initiator itself — invalidates nothing and decrements
//! nothing. The ISR still writes its LAPIC EOI unconditionally: the
//! in-service bit is set whether or not there was work to do.
//!
//! # Host build
//!
//! The descriptor, the ISR, and the install helper are gated to
//! `target_os = "none"`: they reach LAPIC MMIO and the per-CPU IDT. The
//! bitmap bookkeeping is not, so the decisions the protocol rests on — who
//! is asked, who is excluded, how many acknowledges are owed — are
//! host-tested below. The host `X86_64Arch` shootdown impl is a vacuous
//! no-op (there is no second CPU and no TLB) and the conformance vertical
//! asserts only that the call is total and panic-free; the real cross-CPU
//! round-trip, including the masked-spin acknowledge, is proven by the
//! `cross_cpu_tlb_shootdown_qemu_x86_64` QEMU vertical.
