//! `extern "C" fn tairix_arch_x86_64_main` — the Rust side of the boot
//! trampoline.
//!
//! The 32-bit assembly in `boot.s` finishes by `call`ing this symbol with
//! the boot magic in `%rdi` and the boot-info pointer in `%rsi`
//! (System V AMD64 ABI, see `boot.s` SAFETY-INVARIANT 7). The magic is
//! either the multiboot2 bootloader magic (GRUB entered `_start`) or the
//! PVH start-info magic (QEMU's `-kernel` ELF loader entered
//! `pvh_start`).
//!
//! This function validates the magic, records which protocol delivered
//! the boot info (`crate::bootinfo`), and then transfers control to a
//! binary-supplied `extern "C" fn kernel_main() -> !`. Every test binary
//! defines that symbol exactly once.

    /// binary that does need it (e.g.
    /// `tests/integration/scheduler_stress_qemu`) parses it via

///
/// # Behaviour
///
/// 1. Validates the boot magic against the two protocols the trampoline
///    accepts; anything else is a closed-fail (validate every input).
/// 2. Records the protocol in [`crate::bootinfo`] so
///    [`crate::bootinfo::BootData::load`] can dispatch without
///    re-guessing; a second record attempt is a boot-path defect and
///    also fails closed.
/// 3. Quiesces the legacy 8259 PICs ([`crate::pic`]): a BIOS-style
///    hand-off (`SeaBIOS` in front of PVH direct boot, or a real
///    legacy-boot machine) leaves them unmasked at vector base 8, where
///    the first PIT tick taken with `IF=1` would be decoded as `#DF`.
/// 4. Installs the boot descriptor tables
///    ([`crate::percpu::install_boot_tables`]), so every exception reaches
///    the fatal path — and a binary that installed no fault handler gets the
///    port's own report — instead of triple-faulting through the invalid
///    IDTR `boot.s` leaves. A binary observes its own faults through the
///    fault-handler slot, and the kernel replaces the tables with its
///    per-CPU ones.
/// 5. Transfers to the binary-supplied `kernel_main`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implicitly safe to call from the asm trampoline because the
/// invariants in `boot.s` are upheld. Calling from anywhere else is a
/// kernel bug.
