//! Task lifecycle vocabulary shared by every scheduler policy.
//!
//! A task is the smallest unit a scheduler dispatches. Conceptually it is
//! an in-kernel thread of control: an identity, a state machine, and a
//! body to execute on its turn. These types are policy-neutral — the
//! concrete per-task storage (the boxed body, the atomics) lives in each
//! `kernel/sched/<impl>` crate, not here.
//!
//! ## State machine
//!
//! ```text
//!         spawn                     unpark
//!           │                          │
//!           ▼                          │
//!         Ready ◀──── Yield ────── Running ──── Park ───▶ Parked
//!                                     │                     │
//!                                     └──── Exit ───▶ Exited
//! ```
//!
//! A job-control `stop` takes a task out beside that cycle, into
//! [`TaskState::Stopped`] — or [`TaskState::StoppedParked`] for a parked one,
//! which `resume` leaves parked — and only `resume` or `exit` ends it: a wake
//! does not. `unpark`, `stop`, `resume`, and `exit` are *cancellation-safe*: an
//! implementation may be issued one while the task is running on another CPU
//! and must apply it at the next safe point. See
//! `docs/src/architecture/scheduler.md` for the full invariants.
