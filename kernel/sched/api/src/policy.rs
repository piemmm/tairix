//! The [`SchedulerPolicy`] contract.
//!
//! Every concrete scheduler lives in its own `kernel/sched/<impl>` crate
//! and implements this trait; no crate outside `kernel/sched/*` and
//! `kernel/core` may name a concrete scheduler type. `kernel/core`
//! selects exactly one implementation at build time and the rest of the
//! kernel depends on this trait (or a generic `Scheduler<P: SchedulerPolicy>`),
//! never on a concrete policy.
//!
//! The trait deliberately mirrors the operational surface enumerates:
//! task admission ([`spawn`](SchedulerPolicy::spawn)), picking the next
//! runnable task on a CPU ([`step`](SchedulerPolicy::step)) and settling the
//! yield, park or exit its body returns, wake and job control
//! ([`unpark`](SchedulerPolicy::unpark) / [`stop`](SchedulerPolicy::stop) /
//! [`resume`](SchedulerPolicy::resume) / [`exit`](SchedulerPolicy::exit)),
//! priority/quantum accounting (driven by
//! [`on_timer_tick`](SchedulerPolicy::on_timer_tick) and observable through
//! [`preemption_count`](SchedulerPolicy::preemption_count)), and the SMP
//! hooks (per-CPU run queues, work stealing, IPI-driven preemption) which
//! the implementation routes through the [`SchedulerArch`] surface.
