//! Shared `SchedulerPolicy` conformance suite.
//!
//! Every concrete scheduler must pass this suite. It is written purely
//! against the [`SchedulerPolicy`] trait and the host [`TestArch`], so it
//! drives any policy without naming a concrete type. The companion
//! integration test `kernel/sched/api/tests/conformance.rs` runs
//! [`run_all`] against the selected implementation, and each
//! `kernel/sched/<impl>` crate runs it against itself.
//!
//! [`run_all`] is deterministic and single-threaded: it drives `cpus`
//! simulated cores round-robin from one host thread, advancing
//! [`TestArch`]'s tick counter explicitly. That keeps the assertions
//! reproducible (no flaky tests) while still exercising
//! the ≥ 4-core SMP paths (per-CPU queues, work stealing, IPI bookkeeping).
//! [`run_races`] holds the few properties only real host threads can
//! interleave, each repeated over enough rounds to reach the interleaving it
//! guards.
//!
//! Only the public trait surface is used — no implementation internals —
//! so the same source is a valid acceptance test for a future EEVDF, RT,
//! or any other policy.
