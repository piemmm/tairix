//! Concrete per-task storage for the MLFQ policy.
//!
//! The policy-neutral lifecycle vocabulary ([`Priority`], [`TaskState`],
//! [`TaskAction`], [`TaskContext`], [`TaskId`]) is defined once in
//! `kernel/sched/api` and re-exported by this
//! crate. This module owns only the MLFQ-specific representation of a
//! live task: the boxed body and the atomics the dispatch loop CAS-es.
//!
//! The body is a closure (`FnMut(&mut TaskContext) -> TaskAction`) so the
//! scheduler is host-testable; the real context-switch machinery lands
//! with the architecture ports. `unpark`, `stop`, `resume`, and `exit` are
//! *cancellation-safe*: they may be issued while the task is running on
//! another CPU and take effect at the next safe point. See
//! `docs/src/architecture/scheduler.md` for the full invariants.
