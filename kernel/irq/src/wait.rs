//! Shared cooperative blocking loop for [`IrqTable`] waiters.
//!
//! Two independent in-kernel call sites need to block a task until a
//! bound IRQ line fires:
//!
//! * the `irq_wait` `abi-v1` syscall handler in
//!   `kernel/core::syscalls`, and
//! * the in-kernel `KernelVirtioHost::notify_wait` path in
//!   `drivers/bus/virtio` (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.3).
//!
//! Both run the same loop: compute a deadline once, poll
//! [`IrqTable::try_wait_step`], and cooperatively yield between polls
//! until the line fires, the deadline elapses, or the binding
//! disappears. To avoid two copies of that loop,
//! the loop lives here exactly once and is parameterised over the
//! clock + yield seam through the [`IrqWaiter`] trait.
//!
//! `kernel/irq` stays free of any scheduler or architecture
//! dependency: the trait is the inversion point, and each caller
//! supplies its own implementation (the syscall handler parks the
//! caller off the run queue and reads `KernelArch::monotonic_ns`; the
//! virtio host wraps the kernel-binary's equivalent seam).
