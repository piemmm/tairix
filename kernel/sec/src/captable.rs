//! Per-task capability state.
//!
//! Every running task has a [`TaskCapabilities`] record. The effective
//! capability set is **the intersection** of two narrower-or-equal sets:
//!
//! * the user grant attached to the task's owning [`UserId`], and
//! * the capability set the binary's signed manifest *requested*.
//!
//! Both halves enter through the verifier in `manifest.rs` and the
//! verifier in `identity.rs`; this module never widens what those modules
//! sanctioned. Delegation and revocation are forwarded to
//! `lib/caps` — the single source of truth for the subset-only delegation
//! invariant — and every transition emits exactly one audit event.
//!
//! # No ambient authority
//!
//! Nothing in this module branches on `uid == 0`. The numeric uid is
//! attached purely so the audit trail can attribute a record to a
//! principal; it confers no extra capability.
