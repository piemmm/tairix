//! In-kernel [`VirtioHost`] backed by a per-process [`DmaPool`].
//!
//! The test-only `tairix_virtio::MockHost` satisfies
//! [`tairix_virtio::VirtioHost`] by leaking `Box<[u8]>` storage; the
//! [`KernelVirtioHost`] here satisfies the same trait but routes every
//! allocation through the capability-gated [`tairix_kernel_sec::alloc_dma`]
//! / [`tairix_kernel_sec::free_dma`] pair.
//!
//! The host owns a single [`tairix_kernel_mem::DmaPool`] (per-driver
//! pool "per-process heaps, never a global user
//! heap"). Allocations:
//!
//! 1. `kernel_sec::alloc_dma` performs the `CapabilityId::MEM_DMA`
//!    check and emits the `AuditEvent::DmaAllocated` / `…Denied`
//!    record. The pool zero-fills the data slots; the bytes are
//!    therefore safe to publish into a virtio descriptor without an
//!    extra scrub pass.
//! 2. The host obtains the raw, non-null base pointer through
//!    [`DmaPool::slot_base`] and mints a [`DmaSlab`] via
//!    [`DmaSlab::from_pool`]; the slab carries a generic free shim
//!    that re-enters the host on drop and routes the buffer back
//!    through `kernel_sec::free_dma`.
//! 3. The host records the live `(slot, DmaBuffer)` pair in an
//!    internal table so the drop-path shim — which receives only
//!    `(*const(), slot, len)` — can recover the originating
//!    [`DmaBuffer`] without further state in the slab.
//!
//! [`KernelVirtioHost::notify_wait`] blocks the calling driver task on
//! a per-host pre-bound [`IrqHandle`] until the device raises its
//! interrupt line, driving the shared
//! [`tairix_kernel_irq::block_until_ready`] poll-and-yield loop
//! through an injected [`IrqWaiter`] (Stage 4.D Item 2-tail.3). The
//! polled in-process `notify_log` is retained only on the test-only
//! `tairix_virtio::MockHost`; the production wake-up is the IRQ path.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The unsafe construction site is [`DmaSlab::from_pool`]. Every
//! invariant required by that constructor is established here:
//!
//! * `pool_ptr` is `self as *const Self as *const ()`; the slab's
//!   lifetime is bounded by `'a`, which is the lifetime of the
//!   `KernelVirtioHost`. The borrow checker enforces that no slab
//!   minted by this host outlives the host's borrow.
//! * `ptr` is the result of [`DmaPool::slot_base`], which is
//!   documented to be a non-null, page-aligned pointer covering
//!   exactly `buf.len()` disjoint bytes (witnessed by the pool's
//!   slot bitmap — one slot ↔ one allocation).
//! * The free shim is monomorphised per `(P, S)`; the cast back from
//!   `*const ()` to `*const KernelVirtioHost<'_, P, S>` is the
//!   inverse of the cast performed at construction and therefore
//!   sound.
