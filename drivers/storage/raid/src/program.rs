//! The freestanding body of the RAID array-composer `Run` binary
//! (`main.rs`): the reserved rendezvous, the offer→assemble→publish loop, and
//! the live-array serve path (`plans/FIX-IO.md` `IO6d`).
//!
//! # One process, one park, several event-timed sources
//!
//! The composer owns the reserved [`RAID_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`] every member
//! agent offers to, and one block-service endpoint per live array. All of them
//! ride a single wait-set, and each turn the composer:
//!
//! 1. ends the membership of every agent that has exited, taking its device
//!    out of any array it was composed into;
//! 2. drains every pending offer, reading the offered device's superblock
//!    itself and feeding the registry;
//! 3. does what the registry's [`ComposerAction`] says — assemble and publish
//!    a ready array, place a returning member into a live one, or wait;
//! 4. serves every live array's queued block requests through the shared
//!    fault-aware engine;
//! 5. gives each array one bounded turn of self-maintenance — re-admitting a
//!    returning member, advancing a rebuild, verifying the array, or writing
//!    down where it has got to; and
//! 6. parks until the soonest of the registry's settle/backoff deadline, the
//!    arrays' recovery grace windows, and their maintenance deadlines, or
//!    until any endpoint signals or a watched agent exits.
//!
//! Nothing here spins: every wait is a one-shot timeout or a wait-set wake, so
//! a quiet composer costs a quiet core. A turn that actually moved a rebuild
//! or a scrub forward comes straight back round instead of parking, so an idle
//! array heals at full speed while a busy one keeps yielding to its workload —
//! but every such turn does real I/O, so the loop is never a poll.
//!
//! # A member node is a pointer to look, never a datum to believe
//!
//! An offered endpoint, window, and node id are hostile until proven: the
//! offer decodes fail-closed; before anything it names is touched, the kernel
//! must attest that its sender is the driver of a member or candidate node
//! whose one endpoint and one region are exactly what the offer names, and
//! that the endpoint is not the composer's own; the window must map at least
//! the data length; the device must answer geometry; and its array, slot, and
//! generation come from the superblock read off the disk — never from anything
//! the agent said. Any failure refuses that one membership and never disturbs
//! the others.
