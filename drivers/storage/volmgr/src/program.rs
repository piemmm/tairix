//! The freestanding body of the volume-manager `Run` binary (`main.rs`):
//! grant resolution, the blkio probe, and the attach loop
//! (`plans/DEVICES.md` D3c).
//!
//! # Probe first, then hand the device over
//!
//! The probe and the kernel's mounts drive the *same* served device over the
//! *same* single shared data window, which the blkio protocol stages each
//! transfer's bytes in. Two users of that window at once would overwrite each
//! other's staged bytes and read back another extent's data — silent
//! corruption, not a fault. So the two phases are strictly ordered here: the
//! whole device is probed by [`probe_device`], which owns the transport for
//! its whole life, and only then is the first volume attached. The window
//! borrow therefore ends with that call, so the compiler, not a convention,
//! is what stops a later probe read from racing the kernel
//! (`plans/FIX-IO.md`).
