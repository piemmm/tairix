//! TAIRiX virtio-blk block driver.
//!
//! Implements [`tairix_abi::driver::block::Block`] on top of the
//! bus-agnostic virtio protocol from `lib/virtio`. The driver is
//! bus-agnostic: the same source compiles against the PCI and MMIO
//! transports (from `drivers/bus/virtio`) because both implement the
//! [`tairix_virtio::Transport`] trait. (the queue protocol lives once, in `lib/virtio`.)
//!
//! # Public surface
//!
//! Per the only public *function* is [`register`].
//! [`VirtioBlk`] is a public *type* re-exported so the driver host
//! can instantiate it; the host never reaches into the type beyond
//! the [`Block`] trait.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! Loading requires [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`]. The block driver
//! does not request `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`; it runs in user space per.
//!
//! # Zero-on-free
//!
//! The classified `read_blocks_with_class` / `write_blocks_with_class`
//! methods scrub the data staging when a sensitive request ends, or, when the
//! device still holds it, once the device or a confirmed reset hands it back.
//!
//! # Device status → health class
//!
//! A `virtio_blk_req` completes with a one-byte status (virtio 1.1
//! §5.2.6). Both the data path and the flush path decode it through the
//! single `status_to_result` so they cannot classify a status
//! differently, and the mapping carries an honest **health axis** rather
//! than collapsing every non-`OK` outcome to one fault: `VIRTIO_BLK_S_IOERR`
//! is a per-request medium error ([`DriverError::MediumError`]) a consumer
//! can recover around and repair — not a whole-device
//! [`DriverError::DeviceFault`] that would needlessly drop the device;
//! `VIRTIO_BLK_S_UNSUPP` is a request-level [`DriverError::Unsupported`];
//! and any *undefined* status byte fails closed to
//! [`DriverError::DeviceFault`] rather than being assumed benign.

#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// Only the unit tests (`mod tests`) allocate; the driver's data path
// is `alloc`-free by design (persistent DMA staging, no per-request
// heap copy), so the crate needs `alloc` in test builds only.
