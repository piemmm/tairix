# `tairix-drv-display-framebuffer` — framebuffer display service

The user-space framebuffer display-service process (`plans/DISPLAY.md`
D7b): the `Run` entry point of the display-service bundle, installed under
`/System/Drivers/` and autoloaded by `devmgr` when a display node carrying a
`HwResourceKind::Framebuffer` resource is discovered. It is the display half
of the zero-copy, lease-gated present path: a desktop session composes frames
into one `shm_grant`ed region and presents by index over the reserved
`DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`; this process blits the presented frame to the scan-out
surface.

The crate contains **no device logic of its own**. Its host-buildable lib
target is the canonical `BIND_KEYS` the signed manifest is authored from, and
`main` is three calls into `lib/display`: build the driver host from the
kernel-issued grants (`RtDriverHost::from_grants_query`), map the one granted
surface (`service::open_surface`, which resolves `(phys_base, mode)`
fail-closed through `sole_framebuffer` and never scans out a guessed
geometry), and serve it (`service::serve`). The loop, the kernel-attested
caller facts, the frame-region mapping and the lease handling are that one
shared definition, which every display service runs:

- `call_peer_seat` / `call_peer_origin`: the per-request live-lease check on
  the in-flight caller — never a claimed lease — and, for the seatless
  device-statistics read, whether that caller holds `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`.
- `clock_get`: the engine brackets each driver present, so the utilisation a
  monitor reads is measured where the presents happen.
- `shm_map`/`shm_unmap`: a `Configure` maps the client's granted frame region
  once, sized from the kernel's own record of the region length (never the
  client's claimed geometry); the present hot path only indexes the mapped
  bytes.
- One wait-set holding the reserved `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` and the kernel's
  display-lease notice: the service parks between requests, so an idle
  display service costs no CPU, and a lease that ends releases its
  configuration at once.

A firmware linear surface has no power control of its own, so a `SetPower`
is refused `Unsupported`; the desktop then keeps its screensaver black and
still instead. A surface the platform *can* switch off is bound by its own,
more specific driver above this one (`drivers/display/rpi_fb`).

## Supported hardware

Any platform whose discovery publishes a linear scan-out surface as a
`Framebuffer` hardware-tree resource (the FDT `simple-framebuffer`
model, QEMU `ramfb`, a UEFI GOP hand-off normalised by the x86_64
port). The service does not enumerate or program a display controller;
mode-setting on programmable controllers is a separate driver class
(see `gpu_virtio`, `rpi_hvs`).

## Required capabilities

- `CAP_MMIO_MAP` — mapping the scan-out window; the surface is reached
  only through the capability-gated `mmio_map` trap, never a pointer
  the service synthesises itself.
- `CAP_SHM` — mapping the client's granted frame region at `Configure`.
- `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED` — binding the reserved `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`
  rendezvous, so a squatter cannot intercept presents.
- `CAP_LOG_EMIT` — the one-shot `FIRST_PRESENT` diagnostic record
  (`EventId` 15001, `tairix_display::service`), emitted after the first
  client frame reaches the scan-out surface: the operational witness that the
  session → service → surface path is live, checked after the reply so the
  present hot path pays nothing.

The service runs in user space; it does **not** request
`CAP_DRV_KERNEL`. Every present — `Query` included — is gated on the
caller's live seat lease through the kernel's `call_peer_seat`; a
revoked client receives the distinct `SeatRevoked` and its configured
frames are dropped, never scanned out under another lease.

## Failure behaviour

Bring-up failures exit fail-loud with reserved codes (no host: 80, no
surface grant: 81, surface map failed: 82, endpoint bind failed: 83,
wait-set failed: 84), leaving the seat without a display service rather
than wedged or busy-polling; the spawning supervisor decides whether to
relaunch.

## Test surface

The engine logic is host-tested where it lives:

- `lib/display/tests/framebuffer.rs` — the surface engine against a
  mock `MmioMapper` (blit fidelity, damage-region blits, fail-closed
  geometry/capability/short-frame refusals, seat-gated presents,
  unload → reload).
- `lib/display/src/tests.rs` — the `DisplayServer`/`DisplayClient`
  protocol semantics over mock seams and a loopback transport.

The three framebuffer QEMU verticals
(`tests/integration/framebuffer_display_qemu_aarch64`,
`framebuffer_display_qemu_riscv64`, `framebuffer_display_wasm32`) drive
the same shared engine against a real emulated scan-out surface,
including the seat-lease and multi-seat phases. The end-to-end
service-process vertical (display node → autoloaded `Run` → session
present) is `plans/DISPLAY.md` D7d.
