//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the virtio-input driver (keyboard,
//! pointer *and* touch), installed as a signed `/System/Drivers/` bundle and
//! **autoloaded into user space** by `devmgr` when a virtio-input device is
//! discovered (`plans/PI.md` P10 chunk 5d-2-ii).
//!
//! This is the "drivers in user space" steady state for virtio-input on
//! both buses QEMU can present: the single-aperture virtio-MMIO keyboard
//! and its virtio-mouse pointer sibling on `-M virt` (aarch64/riscv64), and
//! the scattered virtio-**PCI** `virtio-keyboard-pci` / `virtio-mouse-pci`
//! on a PC (x86_64); the metal Pi 4 keyboard is the USB
//! `drivers/input/usb_kbd`. One driver instance is spawned per discovered
//! virtio-input node, and each instance serves whatever event stream its
//! own device produces — the bind table cannot know whether a node is a
//! keyboard or a mouse, so every instance runs both producers and the
//! device decides which of them ever yields a record. The kernel mints
//! this process exactly the device-resource grants its matched node requested
//! — the device's register window(s), a DMA constraint, and its interrupt
//! line, and no more — and this program reaches them through the rt-backed
//! `RtDriverHost`. It names no board or transport detail: it maps the
//! granted window(s) by address, carves a DMA region, and speaks the
//! bus-agnostic virtio split-virtqueue protocol via the arch-neutral
//! `tairix_virtio_input` composition over whichever `tairix_virtio`
//! transport the grant shape selects (a single-aperture MMIO aperture or
//! the four role-tagged PCI config windows).
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it
//! links the Rust userland runtime `tairix-rt`, never the C ABI (which exists
//! solely for non-Rust programs). `tairix-rt` provides
//! `_start`, the per-process stack canary, the panic
//! handler, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's
//! `main`. It is a separate crate from the `tairix-drv-input-virtio-input`
//! driver shell (which the kernel still links for the transitional in-kernel
//! `-M virt` verticals) so the userland runtime never enters the kernel's
//! dependency graph.
//!
//! `main` wires the real seams the bring-up and the report pump drive:
//!
//! * `RtDriverHost::from_grants_query` over `RtGrantSyscalls`: the host
//!   learns its kernel-issued grants through the `resource_grants` syscall and
//!   maps/carves them through `mmio_map` / `dma_alloc`. Every capability and
//!   bound is re-checked kernel-side, on the far side of the trap; the host adds no authority. The DMA carve is coherent kernel-side
//!   (the QEMU `virt` virtio interconnect snoops the CPU caches), so no
//!   architecture-specific cache-maintenance shim is supplied here
//!   (`coherency = None`, keeping the program platform-neutral).
//! * Transport selection by grant shape: `virtio_pci_windows` resolving the
//!   four role-tagged config windows the kernel PCI probe delivered builds a
//!   `PciTransport` (selecting the kernel-routed MSI-X entry); otherwise
//!   `sole_register_window` reads the single MMIO aperture `(base, len)` and
//!   builds an `MmioTransport`. Every window `(base, len)` is read from the
//!   grants the kernel delivered, never a build-time board constant, and the
//!   driver never reads PCI configuration space (the kernel resolved and
//!   role-tagged every window). One signed bundle thus binds on either bus.
//! * `VirtioInput::open_armed` over the built transport: brings the
//!   virtio-input device online, posts its event queue, and only then binds
//!   the granted interrupt (the arm step), so readiness is never advertised
//!   before the device can accept a keystroke.
//! * The poll/feed/inject loop: each decoded `InputEvent` is offered to the
//!   shared pointer mapping first (`PointerInput::from_device_event` — axis
//!   deltas, the `BTN_*` button edges, and scroll ticks) and injected
//!   through `pointer_inject`; every other event is resolved into a `KeyInput`
//!   record by `VirtioKeyboardConsole` and injected through `key_inject`.
//!   Both syscalls route by who holds the seat; the driver never chooses
//!   the encoding or the destination, and it never learns the screen —
//!   pointer records carry relative displacements the seat owner
//!   accumulates (`lib/abi` `input`).
//!
//! After bring-up `main` pumps the device forever, **parking on the granted
//! device interrupt** between events: `VirtioInput::poll` waits through the
//! host's `notify_wait` (the kernel `irq_wait` park) and acknowledges the
//! device each cycle, so an idle keyboard costs no CPU — never a yield-poll
//! loop. The interrupt bind is the `open_armed` arm step, issued only once
//! the device's eventq is live (buffers posted, device kicked): the audited
//! `irq_bind` syscall is the kernel-observable readiness witness, and binding
//! any earlier would advertise a keyboard that can still silently drop a
//! keystroke. A bind failure or a hard poll fault
//! exits fail-loud; a broken device is never retried in a spin.
//! A bring-up failure exits with a reserved fail-closed code, leaving the
//! console without a keyboard rather than wedged; the
//! spawning supervisor decides whether to relaunch.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
