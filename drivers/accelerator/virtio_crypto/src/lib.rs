//! TAIRiX virtio-crypto accelerator driver.
//!
//! Implements [`tairix_abi::driver::accelerator::Accelerator`] over the
//! bus-agnostic virtio protocol from `lib/virtio`, so the same source drives
//! the device on either transport: a virtio-crypto device is the same protocol
//! whether it arrives on PCI or on an MMIO slot.
//!
//! # Public surface
//!
//! [`register`] is the driver entry point. [`VirtioCrypto`] is a public
//! *type* the hosting binary and the host tests instantiate; nothing reaches
//! into it beyond the `Accelerator` trait.
//!
//! # A session per job, and no key kept
//!
//! virtio-crypto binds a key *and a direction* into a device-side session
//! (virtio 1.2 §5.9.7.1.1), which a throughput-minded driver would create once
//! and reuse. This one creates the session, runs the job and destroys the
//! session inside the single [`Accelerator::cipher`] call, because reuse would
//! mean holding the caller's key to compare the next job's against — and a
//! retained key is a key a compromised driver can be made to use again. The
//! cost is two extra control-queue round trips per job; the guarantee bought
//! is that no key material outlives the call that supplied it, on either side
//! of the device boundary. A consumer that needs the throughput needs a
//! caller-owned session handle on the class trait, which is a different
//! interface and arrives with that consumer.
//!
//! # The device is untrusted
//!
//! Every figure read from the device's configuration space is treated as
//! hostile input: the advertised per-request ceiling is clamped to
//! [`MAX_STAGED_JOB_BYTES`] before it sizes any allocation, an unrecognised
//! algorithm bit is ignored rather than offered, and a device that reports
//! itself not ready, offers no cipher service, or advertises no data queue is
//! refused at bring-up instead of driven.
//!
//! # Status decoding
//!
//! Both the control and the data path decode their reply through one shared
//! `status_to_result`, so neither can classify an outcome the other would read
//! differently. The mapping keeps an honest axis: a rejected key or an
//! unsupported request is a request-level refusal the caller can act on, and
//! any *undefined* status byte fails closed to
//! [`DriverError::DeviceFault`] rather than being assumed benign.
