//! Deterministic fuzz harness for the arxfs mount / metadata-decode path.
//!
//! [`ARXFS::open`] decodes a device's superblock ring, transaction root,
//! inode-tree nodes, per-file extent-tree nodes, and — since Stage 7 — the
//! chunk/refcount tree and the reverse-reference tree (mount rebuilds the
//! dedupe index from them, decoding every `ChunkRecord` and reverse-reference
//! record). All are self-identifying metadata (`header` / `superblock` /
//! `transaction` / `btree` / `dedupe`) read from a backing store that, on a
//! real system, may have been written by anything. The base image is
//! populated with several files, a multi-extent file, **duplicate-content
//! files, a reflink, and a symbolic link** so the sweep spends its time near
//! real inode-tree, extent-tree, chunk-tree, reverse-reference, and link
//! nodes, not just the superblock ring. Per that decode path is driven by a fuzz harness
//! whose single invariant is:
//!
//! * `open` never panics for any device contents — it returns `Ok` for a
//!   genuinely valid volume and `Err` (fail closed) for everything else.
//!
//! A mounted volume is then driven through the remaining decode paths the
//! "fuzz targets" list enumerates: the **directory-block decode** path
//! (`read_dir`/`lookup` decrypt and parse the encrypted dirent payload that
//! the mount-time free-space walk never reads), the **symbolic-link decode**
//! path (`read_link` over an inode of on-disk kind `3`, whose target is held
//! as node data and reached through the same integrity pipeline as file
//! bytes), the scrub-progress and health-baseline record decoders
//! (`scrub`/`health`), the offline `check` re-walk, and the read-only
//! `rescue` root scan. Each shares the same invariant: it returns a
//! `Result`, never panics, and fails closed.
//!
//! TAIRiX pulls in no external fuzz runner: a per-run-seeded
//! `Prng` draws pseudo-random images, and a structured sweep flips bytes of a real
//! formatted image to hammer the block-identity checks (magic, type,
//! address, keyed authenticator). Stage 3 added the keyed metadata
//! authenticator and a redundant mirror copy of every metadata block, so the
//! single-byte sweep also exercises the authenticate-then-fall-back-to-the-
//! mirror path, and a dedicated **duplicated-copy sweep** corrupts *both*
//! copies of each block pair to hammer the both-copies-bad fail-closed path.
//!
//! Each `exercise` mounts and fully re-checks an encrypted volume (open, a
//! directory walk, scrub, the offline `check`, health, a reopen, and a raw
//! `rescue` scan), so it is orders of magnitude heavier than a byte decoder.
//! A plain `cargo test` — a developer machine and the per-PR `ci` gate, with no
//! budget — therefore runs a single quick smoke pass: a small, seed-driven
//! [`SMOKE_FLIP_SAMPLES`] sample of the single-byte sweep plus
//! [`SMOKE_ITERATIONS`] PRNG images, all from a fresh, logged seed. The
//! time-limited GitHub soak (`cargo xtask fuzz`) exports
//! `TAIRIX_FUZZ_BUDGET_SECS`, which switches the harness to its budgeted
//! coverage — byte positions are swept in a seeded full-coverage order until
//! the wall-clock budget elapses (the nightly budget flips every byte of the
//! image) and the PRNG loop runs to the same budget. The cheap, deterministic
//! both-copies-bad sweep runs in either mode.
