//! Block allocation: the write-path-only allocator state and the block I/O
//! that reads, updates, and stamps the on-disk allocation map
//! (`docs/src/filesystem/arxfs-spec.md` §4, §6).
//!
//! Everything here exists only to *change* a volume. A read-only handle holds
//! no [`Allocator`] at all — the field is `None` — so a read-only mount cannot
//! allocate, free, dedupe, or trim even by mistake, and pays none of the cost
//! of the state that would let it: it reads no allocation map, builds no
//! index, and walks no tree. That is what makes mounting the signed, read-only
//! `/System` volume a handful of block reads rather than a walk over every
//! inode and extent on it.
//!
//! The map's layout and bit arithmetic are [`crate::allocmap`] and its resident
//! pages live in the shared bounded cache [`crate::pagecache`]; this module is
//! the I/O and the allocation policy over them.
//!
//! # Keeping the resident cost bounded
//!
//! Marking blocks used or free must never fail, because it happens on paths
//! that cannot report an error — rolling a failed operation back, for one. So
//! [`ARXFS::mark_run_used`] and [`ARXFS::mark_run_free`] apply the change
//! directly to every bitmap page that is resident along with its summary block
//! (the ordinary case, since allocation has just read them) and record the rest
//! as pending. Pending changes are folded in — exactly, with the block reads
//! that needs — at the next allocation and at commit, so they never accumulate
//! beyond one transaction's worth and the free count is exact whenever the
//! volume is at rest.
//!
//! Every set here is a set of **runs** ([`RangeSet`]), so a transaction's
//! bookkeeping costs one entry per contiguous run it touches and never one per
//! block: releasing a hundred-terabyte file releases its extents, each of which
//! is contiguous by construction.
//!
//! # When the map is trustworthy
//!
//! The map is stamped clean, naming the generation it reflects, at an explicit
//! sync (`fs_sync`) and at mkfs. Ordinary commits leave it dirty on the device
//! while keeping it exact in RAM, so a mount after a crash rebuilds rather
//! than adopting a half-written map. That is the rebuildable-metadata contract
//! being used as designed: the authoritative trees can always reproduce free
//! space, so the map never needs the copy-on-write and self-allocation
//! machinery an authoritative structure would.
