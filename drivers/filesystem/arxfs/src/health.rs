//! Device-health baselines and health-triggered scrub
//! (`docs/src/filesystem/arxfs-spec.md` §11, §15.11).
//!
//! `ARXFS` keeps a notion of the volume's health so it can decide *when* a
//! scrub is worth running, rather than only running one on demand. It leans
//! on the seams the earlier stages built and never adds a
//! second integrity or scrub path:
//!
//! * **The baseline.** A self-identifying [`BlockType::HealthBaseline`] block
//!   reached from the transaction root (like the Stage-8 scrub-progress
//!   record) stores the **last clean device-health snapshot** the next health
//!   pass compares against, plus the volume's **accumulated
//!   filesystem-observed fault counters** — metadata copy-repairs and
//!   unrepairable blocks (the Stage-3 companion-repair seam) and per-class
//!   data faults ([`crate::integrity::DataFault`], the Stage-5 seam). The
//!   device snapshot is *the last clean state* and the accumulated counters
//!   are a durable history, so both are **persisted**, not rebuildable:
//!   a transient fault that was repaired leaves no trace in the live trees.
//!   The block is the single source of truth; a crash mid-update leaves the
//!   previously committed baseline (or none) selected and never blocks a mount.
//! * **The report + thresholds.** [`ARXFS::health`] returns a structured
//!   [`HealthReport`] (mirroring [`crate::ScrubReport`] / [`crate::CheckReport`]
//!   / [`crate::TrimReport`]) that classifies the volume against the documented
//!   [`HealthThresholds`] — healthy / degraded / failing — with no magic
//!   numbers buried in code.
//! * **Health-triggered scrub.** A rise in the device's unsafe-shutdown or
//!   media-error counters since the baseline triggers a scrub through the
//!   Stage-8 [`ARXFS::scrub`] machinery — its `CAP_FS_MOUNT` gate, its budget,
//!   its resumable/interrupt-safe core — never a parallel verifier. The triggered scrub's findings fold back into the
//!   accumulated counters.
//! * **Capability-gated + logged.** The whole operation is gated on
//!   [`CapabilityId::FS_MOUNT`] (the mount-management capability that already
//!   gates scrub/check/trim) and fails closed and logged otherwise. Health-relevant decisions are logged through
//!   `lib/log` with stable event IDs in the reserved `arxfs`
//!   `12000..13000` range.
//!
//! If the device exposes no telemetry the baseline records
//! [`DeviceHealth::Unavailable`]; the health subsystem stays enabled and
//! classifies from the filesystem-observed counters alone.
