//! Self-identifying metadata-block header (`docs/src/filesystem/arxfs-spec.md` §8 block
//! identity).
//!
//! Every metadata block arxfs writes — superblock-ring slots, transaction
//! roots, commit records, inode-tree and extent-tree nodes, and directory
//! blocks — carries a fixed-size header in its first
//! [`HEADER_LEN`] bytes. The header makes a block self-describing: it records
//! what the block *is* (`magic`, [`BlockType`], format version), which volume
//! and object it belongs to (filesystem UUID, owner object, generation),
//! where it is meant to live (its logical and physical address), and a keyed
//! authenticator over the identity plus the payload.
//!
//! Decoding verifies all of that against the address the reader *expected*,
//! so a stale, misdirected, wrong-type, torn, or bit-rotted block is rejected
//! at decode time and the caller fails closed rather than
//! trusting corrupt bytes.
//!
//! # Authenticator
//!
//! The block is sealed with an HMAC-SHA256 keyed authenticator
//! ([`mac_tag`]) computed through `lib/crypto` (crypto is
//! the standing "don't roll your own" exception). The tag covers every byte
//! of the block except the tag slot itself, so it authenticates the identity
//! (type, UUID, owner, generation, logical and physical address, payload
//! length) *and* the payload (`docs/src/filesystem/arxfs-spec.md` §8). A
//! block that fails the keyed check — because it is stale, misdirected, torn,
//! bit-rotted, or sealed under a different key — does not decode, and the
//! caller falls back to the block's redundant copy
//! ([`crate::ARXFS::read_meta`]).
