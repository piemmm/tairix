//! TAIRiX native filesystem driver (`arxfs`).
//!
//! `arxfs` is the native TAIRiX filesystem: a block-backed, copy-on-write
//! filesystem that stores full POSIX metadata plus an inline access-control
//! list and an optional capability gate **per inode**. It
//! sits behind any [`tairix_abi::driver::block::Block`] device and exposes
//! itself through the versioned [`FilesystemRead`] / [`FilesystemWrite`] /
//! [`FilesystemSecurity`] surfaces (new behaviour ships as a new trait, never by widening the
//! frozen mount/unmount [`Filesystem`](tairix_abi::driver::filesystem::Filesystem)).
//! It reports creation, modification, and metadata-change timestamps through
//! [`NodeInfo::times`](tairix_abi::driver::filesystem::NodeInfo::times); it
//! deliberately does **not** track access time (atime), reporting
//! [`Time64::UNIX_EPOCH`] for it.
//!
//! # Crash consistency (copy-on-write + superblock ring)
//!
//! Every mutation is a transaction. Modified metadata and data are written
//! **copy-on-write** to freshly allocated blocks — a block reachable from the
//! last committed transaction root is never overwritten in place — and the
//! transaction publishes a new root through a ring of superblock slots. The
//! commit order (`transaction` module) is: write the copy-on-write blocks,
//! write the new transaction root carrying its commit record, then publish the
//! next superblock-ring slot pointing at that root. A crash before the slot is
//! published leaves the previous committed root selected; `open` scans the ring
//! and selects the highest-generation slot whose root validates, so a mount
//! after a power loss lands on a whole transaction boundary, never a torn one.
//!
//! Every metadata block is self-identifying (`header` module): it carries its
//! type, the volume UUID, a generation, and its expected address under a
//! checksum, so a stale, misdirected, wrong-type, or torn block is rejected at
//! decode time (fail closed).
//!
//! # Public surface
//!
//! Per the only public *function* is [`register`]. [`ARXFS`]
//! is a public *type* the driver host instantiates with [`ARXFS::format`] /
//! [`ARXFS::open`].
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! Loading requires
//! [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`](tairix_abi::CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD). The driver
//! runs in user space; it does not request `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`.
