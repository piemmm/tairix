//! TAIRiX Broadcom GENET v5 link-layer network driver (Raspberry Pi 4B
//! on-board gigabit Ethernet).
//!
//! The Pi 4's `brcm,bcm2711-genet-v5` MAC is a DMA-mastering gigabit
//! controller with an embedded MDIO master driving an external RGMII PHY
//! (a BCM54213PE). This driver brings it up over the single register
//! aperture the discovered hardware-tree node names and serves frames
//! through [`tairix_abi::driver::net::Net`], so the network stack drives it
//! exactly as it drives any other NIC.
//!
//! # Layered seams
//!
//! The device logic is written against two injected seams, so the whole
//! bring-up and frame path is proven host-side against a register-level
//! model of the controller:
//!
//! * [`GenetRegs`] — register access (a capability-gated
//!   [`RegisterWindow`] on metal, a mock controller in tests). Both methods
//!   take `&mut self` so a model can represent registers with read side
//!   effects (the MDIO busy bit, the DMA producer indices).
//! * [`Delay`] — microsecond delay and monotonic time, so every hardware
//!   handshake is bounded by wall clock and the CPU sleeps between polls
//!   rather than spinning.
//!
//! QEMU models no GENET, so there is no emulated vertical for this device;
//! the register-level suite in `tests.rs` is the coverage and the live path
//! is an on-metal acceptance item (`plans/PI.md`).
//!
//! # Frame path
//!
//! Descriptors live in the controller's own on-chip RAM inside the register
//! aperture, so the only DMA is the frame buffers: one
//! [`DmaLayout`]-sized carve holds one receive and one transmit buffer of
//! [`BUF_LEN`] bytes per programmed descriptor, allocated **once**
//! at [`Genet::open`] and reused for every frame — no per-packet carve, no
//! allocator on the hot path.
//!
//! [`Net::service`] is a non-blocking doorbell: it reclaims completed
//! transmits, drains the ring's queued frames into free transmit slots, and
//! harvests delivered frames, then returns. It never waits for the device,
//! so it is safe to serve across the process boundary the network stack
//! calls over. A full receive ring is reported as back-pressure
//! ([`ServiceReport::rx_ring_full`]) with the frame left in its descriptor —
//! nothing is dropped behind the stack's back.
//!
//! # Offloads
//!
//! **Receive checksum.** `RBUF_RXCHK_EN` puts the checksum engine in front of
//! the receiver; it parses the frame's L3/L4 headers and reports its verdict
//! in bit 15 of the completed descriptor. The frame itself is untouched, so
//! the 64-byte receive status block (`RBUF_64B_EN` in the reference driver)
//! is deliberately **not** enabled and the receive-buffer layout is
//! exactly what it was without the offload. A frame the engine verified is
//! delivered as [`FrameOffload::Validated`]; anything it did not parse simply
//! keeps the stack's software fold.
//!
//! **Transmit checksum.** `TBUF_64B_EN` prefixes every transmitted buffer
//! with a [`regs::TSB_LEN`]-byte status block whose one live word directs the
//! engine at the transport checksum the stack left partial. The block is
//! consumed by the controller and never reaches the wire.
//!
//! **Segmentation.** The GENET has no segmentation engine, so the driver
//! splits a [`FrameOffload::TxSegment`] super-frame itself through the shared
//! [`TcpSegmenter`] and hands each wire segment to the
//! transmit checksum engine — the same shape Linux's `net/core/tso.c` gives
//! `mvneta` and `fec`. The win is the offload's real one: one ring slot and
//! one stack transmit pass for tens of packets. A super-frame the ring cannot
//! absorb in one doorbell stays staged and resumes at the next, so a full
//! ring defers segments rather than dropping them.
//!
//! # Public surface
//!
//! The only public *function* is [`register`]. [`Genet`] is a public type
//! the driver process instantiates through [`wiring::open_discovered`]; the
//! process never reaches into it beyond the [`Net`] trait.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! Loading requires [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`]; mapping the discovered
//! register window additionally requires [`CapabilityId::MMIO_MAP`] and
//! carving the frame buffers [`CapabilityId::MEM_DMA`] (both checked in
//! [`wiring`]). The driver runs in user space and does not request
//! `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`.
