//! Driver-host wiring: discovered BCM2711 PCIe controller → trained link.
//!
//! The aarch64 `FdtDiscovery` emits the `brcm,bcm2711-pcie` node into
//! `tairix_abi::hwtree` as a `Bus` node whose controller/ECAM-access
//! `reg` window and inbound-DMA aperture (`dma-ranges`) are
//! device-tree-discovered, never compiled-in (
//! `plans/PI.md` P10). A `devmgr`/host composition maps that window and
//! calls [`open_discovered`] to reset the root complex and train its
//! link; once it returns, the same register window is handed to
//! `tairix_pci::mechanism_brcm` to enumerate the VL805 xHCI
//! controller behind the bridge.
//!
//! This is the only seam that maps memory: [`open_discovered`] checks
//! [`CapabilityId::MMIO_MAP`], maps the controller window through the
//! host's [`MmioMapper`] (never a pointer the driver synthesises), and brings the link up over it. Everything below —
//! the reset/SerDes/window/link state machine — is the host-provable
//! [`BrcmPcieRc`] engine driven over the register seam.
//!
//! QEMU models no Pi PCIe link timing, so the
//! host tests prove the composition and its fail-closed paths up to the
//! root-port / link-up check; the live link training is the on-metal
//! acceptance item.
