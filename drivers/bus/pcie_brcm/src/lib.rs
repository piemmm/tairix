//! TAIRiX Broadcom BCM2711 (Raspberry Pi 4) PCIe root-complex bring-up.
//!
//! The Pi 4's VL805 xHCI controller hangs off the BCM2711 PCIe root
//! complex, which ships with its link **down**: reaching the VL805's
//! config space requires resetting the root complex, powering its SerDes,
//! programming its address windows, and training its link (`plans/PI.md`
//! P10). This crate performs that bring-up.
//!
//! This is the `lib` target of the BCM2711 PCIe bus driver crate, **not** a
//! `lib/*` crate. It is board-specific single-device support, but it lives
//! *in the driver* rather than under `lib/*`: the device-support
//! carve-out only permits a `lib/*` home when a charter-legal *non-driver*
//! consumer (a bootstrap-floor path, or a driver of a different class)
//! shares it, and a BCM2711 PCIe bus driver has none. PCIe root-complex
//! bring-up sits **above** the bootstrap floor (the kernel floor is the
//! storage path only — virtio-blk + EMMC2), so this engine's only consumer is
//! this crate's own `Run` binary (`src/main.rs`). It is therefore a
//! host-testable `lib` target the freestanding bin links, with no `lib/*`
//! device-support crate to keep in sync.
//! It names BCM2711 detail legitimately because that is its entire purpose;
//! nothing generic depends on it.
//!
//! # Layered seams
//!
//! The state machine ([`BrcmPcieRc`]) is written against two seams so it is
//! proven host-side:
//!
//! * [`RegisterBlock`] — register access (a capability-gated
//!   [`RegisterWindow`](tairix_abi::RegisterWindow) on metal, a
//!   register-level mock in tests).
//! * [`Delay`] — microsecond busy-delay for the link timing requirements
//!   (a generic-timer delay on metal, a no-op in tests).
//!
//! Once the link is up the register window is handed to
//! `tairix_pci::mechanism_brcm`; this crate never enumerates.
//!
//! # Public surface & capabilities
//!
//! The bring-up engine ([`BrcmPcieRc`], instantiated through
//! [`wiring::open_discovered`] / [`wiring::bring_up_from_node`]) and the
//! [`BIND_KEYS`] match table are the surface the `Run` binary drives.
//! [`register`] is the thin driver entry that checks
//! [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`] and touches no hardware. Mapping the
//! register window requires [`CapabilityId::MMIO_MAP`]. Runs in user
//! space (no `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`).
