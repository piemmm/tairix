//! Broadcom Serial Controller (BSC) I²C bus driver (`brcm,bcm2835-i2c`).
//!
//! The BSC is the I²C master the whole Raspberry Pi family exposes: a
//! 16-byte FIFO, a slave-address register, a transfer-length register, and a
//! status register whose bits drive one maskable interrupt. This crate is the
//! controller logic — the register sequence one transfer runs — with the
//! process, the endpoints, and the grants left to the `Run` binary.
//!
//! # Public surface
//!
//! [`register`] is the driver entry point every driver crate exposes.
//! [`Bsc`] is the controller, and [`Bsc::port`] narrows it to one child's
//! [`I2cPort`] — the shape a chip driver's requests are served against, with
//! the address coming from the bus driver's own duty grant rather than from
//! the wire.
//!
//! # Interrupt-driven, with a liveness backstop
//!
//! A transfer arms the controller and then **parks** on its interrupt line
//! through the injected [`BusWait`] seam: the FIFO-service and completion
//! interrupts are what advance it, never a spin. The per-phase deadline
//! exists only to catch a controller that has stopped answering — a slave that legitimately stretches the clock is bounded by
//! the controller's own stretch-timeout register, which raises its own status
//! bit long before the deadline could fire.
//!
//! # What this controller cannot do
//!
//! The BSC cannot emit a true repeated START: it drops a STOP between the two
//! phases of a write-then-read. On a single-master bus — which is what a
//! board wiring an RTC to the Pi's BSC has — that is indistinguishable, since
//! nothing else can move a chip's register pointer between the phases; a
//! multi-master bus is out of scope for this controller.
//!
//! The clock divider is left exactly as the firmware programmed it. The bus
//! speed is a property of the board's wiring and the slowest part on it, and
//! nothing in discovery tells a driver either, so overriding it could clock a
//! part past its rating.
//!
//! Reference: BCM2835 ARM Peripherals, §3 (BSC).
