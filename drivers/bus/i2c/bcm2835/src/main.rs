//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the Broadcom Serial Controller I²C bus
//! driver, installed as a signed `/System/Drivers/` bundle and **autoloaded
//! into user space** by `devmgr` when a `brcm,bcm2835-i2c` node is discovered
//! (`plans/TIMESYNC.md` TS-4).
//!
//! The process owns the controller's register window and its interrupt line,
//! and serves **one transfer endpoint per child the device tree declared**.
//! Discovery split the two halves of each child's existence: this driver
//! received the *duty* — an endpoint id paired with that child's bus address —
//! while the chip's own driver received only the *authority*, an endpoint
//! grant naming the id. The address therefore lives only here, so a chip
//! driver cannot reach a neighbour however it is compromised, and the kernel
//! admits this bind only because the duty grant covers the id.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program linking the Rust userland runtime
//! `tairix-rt`, never the C ABI. `main` wires the real seams:
//!
//! * `RtDriverHost::from_grants_query` over `RtGrantSyscalls`: the register
//!   window, the interrupt line, and the duty list all come from the grants
//!   the kernel minted for the matched node.
//! * `host.bind_irq()` before the first transfer, so a transfer parks on the
//!   line rather than spinning — a bind that fails ends the driver rather
//!   than degrading to a poll loop.
//! * one `call_create` per duty, then a wait-set over every bound endpoint,
//!   so the process parks between requests.
//!
//! A bring-up failure exits with a reserved fail-closed code, leaving the bus
//! unserved rather than the machine wedged. On the host it is an inert stub
//! so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and fmt still cover the file.
