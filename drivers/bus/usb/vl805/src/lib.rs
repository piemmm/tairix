//! TAIRiX Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711) VL805 xHCI USB host-controller
//! device-support library.
//!
//! The Pi 4's USB-A ports hang off a VIA VL805 PCIe-to-USB3 xHCI host
//! controller behind the BCM2711 PCIe root complex. On boards without the
//! SPI EEPROM (Pi 4 rev 1.4 and later) the VL805 has **no resident
//! firmware**: the `VideoCore` co-processor loads it at power-on, and a
//! PCIe `PERST#` (which the root-complex bring-up asserts) drops it. Only
//! the `VideoCore` can (re)load it, over a firmware property-channel
//! `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` request (`plans/PI.md` P10).
//!
//! That firmware reload is the **one** thing specific to *this device*. It
//! is therefore its own driver, separate from the generic PCIe root-complex
//! driver (`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm`, which trains the link) and the generic
//! xHCI host-controller engine (`lib/usb`, which brings the controller up
//! and enumerates devices). None of those is a part of another: a different
//! board may need the PCIe driver without USB at all, or an xHCI controller
//! that needs no firmware reload. Keeping them separate is the correct
//! modular shape.
//!
//! # Why this lives in the driver crate, not `lib/*`
//!
//! This is the VL805's device-specific firmware-reload policy and the
//! controller-node wiring: pure driver logic. It is **not** in a `lib/*`
//! crate, because the device-support carve-out only permits that when a
//! *charter-legal non-driver* consumer (a bootstrap-floor path, or a
//! driver of a different class) shares it — and this driver has none. A VL805
//! USB driver sits **above** the bootstrap floor (it is discovered and
//! autoloaded into user space), so the firmware policy's only consumer
//! is this crate's own `Run` binary. The logic therefore lives here, in the
//! driver, as a host-testable `lib` target the freestanding bin links — there
//! is no second crate and no `lib/*` device-support crate to keep in sync.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! The crate may know the VL805/BCM2711, but it reaches the firmware mailbox
//! **only** through the board-neutral
//! [`MailboxChannel`] seam the
//! host exposes — never a doorbell address, a property-buffer carve, or a
//! `kernel/*` dependency. The board specifics (doorbell
//! window, DMA-aliased buffer, cache coherency) stay behind the host's
//! `MailboxChannel` implementation and the `VideoCore` client
//! (`lib/vcmailbox`). The property-message *layout* lives once in
//! `lib/vcmailbox` ([`encode_xhci_reset`] and friends); this crate only
//! sequences the policy.
//!
//! # Public surface & capabilities
//!
//! Per the only public *function* is [`register`]; the
//! firmware policy is exposed as [`reload_firmware`] and
//! [`probe_firmware_revision`], composed by the host over a
//! [`MailboxChannel`]. The
//! [`wiring`] module composes the firmware reload with publishing the
//! controller as an xHCI hardware-tree node. Loading requires
//! [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`]; the mailbox doorbell/buffer access is gated
//! host-side by the `MailboxChannel` implementation. Runs
//! in user space (no `CAP_DRV_KERNEL`).
