//! Arch-neutral xHCI controller bring-up orchestration for the HCD process
//! (`plans/USB.md` U3b).
//!
//! This is the composition the **host-controller driver** runs at start-up: it
//! brings the controller up over the device-resource grants the kernel minted
//! for it (its already-assigned register BAR and a DMA constraint) and returns
//! the [`UsbDevice`] enumeration engine. The engine is pointed at the attached
//! device's slot when one is present, or left serving with its first-connect
//! watch armed when none is (a keyboard absent at boot is a first-class state,
//! not a failure).
//! The HCD then serves that device's transfers over the URB transport seam
//! (`tairix_usb::transport`) to the autoloaded class driver — it does **not**
//! decode HID reports itself; that is the class driver's job.
//!
//! # What lives here, and what does not
//!
//! The HCD is **arch-neutral**: the board PCIe root-complex bring-up and BAR
//! assignment stay in the separate board bus drivers (`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm` +
//! `drivers/bus/usb/vl805`), which assign the controller's BAR and emit the
//! enumerated controller as the `usb,xhci` node carrying the BAR + DMA + IRQ
//! grants. This HCD is autoloaded against that node, granted *only* the
//! resources it requested, and reaches them through the [`DriverHost`] its
//! runtime builds over those grants. So this orchestration knows nothing of
//! PCI, the BCM2711, or any board: it maps a register window by address,
//! carves a DMA region, and speaks the bus-agnostic xHCI protocol in
//! [`tairix_usb`].
//!
//! # Testing boundary
//!
//! QEMU models no Pi USB timing, so the host tests prove the composition and
//! its fail-closed paths up to the controller hand-off; over an inert mock
//! register window [`Xhci::open`] fails closed with
//! [`DriverError::DeviceFault`], which is exactly the on-metal boundary. The
//! live controller bring-up is the on-metal acceptance item.
