//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the USB **host-controller driver** (HCD),
//! installed as a signed `/System/Drivers/` bundle and autoloaded into user
//! space by `devmgr` when an `usb,xhci` controller node is discovered
//! (`plans/USB.md` U3b).
//!
//! This process is the **sole owner** of one xHCI controller: it maps the
//! controller's register BAR, owns its DMA rings and root-hub ports, brings
//! it up, and enumerates the attached device. It then **publishes one
//! hardware-tree node per USB interface** (carrying the device's
//! `vid:pid:class` match keys) so `devmgr` autoloads the matching **class**
//! driver (`drivers/input/usb_kbd`, …), and **serves that class driver's URB
//! transfers** over the bus-agnostic URB transport seam. It names no class
//! driver, no board, and no private bus implementation.
//!
//! It holds no class-specific authority: the keyboard driver decodes reports
//! and injects keystrokes; this HCD only moves bytes between the controller
//! and the shared buffer.
//!
//! # The asynchronous event loop (`plans/USB.md` §1.1)
//!
//! The HCD multiplexes two independent event streams on one kernel **wait-set**
//! (`U3a3`) so it never busy-polls and never blocks one interface inside
//! another's handler (the charter forbids spinning a core):
//!
//! * **A URB-submit IPC call** on the per-interface endpoint it serves: it
//!   `call_recv`s the URB and drives it. An interrupt-IN report not yet
//!   arrived is left **outstanding** (the class driver's `ipc_call` parks in
//!   the kernel); a control transfer or a ready report is replied at once.
//! * **The controller's completion interrupt**: *acknowledge, drain once, then
//!   dispatch*. The acknowledgement's single `USBSTS` read carries the fault and
//!   port-change latches, so the whole service needs no second read of it. Then
//!   one pass over the event ring (`UsbDevice::pump_reports`) sorts every posted
//!   event into its consumer's buffer — each served interrupt-IN endpoint's
//!   reports into its per-device FIFO with the endpoint re-armed, each watched
//!   hub's status-change report into its parked slot, bulk completions into
//!   their FIFOs, a Port Status Change Event into the root-scan arming.
//!   Everything after that reads those buffers rather than walking the ring
//!   again: hot-plug is serviced, then any now-satisfiable outstanding URB is
//!   **replied** from the buffered report, bounce-copied into the shared buffer
//!   the class driver reads.
//!
//!   Capturing on the interrupt rather than only when a class driver submits
//!   decouples device polling from a CPU-starved class driver, so reports are
//!   never dropped under load (`plans/USB.md`). It also watches the root-hub
//!   port and retracts the interface node on a disconnect (`hw_remove_node`),
//!   so `devmgr` unloads the class driver while the controller stays up.
//!
//! # Per-interrupt cost
//!
//! A device streaming reports — a mouse in motion, at the 1 ms
//! interrupt-moderation ceiling — makes this path run ~1000 times a second, so
//! what it touches per pass is the driver's whole steady-state CPU cost. Three
//! properties keep it small, each with a budget regression in `lib/usb`:
//!
//! * **One register read.** The port scan is armed by a latched event rather
//!   than run unconditionally, and the fault check rides the acknowledgement's
//!   own read. On a PCIe controller a register read is a non-posted round trip
//!   and is the most expensive operation here.
//! * **One TRB per ring probe.** The engine reads the single 16-byte entry at
//!   the dequeue point, never the whole segment out of non-cacheable memory.
//! * **No allocation.** The path holds only fixed-capacity state; the heap is
//!   touched on attach and detach alone.
//!
//! # Data path (`plans/USB.md` U3a2, Option B)
//!
//! The URB data buffer is a cross-process **shared-memory** region this HCD
//! creates (`shm_create`) for each interface node it publishes, and no other
//! node ever carries, forwarded as a grant on that node; the class driver
//! inherits the grant and `shm_map`s the same frames. The buffer is plain
//! cacheable RAM with no DMA properties — the class driver holds **zero** DMA
//! authority — and the HCD bounce-copies between it and its own DMA-granted
//! ring.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: it links the Rust userland
//! runtime `tairix-rt` (`_start`, the stack canary, the panic handler, the
//! syscall wrappers); on the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build
//! --workspace`, clippy, and fmt still cover the file. The live controller
//! bring-up and report path are metal-only because QEMU models no Pi USB; the
//! HCD's host-testable logic lives in the crate's `lib` target
//! ([`tairix_drv_bus_usb::bringup`], [`tairix_drv_bus_usb::serve`],
//! [`tairix_drv_bus_usb::interfaces`]).
