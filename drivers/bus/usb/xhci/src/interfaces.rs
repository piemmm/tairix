//! The interface nodes the HCD publishes and the URB transports they ride.
//!
//! Each served interface gets a node carrying a transport: a call endpoint
//! its class driver submits URBs on and a shared buffer the data moves
//! through. A node is kept while the device it was built from is served,
//! wherever the device table now places it — the Linux USB core's
//! reset-and-verify rule (`usb_reset_and_verify_device`). A node id is never
//! reissued, so keeping the node is what lets a device survive a controller
//! reset with its driver bound.
//!
//! A node's buffer is created for it and carried by no other: the kernel
//! retires every region a removed node conferred, and a fresh region holds
//! nothing of another device's. Endpoints are reused. A removed node's grant
//! to one is revoked with it, and whatever its driver queued before that is
//! answered `NotFound` before the endpoint carries another node.
