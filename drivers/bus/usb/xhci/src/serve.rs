//! The HCD's per-interface URB-service state machine and interface-node
//! builder (`plans/USB.md` §1.1, §1.3 — the asynchronous event loop).
//!
//! The host-controller driver serves one URB transport call endpoint per USB
//! interface it emits. A class driver submits an interrupt-IN URB (a blocking
//! `ipc_call`) to read the next report; the HCD does **not** reply until the
//! controller's completion interrupt delivers that report, so the class driver
//! parks in the kernel rather than busy-polling (the charter forbids spinning
//! a core). [`UrbService`] is the per-interface state that makes this work: it
//! holds at most one outstanding URB and drives it on the controller event.
//!
//! The data path is the U3a2 shared-memory buffer: the report bytes the
//! controller wrote into the HCD's own DMA ring are copied into the shared
//! buffer (the `shm` slice here — the HCD's mapping of the region the class
//! driver also maps) by the engine's [`interrupt_in`](UrbEngine::interrupt_in),
//! and the class driver reads them from its own mapping. The class driver
//! holds no DMA grant.
//!
//! This module is pure and alloc-free, so it is proven host-side over a mock
//! [`UrbEngine`]; the live wait-set loop that drives it is in `main.rs` and is
//! the on-metal acceptance item (QEMU models no Pi USB).
