//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the virtio sound driver, installed as a
//! signed `/System/Drivers/` bundle and **autoloaded into user space** by
//! `devmgr` when a virtio-snd device is discovered (`plans/SOUND.md` SND4).
//!
//! This is the "drivers in user space" steady state for audio: the process
//! owns the device (its register window, DMA, and interrupt line) and serves
//! the `audiochan-v1` device-channel contract to the mixer service
//! (`userland/system/audiod`), which runs in its own address space and owns
//! the shared PCM regions. The two never link each other — the driver is the
//! *server* of a claimed reserved endpoint and the mixer is the one *client*
//! the kernel admits — so any audio driver serves any mixer build. Nothing
//! about sound is in the kernel.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt`, never the C ABI (which exists solely for
//! non-Rust programs). It links no `drivers/*` crate — the virtio transport
//! and the device-channel serve loop are `lib/*` crates and the device engine
//! is this crate's own `lib` target — so the layering holds.
//!
//! # What `main` does
//!
//! 1. Builds the rt-backed `RtDriverHost` from the grants the kernel minted
//!    for this driver's matched node (a register window, a DMA constraint,
//!    and the device interrupt line — and no more).
//! 2. Binds the granted interrupt line the serve loop parks on.
//! 3. Brings the device online over the bus-agnostic virtio transport,
//!    shape-keyed by the grant set so one signed bundle binds on either bus.
//! 4. Hands the opened device to `tairix_audiochan::serve`, the shared
//!    device-channel serve loop every audio driver process runs: it claims a
//!    reserved endpoint bound restricted-sender on `CAP_AUDIO_DEVICE`,
//!    publishes the `audiochan` node `devmgr` hands to the mixer, and parks
//!    on {call endpoint, device IRQ} for the life of the driver.
//!
//! A bring-up failure exits with a reserved fail-closed code
//! (`tairix_audiochan::exit`), leaving the machine without sound rather than
//! wedged; the spawning supervisor decides whether to relaunch. On the host
//! it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and fmt still
//! cover the file.
