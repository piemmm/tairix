//! TAIRiX virtio sound driver (`plans/SOUND.md` SND4).
//!
//! The device logic of a virtio sound device (virtio 1.2 §5.14, device type
//! 25), implementing [`Audio`] over the bus-agnostic split-virtqueue
//! transport in `lib/virtio`. It is the first audio driver and the one that
//! gives an end-to-end QEMU vertical on every Tier-1 architecture, so it is
//! the device the whole stack is proved against before a second one exists.
//!
//! This crate has two targets. The host-testable device engine
//! ([`VirtioSnd`]), the [`BIND_KEYS`] match table and the [`register`] entry
//! are the `lib` target, co-located *in the driver* because a sound card sits
//! well above the bootstrap floor and so has no charter-legal non-driver
//! consumer. `src/main.rs` is the `Run` binary the signed bundle installs.
//!
//! # The device, and what this driver does with it
//!
//! Four virtqueues: a control queue carrying request/response pairs, an event
//! queue the device posts jack and stream notifications on, and a transmit
//! and receive queue carrying PCM payloads. Bring-up reads the device's own
//! configuration (how many jacks, streams and channel maps it presents), then
//! enumerates each with an information request — so what this driver reports
//! is what the device said, never a table keyed on what it claims to be.
//!
//! A stream is programmed with `SET_PARAMS` and `PREPARE`, clocked with
//! `START`, and torn down with `STOP` and `RELEASE`. Payload moves one period
//! at a time: a period's worth of frames is copied out of the mixer's shared
//! ring into one of this driver's own DMA buffers and posted on the transmit
//! queue (or the reverse, on the receive queue). The copy is the point — the
//! DMA window stays this process's alone.
//!
//! # The position never lies
//!
//! A playback stream that is running must be fed every period or the device
//! glitches unpredictably. When the mixer's ring is short, this driver
//! submits **silence for exactly the frames it is missing** and adds them to
//! the stream's loss tally, so the frame position stays exact and the mixer
//! learns precisely what was lost rather than drifting. The device's own
//! `latency_bytes` is subtracted from the submitted total, so the reported
//! position is what has been clocked out rather than what has been handed
//! over.
//!
//! # Nothing spins
//!
//! The driver's serve loop (`lib/audiochan`) parks on the device interrupt;
//! this engine only ever drains what the device has already completed.
//! Control requests are the one bounded exception the silicon dictates: the
//! mixer's call is synchronous, so a control response is waited for on the
//! host's interrupt park with the device's own deadline, never polled.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! Loading requires [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`]. The process reaches its
//! hardware through the resource grants its matched node requested, and
//! nothing here grants itself authority.
