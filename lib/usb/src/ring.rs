//! xHCI ring state machines (xHCI 1.2 §4.9).
//!
//! Two ring shapes exist: **producer** rings the driver writes and the
//! controller consumes (the command ring and every transfer ring), and
//! the **event** ring the controller writes and the driver consumes.
//! Ownership of each slot is handed over by the cycle bit (§4.9.2):
//! the producer stamps its current cycle state into each TRB it
//! enqueues, the consumer processes TRBs whose cycle bit matches its
//! own state, and each pass over the ring inverts the expectation.
//!
//! The state machines below hold no memory: the producer ring returns
//! the stamped TRBs to publish and the event cursor consumes from a
//! caller-provided snapshot. The owner of the device-shared memory —
//! on metal a capability-granted DMA region, in host tests a plain
//! buffer — performs every read and write, so the cycle/wrap/full
//! logic is proven host-side without hardware and
//! DMA publication (cache cleaning, address translation, write
//! ordering) stays with the seam that owns the memory.
