//! xHCI device enumeration (xHCI 1.2 §4.3) and the transfer paths it serves.
//!
//! [`UsbDevice`] drives one controller through the bring-up of attached
//! devices — port reset, Enable Slot, Address Device, the device and
//! configuration descriptors, Configure Endpoint and `SET_CONFIGURATION` —
//! and then serves each interface's interrupt-IN, bulk and control transfers
//! through its [`DeviceEngine`] over the URB transport. It knows no device
//! class: a class driver reads its own descriptors and drives its own class
//! requests, inside the [`crate::transport::UrbScope`] of its interface.
//!
//! # Memory seam
//!
//! Every byte the controller shares with the driver lives in a growable,
//! caller-provided bank of DMA chunks behind the [`DmaBank`] trait — on
//! metal the [`crate::SlabBank`] over capability-granted slabs, in host
//! tests a plain shared buffer — so the enumeration state machine is
//! proven host-side against the register-level mock plus an in-memory
//! ring model. The controller's shared structures live in one chunk sized
//! exactly to the silicon's reported geometry; every device and hub gets
//! its own chunk on attach and returns it on detach, so concurrency is
//! bounded by the controller's slots and genuine memory exhaustion, never
//! a compile-time budget. The engine performs every ring read/write
//! through the seam; the ring state machines themselves hold no
//! memory ([`ProducerRing`], [`EventRingCursor`]).
