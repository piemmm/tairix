# tairix-parallel

Stability tier: **experimental**

How a pass hands the machine's other cores work it has already proved
independent. Nothing here discovers independence — that is the caller's proof,
and the caller keeps it.

## What it provides

- `JobRunner` — the contract a pass expresses its independent work through.
  `unsafe`, because `for_each` turns an index into an exclusive borrow and
  therefore depends on two memory-safety obligations: each index is run at most
  once and never concurrently with itself, and `run` does not return until every
  invocation it made has returned.
- `Serial` / `SERIAL` — the runner that runs every job on the calling thread. Not
  a stub: it is the correct runner wherever there is no second core, no thread to
  create (an in-kernel consumer), or no reason to hand work off. A pass written
  against `JobRunner` is complete with only this.
- `for_each` — the one place an index becomes `&mut items[i]`, and the crate's
  single `unsafe` block. A pass splits its output into disjoint pieces
  (`split_at_mut` / `chunks_mut`), hands the slice here, and gets each piece
  visited exactly once.
- `for_each_drawn` / `fold_drawn` — the same visit for pieces an iterator
  splits off one borrow at a time (row bands, parts of differing lengths):
  participants draw them from the iterator under a `lib/sync` spin lock held
  only for the draw, so a dispatch gathers them into no list and allocates
  nothing. `fold_drawn` joins each visit's answer in the order visits finish.
- `bands` — the one split policy: how many pieces `units` units of work should
  become, given how few units are worth a hand-off. Work below one piece's worth
  answers `1`, so a small repaint runs its plain loop with no atomics and no
  syscall.
- `Pool` (default feature `pool`) — the fork-join worker pool over `lib/rt`
  threads. `Pool::for_cpus(online)` is the sizing policy: one participant per
  discovered online CPU, of which the dispatching thread is one, so a single-CPU
  machine creates no thread at all.

## Design notes

- **Nothing spins.** An idle worker is parked in `futex_wait` on the dispatch
  epoch; a dispatcher with pieces still in flight is parked in `futex_wait` on
  the claim word. An idle pool costs the address space its workers' stacks
  reserve and no CPU. The one spin is `for_each_drawn`'s, on a lock held only
  for one draw from the pieces' iterator.
- **The dispatch lives on the dispatcher's stack.** It is published as an erased
  pointer, and a worker reaches it only through a draw that took a piece of the
  work *and* a hold on the dispatch in one atomic. Both halves live in one
  word — the pieces left to hand out and the workers still reading — so the
  dispatcher can never observe "no pieces left and no holders" while a worker is
  still reading, and waiting for the holders to reach zero once the pieces run
  out is exactly the condition "no worker holds the pointer".
- **A dispatch costs what its work costs, not what scheduling costs.** A hold
  taken *before* the work is known makes a dispatch's latency the time for the
  scheduler to run a woken worker to completion whether or not it got any work,
  which is unbounded where runnable threads outnumber cores: measured at 429 ms
  of compositing on a four-core board when the barrier was over every worker,
  and still 992 ms once it had been narrowed to the workers that registered — a
  worker is woken by every dispatch, so it does reach a CPU, take its hold and
  then risk preemption. Taking the hold *with* the piece removes the case: a
  worker that finds the pieces exhausted touches nothing, holds nothing and parks
  again, so the dispatcher never waits for it however long it is descheduled. No
  parallelism is given up, because a worker is refused only when there is no
  piece left to give it.
- **Pieces run from the top down.** The count must live in the same word as the
  hold — a second atomic holding it would let a worker pair one dispatch's count
  with a later dispatch's word and draw an out-of-range index — so a draw yields
  `remaining - 1`. `JobRunner` contracts that the order is not observable and
  `Reversed` holds consumers to it.
- **It cannot deadlock.** A dispatch that finds one already in flight — nested
  inside a piece of it, or issued from another thread — runs its work on the
  calling thread. There is no arrangement of callers that waits on the pool.
- **It degrades rather than fails.** A thread the kernel refuses (the `threads`
  rlimit, exhausted memory) is simply not created; the pool runs with what it
  got, and `worker_count` reports it so a caller can say so.
- **Oversubscription is deliberate.** Pieces are claimed dynamically and the
  split is finer than the runner is wide, because the case that bites on a loaded
  machine is a core taken by another tenant: with one piece each, the whole pass
  waits for the straggler; with several, the others absorb its share.

## Capacity

Worker count is derived from the discovered online CPU count, never a constant,
and the per-dispatch split is derived from the runner's width and the caller's
grain. There is no fixed ceiling on pieces, work units, or dispatches.

## Testing

`Reversed` (feature `test-util`) is the runner every consumer proves bit-identity
against: it reports a width it does not have and runs its pieces backwards on the
calling thread, so a comparison against `SERIAL` is a proof about how a pass
*divides* rather than about thread timing. It lives here because the `unsafe impl`
belongs beside the trait whose obligations it discharges, and because three
crates were otherwise spelling the same eight lines.

Host tests cover the pure half: the split policy at and around its boundaries,
`for_each` visiting each element exactly once, that the order pieces run in
cannot change the result, the unvisited-element case a skipping runner produces,
drawn pieces visited once by every runner and folded with every answer joined
once, the no-worker degradation, and nested dispatch. The host has no syscall trap, so
a pool there has no workers by construction; the concurrent protocol is exercised
by the desktop's per-architecture QEMU verticals, which composite through a real
multi-worker pool.
