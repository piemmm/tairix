//! Bounded data-parallel work: how a pass hands the machine's other cores the
//! work it has already proved independent.
//!
//! A pass that has split its output into pieces no two of which read or write
//! the same byte — a compositor's row bands, a blur's column sub-bands — states
//! that by handing the pieces here. Nothing in this crate discovers
//! independence; it is the caller's proof, and the caller keeps it.
//!
//! # The three parts
//!
//! * [`JobRunner`] — the contract. A pass names it, so the pass compiles and
//!   runs without a thread anywhere near it: [`Serial`] is a runner, and it is
//!   the whole of what an in-kernel or single-core consumer links.
//! * [`for_each`] — the one place an index becomes an element. A runner deals
//!   in indices because that is all it can share between threads; a pass wants
//!   its own `&mut` piece. That conversion is the crate's single `unsafe`
//!   block, and it lives here rather than in every pass.
//! * [`Pool`] (feature `pool`) — the fork-join worker pool over `lib/rt`
//!   threads. Workers park on a futex between dispatches and never spin.
//!
//! # Sizing
//!
//! [`bands`] is the one split policy. A caller says how many units of work it
//! has and how few units are worth a hand-off; the answer is how many pieces to
//! make. Work below one piece's worth runs on the calling thread with no
//! atomics and no syscall, so a small repaint costs exactly what it did before
//! a pool existed.
//!
//! [`Pool`]: pool::Pool
