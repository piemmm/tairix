//! Bus-aware `reg` decoding: the ancestor-bus state every device-tree
//! consumer needs to turn a node's raw `reg` into a CPU-physical window.
//!
//! Real boards put peripherals behind buses carrying their own
//! `#address-cells`/`#size-cells` and `ranges` (the Pi 4's `/soc`, a PCIe
//! root complex), so a raw `reg` read is a *bus* address, never the address
//! a driver may map. Decoding it needs per-depth state the plain node
//! iterator does not carry, which is what this module adds: [`BusLevel`]
//! tracking, the ancestor-chain [`translate`] step, the per-entry
//! [`translated_reg`] reader, the `dma-ranges` and PCI outbound-window
//! decoders, and the early-returning [`scan_translated`] walk.
//!
//! It is pure Devicetree spec v0.4 §2.3 address translation, so it lives
//! beside the parser rather than in any one architecture port: every
//! FDT-based port decodes `reg` the same way, and only the interrupt
//! specifier differs.
