//! Ergonomic userland I/O over the `abi-v1` descriptor table.
//!
//! This is the TAIRiX counterpart of `std::io`: one fd-generic
//! [`Read`]/[`Write`] trait pair, the buffering ([`BufReader`], [`BufWriter`])
//! and formatting built on them, and the four well-known standard streams
//! ([`Stdin`], [`Stdout`], [`Stderr`], [`StdInfo`]). It is a pure-Rust layer
//! over the existing `stream_read` / `stream_write` traps: it adds **no**
//! syscall, capability, or `lib/abi` type, and reaches no authority a program
//! does not already hold — an I/O object only ever names a descriptor the
//! kernel already gave the process, never a device.
//!
//! # One vocabulary, no duplication
//!
//! Every text program in TAIRiX moves bytes through this one definition, so no
//! program re-implements the short-write loop or "read until newline" logic.
//! The standard streams and any pipe / tty / file / resource-reference fd a
//! sibling subsystem later opens are read and written through the **same**
//! traits: a [`Stream`] over an arbitrary fd shares the identical code path as
//! [`Stdout`].
//!
//! # Not the opener
//!
//! Obtaining a *new* fd (opening a file under a capability, resolving a
//! resource reference) is a capability-bearing operation owned by the
//! filesystem and resource-reference subsystems, not this layer. This module
//! constructs only the four inherited standard streams on its own; any other
//! fd is *handed in* by the owning subsystem's open/resolve call. It therefore
//! exposes no `open`/`resolve` and cannot widen authority.
//!
//! There is deliberately no *owning* stream handle here: [`crate::File`] is
//! the one owning descriptor handle, whatever its backing (a path, a resource
//! reference, a pipe end, a pty end) — the close trap releases any of them —
//! and it implements these same traits. A second owning fd type alongside it
//! would be the duplication this layer exists to prevent. [`Stream`] is the
//! *borrowed* view, for a descriptor whose lifetime someone else owns.
//!
//! # Fail closed, fail loud
//!
//! No path panics or uses `unwrap`/`expect`. A short read or write is a value
//! the provided helpers loop over, and a formatting failure surfaces as
//! [`Error::Fmt`]. A kernel refusal is surfaced as [`Error::Os`] carrying the
//! kernel's own [`Errno`] — never folded into a zero-length read, which would
//! make a revoked capability, a broken pipe, or a faulted buffer
//! indistinguishable from clean end-of-input and let a consumer silently
//! truncate what it read. `Ok(0)` from a read means end-of-input and nothing
//! else.
