//! A mapped shared-memory region, owned.
//!
//! [`shm_create`](crate::shm_create) hands back a raw base address and a
//! length, and every consumer that wants the bytes has to build the same
//! slice over them and unmap on the same paths. This is that, once: one
//! `unsafe` with one proof, and a `Drop` that cannot be forgotten.
//!
//! It is deliberately not window-, driver-, or protocol-specific: what a
//! region is *for* — which endpoint it is granted to, what is written into it
//! — belongs to the crate that knows, and this owns only the mapping.
//!
//! [`SharedRegion`] is a region this task **created**; [`MappedGrant`] is one
//! another task granted it. Both own a mapping and unmap on drop; they differ
//! only in where the mapping came from, and a grant carries no region id
//! because the holder is not the owner and may not re-grant it.
