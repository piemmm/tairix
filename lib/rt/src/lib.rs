//! `tairix-rt` — the pure-Rust userland runtime.
//!
//! This is the runtime a **first-party TAIRiX program written in Rust** links:
//! it provides the program's `_start` entry trampoline, idiomatic `abi-v1`
//! syscall wrappers, the [`entry!`] macro that names the program's `main`, and
//! the panic handler. TAIRiX is Rust-only, so its own
//! programs use this runtime and never the C ABI.
//!
//! # Relationship to the C ABI (`crt0` + `abi-sys`)
//!
//! `tairix-crt0` and `tairix-abi-sys` are the curated *System runtime / C ABI*
//! class: a libc-equivalent that exists **solely** so
//! a program **not** written in Rust (C, …) can call `abi-v1`. They are not
//! for TAIRiX's own code. `tairix-rt` is the Rust counterpart; both build on
//! the one shared syscall trap (`tairix-abi-trap`), so the
//! trap assembly is not duplicated.
//!
//! # Not a privileged path
//!
//! The wrappers add **no** authority. Every capability check and input
//! validation happens kernel-side, on the far side of the trap; a Rust program reaches no syscall it could not reach otherwise.
//!
//! # Using it
//!
//! A program is `#![no_std]`, `#![no_main]`, declares its `main`, and hands it
//! to [`entry!`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//!
//! fn main() -> i32 {
//!     tairix_rt::stream_write(b"hello\n");
//!     0
//! }
//!
//! tairix_rt::entry!(main);
//! ```
//!
//! `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, which validates the kernel-supplied
//! startup vector, installs the per-process stack canary,
//! calls `main`, and routes its return value through the `exit` syscall.
//!
//! # Targets
//!
//! The `_start` trampoline, stack-canary symbols, and panic handler are
//! compiled in only for the three native Tier-1 targets, gated on a
//! build-script-emitted `rt_native_<arch>` cfg (`build.rs`) rather than a
//! target-architecture predicate, so the instruction-set choice stays out of
//! the source tree the `cfg-check` guards. On the host only the
//! host-testable syscall-wrapper marshalling is compiled.
