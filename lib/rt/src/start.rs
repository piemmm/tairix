//! The per-architecture program entry trampoline (`_start`) — the
//! assembly carve-out — the Rust startup driver it calls, the stack-protector
//! symbols, and the panic handler.
//!
//! # Why this module contains assembly (justification)
//!
//! TAIRiX is Rust-only; assembly is permitted only where the architecture
//! *strictly* requires it. A program's entry point is exactly such a case:
//! when the kernel transfers control to `_start` there is no runtime yet —
//! the stack-pointer alignment a `call` boundary demands, and reading the
//! kernel-supplied startup-vector pointer out of the entry register, have no
//! Rust spelling. Each `_start` here does the minimum: align the stack, place
//! the startup-vector pointer in the integer-argument-0 register, and `call`
//! [`rust_rt_start`], which performs the rest in plain Rust.
//!
//! This is the Rust counterpart of `lib/crt0/src/start.rs`. Both reach the
//! kernel through the one shared trap (`tairix-abi-trap`); crt0 marshals the
//! startup vector into a C `argc`/`argv`/`envp` and calls a C `main`, whereas
//! this runtime calls the program's Rust `main` (named through
//! [`crate::entry!`]). TAIRiX's own programs use this runtime; crt0 exists
//! only for non-Rust programs.
//!
//! Each `_start` is gated on a build-script-emitted `rt_native_<arch>` cfg
//! (see `build.rs`) rather than a target-architecture predicate, so the
//! instruction-set choice stays out of the source tree the `cfg-check`
//! guards (mirroring `lib/crt0` and `lib/abi-trap`).
//!
//! # Kernel → `_start` contract (`abi-v1`)
//!
//! The kernel transfers control to the program's `_start` with the C
//! integer-argument-0 register holding the base address of the
//! position-independent startup-vector block ([`tairix_abi::process`]) and a
//! valid, writable stack (the register is `rdi` on x86_64, `x0` on aarch64,
//! `a0` on riscv64 — the first integer argument on each platform's C ABI).
