//! TAIRiX parser-sandbox seam (`lib/sandbox`).
//!
//! Every parser of untrusted input runs in a minimum-capability sandbox
//! process; the kernel primitive that creates such a process is the
//! `SPAWN_FLAG_SANDBOX` spawn mode (`docs/src/security/sandbox.md`). This
//! crate is the one user-space seam over that primitive — the typed
//! request/reply path every program that sandboxes a parse imports, so the
//! containment discipline is written once:
//!
//! * [`proto`] — the length-framed byte protocol over any [`proto::Channel`]
//!   (pipes in production, in-memory fakes in host tests), bounded by
//!   [`proto::MAX_FRAME`].
//! * [`worker`] — the serve loop the sandboxed process runs over a total
//!   [`worker::Service`].
//! * [`host`] — the calling program's side: [`host::ParserSandbox`] sends a
//!   request and contains every worker failure — typed error to the
//!   caller, the dead worker reaped and **replaced**, the event logged
//!   with a stable id ([`host::EVENT_WORKER_CRASHED`],
//!   [`host::EVENT_WORKER_UNAVAILABLE`]). A parser crash never takes down
//!   the calling program.
//! * [`helpdoc`] — a foreign bundle's help document is parsed and rendered
//!   inside the worker (`tairix-help`), and the caller-side
//!   [`helpdoc::render_help`] re-parses the reply through the `tairix-vt`
//!   streaming parser, admitting only the closed render-op set a help
//!   render can legitimately contain.
//! * [`session`] — the **duplex, long-lived** seam beside that one-shot
//!   pair: [`session::SandboxSession`] never blocks (the owner drives it
//!   from a wait-set over its two descriptors), many frames are in flight
//!   each way, and a failed worker ends the session rather than being
//!   replaced, because it held the protocol state
//!   ([`session::EVENT_SESSION_FAILED`]). The worker side
//!   ([`session::serve_session`]) stays a pure reactor, which is what the
//!   kernel's sandbox allow-list already forces it to be.
//! * [`supervise`] — the duplex seam for a worker whose state its owner can
//!   re-establish, such as a decoder of a stream of untrusted input:
//!   [`supervise::SupervisedSession`] replaces a failed worker, after a
//!   paced delay a crafted input cannot shorten, and reports each fresh one
//!   as a new generation.
//! * [`loopback`] — the public in-process fakes, so a consumer's host tests
//!   run the full parent path without processes (the `Fs`/`Tty` seam
//!   pattern) — [`loopback::LoopbackLauncher`] for the one-shot seam,
//!   [`loopback::LoopbackSession`] and
//!   [`loopback::LoopbackSessionLauncher`] for the duplex ones.
//! * [`decode`] — the first consumers behind the seam: executable-container
//!   summaries (`tairix-binfmt`) and instruction windows (`tairix-disasm`),
//!   with fail-closed reply validation (the worker is hostile once it has
//!   parsed a byte).
//! * [`imagerender`] — an application bundle's icon (SVG or PNG bytes) is
//!   sniffed, decoded, and rasterised inside the worker
//!   (`tairix-svg`/`tairix-image`/`tairix-icon`/`tairix-raster`), and the
//!   caller-side [`imagerender::rasterise_icon`] validates the reply's echoed
//!   side and pixel length before trusting the returned RGBA8 buffer. The
//!   same worker also places a desktop wallpaper
//!   (`tairix-image`/`tairix-wallpaper`/`tairix-raster`) across a
//!   prepare/band/release sequence, bounded by
//!   [`crate::proto::MAX_FRAME`]; the caller-side
//!   [`imagerender::plan_wallpaper`] costs the upload before it is decoded,
//!   and its render validates every band's echoed geometry and exact pixel
//!   length before trusting it. It also draws a picture file as its own
//!   content ([`imagerender::thumbnail`]), its decode bounded by the tile.
//! * [`imageedit`] — a picture an image editor opens is decoded inside the
//!   same worker into the representation its file stores — a palette's
//!   indices, a sprite area's every sprite, a sprite it cannot read as its
//!   bytes — and the caller-side [`imageedit::select_entry`] and
//!   [`imageedit::read_rows`] hold every description, mode word, palette and
//!   index to its bounds before handing on a row.
//! * [`textsyntax`] — a document an editor holds is coloured, detected and
//!   validated inside the worker (`tairix-syntax`), and the caller-side
//!   [`textsyntax::lex_lines`] and [`textsyntax::validate_document`] check
//!   every span and diagnostic against the document before believing it.
//! * [`timesync`] — an NTP server's reply is evaluated inside the worker
//!   (`tairix-net`'s RFC 5905 rules), because the `timed` service that acts
//!   on the verdict holds `CAP_TIME_SET` and must never parse a packet. The
//!   caller-side [`timesync::evaluate_datagram`] gates the nonce echo itself
//!   before the worker is involved and re-validates any returned sample
//!   against the plausibility, round-trip, and stratum bounds.
//! * `rt` (feature `program`, freestanding only; not compiled on hosted
//!   targets) — the production transport: the parent spawns its own binary
//!   in the worker role over a pipe pair wired through
//!   `SpawnAttach::sandbox`.
