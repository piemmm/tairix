//! The duplex, long-lived worker seam: a *session* over a sandboxed
//! worker, beside the one-shot [`crate::host`] / [`crate::worker`] pair.
//!
//! [`crate::host::ParserSandbox`] is right for a parse — a synchronous
//! question with an idempotent answer — and wrong for a protocol
//! connection, where either side originates, one inbound frame may produce
//! zero or many outbound ones, and the owner multiplexes many such
//! conversations on one wait-set. Three differences make a session its own
//! shape rather than a flag on the request path:
//!
//! 1. **Not request/reply-locked.** Many frames are in flight each way.
//! 2. **The parent never blocks.** Every transport operation is one
//!    syscall, taken only when the owner's readiness source said so, so one
//!    slow peer cannot stall the others.
//! 3. **A crashed worker ends the session; it is never replaced.** A parse
//!    is idempotent, so `ParserSandbox` restarts its worker. A session
//!    worker holds the protocol state — keys, sequence numbers — so a
//!    silent replacement would be a correctness hole, not resilience.
//!
//! # Why this cannot deadlock
//!
//! The worker is a pure reactor, and the kernel forces it to be: the
//! sandbox syscall allow-list (`docs/src/security/sandbox.md`) has no
//! wait-set call, no clock, and no RNG, so the pipe is the only thing that
//! can ever wake it. It may therefore use the ordinary **blocking**
//! [`crate::proto::Channel`], and the invariant that makes that safe is
//! that the parent never blocks:
//!
//! * a worker blocked writing is woken because the parent's read readiness
//!   fires and it drains;
//! * a worker blocked reading is woken because the parent's *room*
//!   readiness fires and it writes.
//!
//! Both legs need their wake source, which is why the owner registers
//! [`tairix_abi::WaitSourceKind::Stream`] on the reply descriptor **and**
//! [`tairix_abi::WaitSourceKind::StreamRoom`] on the request descriptor
//! ([`SandboxSession::descriptors`]). Polling for either is forbidden.
//!
//! # Driving it
//!
//! The owner arms each member according to [`SandboxSession::wants_read`]
//! and [`SandboxSession::wants_write`], and on a wake calls the matching
//! `on_readable` / `on_writable`, then drains [`SandboxSession::recv`]
//! until it yields nothing. Disarming a member the session does not want is
//! what keeps a level-triggered readiness source from spinning, and
//! `wants_read` going false is the back-pressure that fills the pipe and
//! blocks the worker.
