//! The production transport: pipes plus the kernel sandbox spawn mode.
//!
//! Compiled only into freestanding `Run` binaries (feature `program`).
//! The parent side ([`RtLauncher`]) spawns **its own binary** in a worker
//! role: two fresh pipes are created, the child's fd 0 is wired to the
//! request pipe's read end and its fd 1 to the reply pipe's write end
//! through `SpawnAttach::sandbox`, and everything else is closed — the
//! kernel then brands the child capability-empty and confines it to the
//! sandbox syscall allow-list (`docs/src/security/sandbox.md`). The worker
//! side ([`serve_stdio`]) serves the protocol over those standard streams,
//! exactly the surface the allow-list admits.
//!
//! A program wires the two halves together in its `Run` binary: early in
//! `main`, [`worker_role`] detects the worker invocation and hands control
//! to [`serve_stdio`]; otherwise the program builds a
//! [`ParserSandbox`](crate::host::ParserSandbox) over an [`RtLauncher`]
//! naming its own program path.
//!
//! The duplex seam ([`crate::session`]) rides the same spawn: a parent
//! constructs an [`RtSessionChannel`] (or has an [`RtSessionLauncher`] do so
//! for a supervised session), keeps its wait-set in step with the two
//! descriptors through [`SessionMembers`], and drives the session from those
//! wakes; the worker detects [`session_worker_role`] and hands control to
//! [`serve_session_stdio`].
