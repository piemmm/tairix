//! The sandboxed image-rendering service: icon rasterisation, desktop
//! wallpaper placement, and document viewing.
//!
//! An application bundle's icon artwork (SVG or PNG bytes shipped inside
//! the bundle by whoever authored it, not by the system), a desktop
//! wallpaper (a photograph the user picked, or a shipped master), and a
//! document a user opened in the viewer are all untrusted input, so
//! decoding and drawing them must not run in the calling process. This
//! module is the parser-sandbox service for all three: the worker side
//! sniffs the format, decodes it, draws it, and replies with validated
//! straight-alpha RGBA8 pixels; the parent side ([`rasterise_icon`],
//! [`plan_wallpaper`], [`render_page`]) trusts nothing about a reply
//! beyond its length and echoed geometry before handing the bytes to the
//! compositor. A crashed or misbehaving worker is contained and replaced
//! by the [`crate::host::ParserSandbox`] seam, and either failure mode — a
//! typed refusal or a sandbox failure — simply means the caller falls back
//! to its own built-in glyph, the desktop backdrop colour, or a stated
//! reason drawn in the viewer's window.
//!
//! # Handing over an untrusted file
//!
//! A file arrives through one path, whatever it is for: its length is
//! declared, then it is carried in pieces no larger than
//! [`MAX_DOCUMENT_CHUNK`] — streamed from a reader by [`upload_document`], or
//! sent by [`send_document`] for a caller that already holds the whole of
//! it. There is deliberately no
//! second way — a request carrying a whole file inline is bounded by what
//! one protocol frame holds, and a source ceiling set anywhere else can
//! quietly exceed that and be refused by the transport rather than served.
//! Streaming also means a caller reading a file need never hold it whole.
//!
//! # Producing icon pixels
//!
//! An **SVG** icon decodes into the desktop's shared vector form
//! (`tairix_svg::decode` then `tairix_icon::VectorIcon::from_svg`) and
//! rasterises directly onto a `side`×`side` surface through the one artwork
//! path every vector asset shares (`VectorIcon::rasterise`);
//! the premultiplied surface is un-premultiplied back to straight alpha for
//! the wire.
//!
//! A **PNG** icon decodes through the complete, fail-closed
//! `tairix_image` decoder, bounded by its own decode limits — tighter than
//! and distinct from the requested output side, so a small `side` cannot
//! be used to smuggle a huge source image past a small reply — and is
//! then fitted inside the `side`×`side` square preserving its aspect
//! ratio and centred, with fully transparent padding on the shorter axis,
//! through the crate's one shared resampler (`tairix_raster::resample`) —
//! never a second, private scaling implementation.
//!
//! # Producing wallpaper pixels
//!
//! A wallpaper render is told two extents: the **screen** it models and the
//! **destination** it actually writes — the same extent for the desktop's
//! own wallpaper, a smaller one for the chooser's true-scale preview.
//! `OP_WALLPAPER_PREPARE` sniffs and decodes the source image at the
//! smallest scale its format offers that still covers the *screen*
//! (`tairix_image::decode_fitted`, so an 8.3-megapixel master bound for a
//! 1080p screen never becomes 8.3 megapixels of held RGBA), then asks the
//! one shared scaling arithmetic (`tairix_wallpaper::nominal_source_size`)
//! what size that decoded image must be treated as having to draw a
//! screen-sized composition onto the destination instead. Exactly when the
//! destination is the screen (the desktop's own case) this nominal size is
//! the decoded size itself, so nothing more happens; otherwise the decoded
//! pixels are resampled once, through the crate's one shared resampler, down
//! to that nominal size before anything is placed — never upscaled, since a
//! destination larger than the screen it claims to model is refused. The
//! placement onto the destination is then computed from the nominal size
//! through the one shared placement geometry (`tairix_wallpaper::place`),
//! so the held pixels and the placement's source rectangle always share one
//! coordinate space, and both are held until `OP_WALLPAPER_RELEASE`.
//! `OP_WALLPAPER_BAND` then produces destination rows of that placement a
//! band at a time — bounded by [`crate::proto::MAX_FRAME`], never raised to
//! fit a larger reply — either by repeating the (possibly resampled) source
//! at 1:1 ([`tairix_wallpaper::WallpaperFit::Tile`]) or by resampling its
//! placed source rectangle through the same shared resampler the icon path
//! uses. Wherever the destination is not fully covered by the placement (a
//! letterboxed fit, a source smaller than the screen), those pixels are
//! fully transparent, so the desktop's own backdrop colour shows through —
//! this service never draws a backdrop.
//!
//! # Viewing a document
//!
//! A viewer holds a file open and moves about inside it, so the view is a
//! *session* rather than a one-shot render. [`open_view`] validates the
//! uploaded document's structure and answers what it declares — its format,
//! how many entries it holds, whether they are frames to play or pages to
//! choose between, and the picture the container as a whole is.
//! [`select_page`] decodes one entry and the worker holds it;
//! [`render_page`] says what extent the whole picture is scaled to and
//! which *rectangle* of that scaling to draw, and collects it band by band;
//! [`close_view`] drops both.
//!
//! That render shape is a zoom's own shape, and three things follow from
//! it. A zoomed-in viewer sends the rectangle it is actually showing, so
//! the work and the reply are bounded by the window rather than by the
//! picture — a hundred-megapixel page costs the same to pan around as a
//! small one, and the scaled picture is never allocated at all. Panning is
//! exact, because the rectangle is addressed in the destination's own
//! pixels: moving by one screen pixel costs one, where naming an integer
//! rectangle of the *page* would quantise a pan to the zoom factor. And the
//! decoded page stays in the worker between requests, so panning and
//! zooming re-draw it rather than decoding it again; the walk owns the
//! document for the same reason, since an animation's frames composite onto
//! their predecessors and a walk rebuilt per request would re-composite
//! every frame before the one asked for.
//!
//! One shape, two backings ([`ViewFormat`]). A raster document is decoded
//! to pixels once per page and a render resamples the rectangle out of
//! them. A vector document has no pixels: the drawing is decoded once at
//! open, and each band rasterises its contours straight into the rectangle
//! it answers, so every zoom level is drawn at full precision rather than
//! resampled from one — and a magnification no buffer could hold costs the
//! window like any other.
//!
//! The viewer's own rotation and flip are deliberately *not* here. They are
//! a permutation of pixels the caller has already been handed and validated,
//! not a decode, so they belong to whatever holds the picture — turning what
//! is displayed costs a window, where turning what was decoded costs the
//! whole page (`tairix_raster::Surface::reoriented`). What this service
//! *does* apply is the orientation a file itself declares, because that is
//! part of reading the file: `tairix_image` rights a turned photograph as it
//! decodes it.
