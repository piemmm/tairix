# tairix-sandbox

The parser-sandbox seam for TAIRiX (`lib/sandbox`).

Every parser of untrusted input runs in a minimum-capability sandbox
process (`docs/src/security/sandbox.md`). The kernel primitive — the
`SPAWN_FLAG_SANDBOX` spawn mode with its empty capability record and closed
syscall allow-list — makes such a process *exist*; this crate is the one
user-space seam that makes it *usable*: typed paths from a calling program
to a sandboxed worker, with crash containment and stable log events. Three
shapes, because a parse, a connection, and a service are different jobs — a
one-shot request/reply path whose worker is replaced after a crash, a duplex
session whose worker is not, because it held the connection's state, and a
supervised duplex session whose worker is, because its owner holds the state
that matters and hands it to each replacement. Every program that sandboxes
untrusted work imports this seam; a second per-app copy is forbidden.

## What it provides

- **The protocol** (`proto`): a length-framed byte protocol over any
  bidirectional channel (`Channel`), bounded by `MAX_FRAME` — a fixed
  validation bound, not a growable capacity. Both sides fail closed on an
  oversize or truncated frame.
- **The worker loop** (`worker`): `serve` reads request frames, hands each
  payload to a `Service`, and writes the reply frame; a closed request
  stream ends the worker cleanly. A `Service` is total: a malformed request
  is a typed error *reply*, never a panic.
- **The host side** (`host`): `ParserSandbox` sends a request and receives
  the reply over a worker its `Launcher` started, waiting no longer than the
  production launcher's reply deadline. Any worker failure — crash,
  protocol violation, oversize reply, no answer in time — is contained: the
  worker is killed if it still runs and disposed of, the caller receives
  `SandboxError::WorkerFailed` naming how it ended (its exit status, read as
  a `WorkerEnd`), and the event is logged with that cause under a stable
  `EventId` (this crate owns the `6000..7000` range). The next request
  starts a replacement. A parser crash never takes down the calling program.
- **The duplex session seam** (`session`): the long-lived counterpart to
  the one-shot pair above, for a worker that serves a *protocol* rather
  than answering a question. `SandboxSession` never blocks: the owner
  drives it from its own wait-set over the two descriptors the transport
  reports — `Stream` on the reply end, `StreamRoom` on the request end —
  so many frames are in flight each way, one inbound frame may be answered
  with none or several, and one session can never stall another. A failed
  worker is disposed of and **not** replaced (`EventId(6002)`), because it
  held the connection's protocol state and a fresh worker could not
  continue it. Both queues are bounded by `SessionBounds` and committed at
  admission, so the steady state allocates nothing and the cost of a
  session is known before it is admitted; the send ceiling is derived from
  the outbound bound, which is what makes `OutboundFull` provably
  transient and `FrameTooLarge` permanent. The queues are
  `lib/collections`' `ByteQueue`, which wipes its storage on drop, because
  a worker's keys cross in these frames. Deadlock-freedom is structural:
  the kernel's allow-list leaves the pipe as the worker's only wake
  source, so `serve_session` may use the ordinary blocking `Channel` while
  the parent's two readiness legs guarantee it is always woken — which is
  why `WaitSourceKind::StreamRoom` exists. `recv` lends each frame in
  place, so taking one never allocates and an event loop is never left
  holding a frame it has no memory to take. `plans/SSH.md` §1.1 is the
  first consumer; the seam is protocol-agnostic.
- **The supervised session** (`supervise`): the duplex seam for a worker
  that serves a *service* rather than one connection, so a failed one is
  replaced. `SupervisedSession` starts each worker through a
  `SessionLauncher` and reports each start as a new generation: the owner
  drops what it derived from the last worker and sends the new one what it
  needs. Replacement is paced by `tairix_util::retry::RestartPacer` — 100 ms,
  doubling to 30 s, forgotten after 30 s of stable service — so a worker
  that crashes on every input cannot turn its owner into a respawn loop. A
  worker that ends its stream has failed, since a supervised worker serves
  until its owner stops it, and a frame the owner cannot believe is
  `condemn`ed exactly as a framing violation. Every failure is reaped and
  logged once as `EventId(6000)`; a refused launch is `EventId(6001)`.
  `discoveryd` is the first consumer.
- **The decode service** (`decode`): the first consumers behind the seam —
  executable-container summaries through `tairix-binfmt` and per-window
  instruction disassembly through `tairix-disasm`, with a bounded,
  fail-closed reply vocabulary. The caller-side helpers decode every reply
  fail-closed: a compromised worker can lie about bytes, never break the
  caller.
- **The help-render service** (`helpdoc`): a foreign bundle's help document
  is parsed and rendered inside the worker (`tairix-help`), and the
  caller-side `render_help` re-parses the reply through the `tairix-vt`
  streaming parser, admitting only the closed render-op set (printable
  text, line feeds, the bold/underline SGR pairs) and re-encoding it
  canonically — a forbidden escape, colour, OSC string, or truncated
  trailing sequence refuses the whole reply. A document-parse error
  round-trips typed (`HelpError`, code for code). `man` is the consumer.
- **The icon-rasterisation service** (`imagerender`): an application
  bundle's icon — SVG or PNG bytes — is sniffed, decoded, and rasterised
  to the caller's requested square side inside the worker
  (`tairix-svg`/`tairix-image`/`tairix-icon`/`tairix-raster`), and the
  caller-side `rasterise_icon` validates the reply's echoed side and exact
  pixel length before trusting the returned straight-alpha RGBA8 buffer. A
  PNG source is fitted inside the square preserving its aspect ratio and
  scaled through the crate's one shared resampler (`tairix-raster`'s
  separable filtered resample in premultiplied-alpha space: the exact area
  integral when reducing, a Catmull-Rom cubic when enlarging); an SVG source
  rasterises directly through the shared vector-icon path. Either a typed
  refusal or a sandbox failure simply means the desktop session falls
  back to its own built-in glyph.
- **The wallpaper-placement service** (also `imagerender`, the same
  worker): a desktop wallpaper — a shipped master or a file the user
  picked, whatever `tairix-image` can decode (every format its `sniff`
  recognises; the list grows with `tairix-image` itself) — is sniffed,
  decoded, and
  placed onto the session's screen size across a three-op sequence:
  `OP_WALLPAPER_PREPARE` decodes the source at the smallest scale its
  format offers that still covers the destination (`tairix-image`'s
  `decode_fitted`, bounded by `MAX_WALLPAPER_DECODE_PIXELS`, so an
  8.3-megapixel master bound for a 1080p screen is decoded at a quarter of
  its pixels rather than in full) and computes its placement
  (`tairix-wallpaper`'s `place`), holding both in the worker;
  `OP_WALLPAPER_BAND` draws and returns a run of destination rows at a
  time, since a screenful of straight-alpha RGBA8 can exceed `MAX_FRAME`
  above 1080p and the frame bound is never raised to fit a larger reply;
  `OP_WALLPAPER_RELEASE` drops the held source. The destination is
  bounded by `MAX_DESTINATION_WIDTH`/`MAX_DESTINATION_HEIGHT` (4K) on both
  sides of the seam — one figure for every destination this worker draws,
  since a wallpaper models a screen and a viewer's picture area sits inside
  a window on one. A tiled fit repeats the decoded source at 1:1; every
  other fit resamples the placement's source rectangle into its destination
  rectangle through the same shared resampler the icon path uses, and any
  pixel the placement does not cover (a letterboxed fit, a source smaller
  than the screen) is left fully transparent so the desktop's own
  backdrop colour shows through — this service never draws a backdrop.
  The caller-side `plan_wallpaper` costs an uploaded source before it is
  decoded, and its render validates every band's echoed geometry and exact
  length fail-closed into the caller's own buffer; the held source is
  released once the render is drawn or dropped, or when the plan is
  refused. A prepare replaces any
  source (and placement) an earlier prepare left held on the same
  (reused) worker.
- **The document-view service** (also `imagerender`, the same worker): a
  picture or document the user opened is held as a *session* rather than
  rendered once, because a viewer keeps a file open and moves about inside
  it. The file arrives through the one chunked upload every untrusted
  document here takes (`OP_DOC_BEGIN`/`OP_DOC_PUSH`, chunked at
  `MAX_DOCUMENT_CHUNK`, derived from `MAX_FRAME` rather than chosen);
  `OP_VIEW_OPEN` reads its structure and answers what it declares — format,
  entry count, whether the entries are frames to play or pages to choose
  between, and the picture the container as a whole is; `OP_VIEW_PAGE`
  decodes one entry and the worker holds it; `OP_VIEW_RENDER` states the
  extent the whole picture is scaled to and which rectangle of that scaling
  to draw; `OP_VIEW_BAND` returns exactly the rows of that rectangle asked
  for; `OP_VIEW_RELEASE` drops the document and everything decoded from it.
  Naming the extent and a rectangle of it — rather than a rectangle of the
  page and a destination size — is what makes a zoom cost the window
  instead of the magnification, keeps panning exact to the screen pixel,
  and gives one request grammar to both backings: a raster document
  (`ViewFormat`'s eight, decoded to pixels once per page under
  `MAX_VIEW_DECODE_PIXELS`) and a vector one (`ViewFormat::Svg`, decoded
  once at open and rasterised afresh into each rectangle, so every zoom
  level is drawn at full precision). A render's extent is held to
  `tairix-raster`'s `MAX_DRAWING_EXTENT` for both, past which a drawing's
  vertices would be clamped and the picture silently distorted. The
  caller-side `open_view`/`select_page`/`render_page`/`close_view`
  validates every reply fail-closed as the wallpaper path does, and
  `render_page` draws into a buffer the caller already holds, so an
  interactive re-render allocates nothing. `upload_document` is the one way a
  caller streams a file into that upload without holding it whole, through a
  chunk buffer it lends and a read that is refused if the file shrinks.
- **The edit-decode service** (`imageedit`, the same worker and the same
  upload): an editor's document, read as its file stores it rather than
  flattened. `open_edit` answers the format and how many entries it holds;
  `select_entry` decodes one — a picture at its own depth, indexed with its
  palette or RGBA, with its sprite's name, mode, mask and palette form, or a
  sprite the decoder cannot read as a kept entry naming why (`KeptReason`) —
  and `read_rows` and `read_kept` fetch its rows or its bytes. The caller side
  holds every answer to the edit bounds (`MAX_EDIT_SIDE`, `MAX_EDIT_PIXELS`,
  `MAX_EDIT_ENTRIES`), checks each index against its palette and each mode
  word against its pixels, and believes nothing it cannot check.
- **The NTP-evaluation service** (`timesync`): a network time server's reply
  is evaluated in the worker (`tairix-net`'s RFC 5905 rules), because the
  `timed` service that acts on the verdict holds `CAP_TIME_SET` and must
  never parse a packet. Unusually for a consumer here, the caller keeps one
  check *ahead* of the worker: the reply's origin timestamp must echo the
  request's CSPRNG nonce — a fixed-offset read of a fixed-length header —
  so a spoofed flood is dropped with no worker round trip at all rather
  than becoming a denial of service against the real reply. Only the fixed
  48-byte header crosses, and the caller-side `evaluate_datagram`
  re-validates any returned sample against the plausibility window, the
  round-trip ceiling, and the usable stratum range before it can reach the
  clock.
- **The production transport** (`rt`, feature `program`, bare-metal only):
  the parent launches **its own binary** in a worker role via
  `SpawnAttach::sandbox` with two pipes wired to the worker's fd 0/1, and
  the worker serves over its standard streams — exactly the surface the
  kernel sandbox allow-list admits. `RtSessionChannel` is the duplex
  transport over that same spawn, through one shared
  pipe-pair-and-attach path, and reports the two descriptor numbers its
  owner registers on a wait-set. `RtSessionLauncher` starts supervised
  workers the same way, and `SessionMembers` keeps a session's two
  descriptors registered on the owner's wait-set exactly while the session
  wants them, across every generation's new pipe pair.

## Security posture

- The sandbox worker is treated as hostile the moment it has parsed a
  byte: reply frames are bounded and every reply field is validated before
  the caller acts on it (fail closed).
- The seam adds no authority: the worker holds only the two pipe ends its
  parent wired at spawn; the kernel enforces the rest
  (`docs/src/security/sandbox.md`).
- Fuzzed: `fuzz_sandbox` (the decode, helpdoc, and imagerender service
  request decoders — icon and wallpaper alike — the caller-side reply
  decoders/validators, and the session seam's inbound codec over a hostile
  worker's byte stream) is enrolled in `cargo xtask fuzz`; `fuzz_discoveryd`
  drives a supervised session against a hostile worker.

## Design

- `no_std` + `alloc`, and `forbid(unsafe_code)` throughout: the `program`
  transport reaches the kernel only through `tairix-rt`'s safe wrappers.
- Host-testable end to end: the `Launcher`/`SessionLauncher`/`Channel` seams
  take in-process fakes exactly as the `Fs`/`Tty` seams do elsewhere.

## Stability

Tier: `experimental`.
