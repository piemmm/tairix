//! Stroking: turning an outline into the area it covers.

//! The input is already a flattened polyline, so the stroked area is the
//! union of simple convex pieces — one quadrilateral per segment, one join
//! per interior vertex, one cap per open end — rather than a pair of offset
//! curves that would have to be trimmed and joined analytically. Every piece
//! is emitted with the same winding direction, so filling the result with the
//! **non-zero** rule unions them; even-odd would punch holes wherever two
//! pieces overlap.
//!
//! Two shapes fall out of that for free: a round join is exactly a disc at
//! the vertex, and a round cap exactly a disc at the end point, because the
//! part of each disc that lies inside the neighbouring quadrilaterals is
//! already covered. Only miter and bevel joins need to know which side of the
//! corner is the outside.
