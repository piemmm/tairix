//! Shared SVG image-decoding library (`lib/svg`).
//!
//! SVG is the canonical, scalable **source** format for every WM/desktop
//! graphical asset — cursors, icons, notification glyphs, window-chrome
//! artwork. This crate is the first-party decoder for that
//! SVG-first pipeline: it is one of the curated image-decoding shared
//! libraries, and — like the rest of the desktop's parsers — it is rolled in
//! house rather than pulled from an external crate, so the
//! trusted computing base does not grow for an asset format.
//!
//! # What it produces
//!
//! [`decode`] turns an SVG byte string into an [`SvgImage`]: a design grid
//! plus the shared `tairix_raster` artwork tree drawn on it (filled layers
//! bottom first, with a group wherever a clip, a mask, or a group opacity
//! composites a subtree as a unit), and the optional pointer hotspot and
//! outline a cursor asset declares. A
//! [`Viewport`] chooses the shape the drawing is fitted to — the square slot
//! an icon or cursor occupies, or the document's own proportions a viewer
//! shows a picture at — and nothing else about it. That is exactly the vector
//! form `lib/cursor`'s `VectorCursor` and `lib/icon`'s `VectorIcon` already
//! rasterise through `lib/raster`'s single scan converter, so the SVG-first
//! pipeline converts an asset **once** into this fast-draw form and never
//! re-parses SVG on the hot compositing path.
//!
//! # Untrusted input
//!
//! On-disk assets under `/System/Graphics` are untrusted.
//! [`decode`] is therefore total: it never panics for any byte string, returns
//! a precise [`SvgError`] for anything outside the supported subset, and a
//! caller fails closed to its built-in fallback artwork rather than crashing
//! the compositor.
//!
//! # What it understands
//!
//! So far — `plans/SVG.md` carries the staged remainder: the document tree
//! (`<g>`, `<defs>`,
//! `<symbol>`, `<use>`, `<switch>`, nested `<svg>` viewports), every basic
//! shape (`<path>`, `<rect>` with rounded corners, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`,
//! `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`), the whole path grammar including
//! cubic and quadratic curves and elliptical arcs, the whole `transform`
//! grammar, `viewBox` with `preserveAspectRatio`, strokes (width, caps,
//! joins, miter limit, dashes), the property cascade with the document's own
//! `<style>` sheets, the `style` attribute and inheritance, CSS colour syntax
//! with named colours, linear and radial gradients, `<pattern>` fills,
//! `clip-path`, `mask`, group opacity, `<marker>` at the vertices a
//! `<path>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, or `<polygon>` states, and
//! `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"`.
//!
//! Not yet drawn, and staged rather than declined: text, embedded images,
//! filters, SMIL animation, the CSS surface the cascade drops, external
//! references, the three remaining `vector-effect` values, and scripting;
//! `<foreignObject>` is deliberately undrawable so a `<switch>` takes its
//! fallback. `plans/SVG.md` carries each as a numbered item. An element it
//! cannot yet draw is skipped
//! rather than refused, so one unsupported decoration does not lose the
//! whole asset; the open question of whether such an element should instead
//! fail the document closed is recorded in `plans/ICONS.md`.
//!
//! ```
//! let svg = br##"<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
//!   <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" fill="#3070f0" stroke="black" stroke-width="1"/>
//! </svg>"##;
//! let image = tairix_svg::decode(
//!     svg,
//!     tairix_svg::Viewport::Square,
//!     &mut tairix_svg::font::NoFonts,
//! )
//! .expect("a stroked circle");
//! // The fill, then the stroke over it: SVG's painting order.
//! assert_eq!(image.nodes().len(), 2);
//! ```
