//! The decoded SVG document and the top-level [`decode`] entry point.
//!
//! [`SvgImage`] is the shared, fast-draw vector form a decoded asset becomes:
//! a square design grid plus the `tairix_raster` artwork tree `lib/cursor`'s
//! `VectorCursor`, `lib/icon`'s `VectorIcon`, and the document viewer all
//! draw. SVG is *converted once* into that form and never re-parsed on the
//! hot compositing path.
//!
//! # How a document becomes artwork
//!
//! The tree is walked once, depth first, in document order — which is SVG's
//! painting order. Each element inherits its parent's resolved [`Style`] and
//! accumulated transform; a shape becomes up to two layers, its fill and then
//! its stroke, because that is the order SVG paints them in. Curves, arcs,
//! and stroke outlines have all become polygons by then, so what leaves this
//! module is pure filled geometry.
//!
//! An element whose opacity, `clip-path`, or `mask` makes its subtree a
//! composited unit becomes a [`Group`] around that geometry. An element that
//! needs none of the three adds no group at all, so a flat asset decodes to a
//! flat list. Which of the three is the outer group does not matter: each is
//! a per-pixel scalar on the composited subtree, and those commute — only the
//! isolation itself changes the picture.
//!
//! # The design grid
//!
//! Every asset is placed on the same [`DESIGN_GRID`] whatever its own
//! `viewBox` says, so a consumer never rescales between assets and curve
//! flattening has a single, known accuracy target. [`Viewport`] chooses how
//! a drawing is fitted to it: letter-boxed under `preserveAspectRatio` into
//! the square slot the desktop draws icons and cursors in, or normalised
//! across both axes for a consumer that will rasterise into the drawing's
//! own shape.
