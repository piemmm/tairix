//! The geometry every stage of the decode hands on: flattened contours in

//! SVG's shapes are curves, arcs, and stroked outlines; the desktop's
//! rasteriser fills polygons. Everything therefore becomes a [`SubPath`] — an
//! ordered run of user-space points, open or closed — as early as possible,
//! and every later stage (stroking, transforming, mapping onto the design
//! grid) works on that one representation rather than on a shape-specific
//! form. There is exactly one flattening step and one place a curve stops
//! being a curve.
