//! The freestanding driver-process serve loop of the `netchan-v1` device
//! channel (`plans/NETWORK.md` N4d).
//!
//! This is the I/O half of the contract's driver side: everything a NIC
//! driver process must do *around* an opened [`Net`] device to serve the
//! network stack, written once for every such driver rather than copied per
//! device. It claims a
//! reserved device-channel endpoint bound restricted-sender, publishes the
//! [`NETCHAN_NODE_COMPATIBLE`] node so `devmgr` hands the endpoint to the
//! stack, and then parks — never busy-polls — on a wait set over two
//! sources:
//!
//! * a **call** wake decodes one request and drives the pure
//!   [`NetChannelServer`]; `Attach` maps the granted frame region, `Service`
//!   drives one device doorbell over it, `Detach` unmaps it;
//! * an **interrupt** wake masks the device's completion sources, harvests
//!   the rings into the shared region itself, and wakes the stack with a
//!   single notify.
//!
//! # Why the interrupt path harvests, and why it masks first
//!
//! Both halves of this exist because the naive shape — acknowledge, notify,
//! re-park — is pathological on real hardware.
//!
//! *Masking.* A DMA engine's completion status is a latch over a **level**
//! condition ("completed descriptors are waiting"). Acknowledging clears the
//! latch, but with frames still undrained the condition re-latches at once,
//! and the kernel re-arms the line every time this process parks. The driver
//! then spins interrupt → acknowledge → notify → park at the speed of a
//! context switch until the stack catches up — measurable as a permanently
//! busy core on an otherwise idle machine. So the completion sources are
//! masked on entry and unmasked only once the device has nothing left and
//! the shared ring has room; a burst costs one interrupt instead of one per
//! frame, which is the coalescing a fixed frame threshold cannot give.
//!
//! *Harvesting.* The frame region is already mapped here, so making the
//! stack ask for the frames with a blocking call costs two extra process
//! switches per batch for nothing. The interrupt fills the ring and rings
//! the doorbell once; the stack reads the ring in its own time and calls
//! back only when it has transmit work or the driver reported
//! back-pressure. The ring's atomic counters are what make that safe.
//!
//! Compiled only for the bare-metal targets a driver binary is built for.
