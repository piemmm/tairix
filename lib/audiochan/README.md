# tairix-audiochan

TAIRiX audio device-channel driver side: the `audiochan-v1` server every audio
driver *process* runs (`plans/SOUND.md` SND4). Stability tier:
**experimental** — it tracks the unfrozen `abi-v1` `audiochan-v1` contract.

The mixer service (`audiod`) runs in its own address space and owns the shared
PCM regions; an audio driver owns its device (MMIO, DMA, interrupt) and serves
a call endpoint. This crate is everything a driver process must do *around* an
opened `Audio` device, written once rather than copied per device, so a driver
is device bring-up plus one `serve` call.

It is separate from `lib/audio` for the reason `lib/netchan` is separate from
`lib/net`: a driver process must not link the mixer.

## The two halves

* `server` — `AudioChannelServer`, the pure, host-testable request handler:
  the per-endpoint unconfigured/configured/attached state machine, the
  geometry validation, and the period service. It performs no I/O, so the
  whole control plane is exercised on the host against a mock `Audio`.
* `serve` — the freestanding process loop (bare-metal targets only): it
  claims a reserved device-channel endpoint bound restricted-sender on
  `CAP_AUDIO_DEVICE`, emits the `audiochan` hardware-tree node the device
  manager hands to the mixer, and parks on a wait set over `{call endpoint,
  device interrupt}`.

## The cyclic engine

`cyclic::CyclicPlayback` is the stream of every device a DMA controller feeds
from a looping buffer, written once over two seams: `DmaPort`, the channel
(`cyclic::LinkDma` in a driver process, over `tairix-linkclient`), and
`FrameCodec`, how the device's frame sits in the buffer. The buffer holds four
periods and the one after the period playing is always written, as silence
counted lost when the mixer supplied none, because a period left alone would
replay a lap-old sound. A buffer frame is as many bytes as a ring frame of two
channels in the codec's format, whole FIFO words, so a period is read from the
ring straight into place. A stream ends parked: the codec's parked frame fills
the buffer and the channel stops at its next boundary, once that frame has
reached the device. The modelled channel drivers test against is
`cyclic::mock`, behind the `mock-dma` feature.

## State is per endpoint, not per channel

A device presents several sinks and sources and each is driven independently,
so one channel carries several endpoints' state. `Configure` programs the
hardware and records the grant; `Attach` validates the offered ring against
*that grant* through `ConfigureGrant::geometry` — the single derivation both
sides size the region from, so they cannot disagree about how large it is. A
reconfiguration drops the attached region rather than leaving it the wrong
shape, and the serve loop unmaps it in the same step.

A grant whose period rounds up past its own ring ceiling admits no
power-of-two ring at all, so it is refused as a device fault at `Configure`
rather than at every later `Attach`.

## The interrupt path services, and that is deliberate

A period interrupt *means* "the device has consumed a period; refill it". The
region is already mapped in the driver, so making the mixer ask for the refill
with a blocking call would cost two extra process switches per period on the
one path in the system whose whole job is not to have jitter — and would put
the refill deadline behind the mixer's scheduling latency rather than the
driver's. The driver moves the period itself and then sends one notify
carrying the `(position, sampled_at)` pair the mixer's linear clock fit is
built from. The ring's atomic counters are what make that safe.

The device's event sources are masked whenever nothing is attached, so a
device left clocking cannot storm a driver with nowhere to put frames, and
they are released again on the mixer's next `Service`. An under- or over-run
is reported as the *delta* since the previous service, because the wire report
already carries the running total.

Nothing polls: between events the process parks on its wait set, and the
device's own period interrupt is the only timer in the stack.

## Fail closed

Every reply is a fully-encoded `audiochan-v1` frame carrying a typed `Errno`:
an endpoint index the device does not present, a transport call before attach,
a region that does not match the agreed geometry or is not aligned for the
ring counters, or any device fault. Never a panic, never a partially-applied
action — a refused attach leaves no state and no mapping, and a release the
hardware refused still forgets the channel, because the process is about to
unmap the region either way. Set-up refusals in `serve` return a reserved
`exit` code (the same numbers `lib/netchan` uses, so one supervisor table
reads both classes), so a driver that cannot serve ends with a diagnosable
reason rather than degrading into a busy re-poll.

An autoloaded driver is detached, so nothing reads its `stderr` and the exit
code alone would name only the stage that gave up. Every such refusal is
therefore recorded through `fail`, which writes the reason — and the typed
refusal behind it, where there was one — to the system log before returning
the code. It lives here, beside the codes, so two audio drivers cannot
describe the same failure differently.
