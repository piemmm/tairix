//! The freestanding driver-process serve loop of the `audiochan-v1` device
//! channel (`plans/SOUND.md` SND4).
//!
//! This is the I/O half of the contract's driver side: everything an audio
//! driver process must do *around* an opened [`Audio`] device to serve the
//! mixer, written once for every such driver rather than copied per device.
//! It claims a reserved device-channel endpoint bound restricted-sender on
//! `CAP_AUDIO_DEVICE`, publishes the [`AUDIOCHAN_NODE_COMPATIBLE`] node so
//! `devmgr` hands the endpoint to `audiod`, and then parks — never
//! busy-polls — on a wait set over two sources:
//!
//! * a **call** wake decodes one request and drives the pure
//!   [`AudioChannelServer`]; `Attach` maps the granted PCM region, `Service`
//!   drives one device doorbell over it, `Detach` unmaps it;
//! * an **interrupt** wake reads the device's causes, moves a period for
//!   every endpoint whose boundary passed, and wakes the mixer with one
//!   notify carrying the clock pair.
//!
//! # Why the interrupt path services rather than merely notifying
//!
//! The period interrupt *means* "the device has consumed a period; refill
//! it". The region is already mapped here, so making the mixer ask for the
//! refill with a blocking call would cost two extra process switches per
//! period on the one path in the system whose whole job is not to have any
//! jitter — and would put the refill deadline behind the mixer's scheduling
//! latency instead of the driver's. So the driver moves the period itself
//! and then reports the clock pair; the mixer keeps its linear fit current
//! and writes ahead in its own time. The ring's atomic counters are what
//! make that safe.
//!
//! Compiled only for the bare-metal targets a driver binary is built for.
