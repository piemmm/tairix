//! The driver-side per-request handler of the `audiochan-v1` device-channel
//! contract (`plans/SOUND.md` SND4).
//!
//! [`AudioChannelServer`] is the pure, host-testable engine an audio driver
//! *process* drives: the process owns the device (MMIO/DMA/IRQ) and the call
//! endpoint, and hands each decoded
//! [`AudioChannelRequest`](tairix_abi::driver::audio_channel::AudioChannelRequest)
//! to this server, which turns it into the right device action and the
//! matching reply. The I/O — receiving the request, mapping the granted PCM
//! regions, sending the reply and the period notifies — stays in the crate's
//! `serve` loop.
//!
//! # State machine, per endpoint
//!
//! A device presents several sinks and sources and each is driven
//! independently, so the state is per endpoint rather than per channel.
//!
//! An endpoint starts **unconfigured**: `Facts` and `EndpointFacts` answer,
//! and everything else refuses with [`Errno::NotConnected`]. `Configure`
//! programs the hardware and records the grant the ring will be shaped from;
//! `Attach` validates the offered geometry against *that recorded grant* and
//! moves the endpoint to **attached**, from which `Start`, `Stop`, `Drain`
//! and `Service` work. `Detach` releases the endpoint's device-side resources
//! and returns it to unconfigured.
//!
//! Validating the attach against the recorded grant is what stops the two
//! sides disagreeing about the region's size: the grant is the *device's* own
//! answer, and [`ConfigureGrant::geometry`] is the single derivation both
//! sides size the region from.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! Every reply is a fully-encoded `audiochan-v1` frame. An endpoint index the
//! device does not present, a service before attach, a region whose length
//! does not match the agreed geometry, or any device fault is a typed
//! [`Errno`] carried in the reply's status word — never a panic, never a
//! partially-applied action.
