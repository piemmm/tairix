//! A container of independent pages, walked one at a time.
//!
//! An icon file's entries and a RISC OS sprite area's sprites are both
//! pictures in their own right rather than frames of one animation, so both
//! are walked and addressed the same way. Only locating and decoding a page
//! differs between them, which is what [`PageSource`] is; the cursor, the
//! remembered refusal, and the one retained decode are shared.
//!
//! The document is handed to each call rather than held, so a walk borrows
//! nothing and a caller can own both it and the bytes it reads.
