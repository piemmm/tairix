//! First-party TAIRiX raster-image decoding (`lib/image`).
//!
//! The desktop's application-icon pipeline decodes a bundle's own icon
//! artwork — SVG or PNG — inside a minimum-capability parser sandbox before
//! it ever touches the compositor (a bundle is untrusted input: its icon
//! ships from whoever authored the `.app`, not from the system), and the
//! desktop pinboard decodes a wallpaper — a shipped master or a file the
//! user picked — the same way. This crate is the raster half of both
//! pipelines: complete, `no_std` + `alloc`, `unsafe`-free decoders that turn
//! an untrusted byte stream into a validated, straight-alpha RGBA8 pixel
//! buffer, or a typed refusal — never a panic, and never more memory than the
//! caller allows.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`decode`] and [`decode_fitted`] dispatch on the format [`sniff`]
//! recognises from a byte signature: PNG ([`ImageFormat::Png`]), JPEG
//! ([`ImageFormat::Jpeg`]), GIF ([`ImageFormat::Gif`]), BMP
//! ([`ImageFormat::Bmp`]), TIFF ([`ImageFormat::Tiff`]), and the icon and
//! cursor containers ([`ImageFormat::Ico`]), each decoded by its own private
//! module — BMP and ICO by one, because an icon's entries are the bitmaps
//! BMP already reads.
//! [`ImageFormat`] stays closed and grows only with a real consumer, exactly
//! as PNG was added for the icon pipeline, JPEG for the wallpaper masters,
//! and the rest for the picture viewer. Being the one raster
//! registry is what keeps a format's decoder in a single place: a consumer
//! that decides to admit a further one needs no decoder of its own — though
//! admitting it is that consumer's decision, and the icon pipeline
//! deliberately admits only PNG and SVG.
//!
//! # Naming a format instead of sniffing it
//!
//! Only a format that carries a signature can be recognised from content, and
//! a RISC OS sprite area ([`ImageFormat::Sprite`]) does not: its first word is
//! the sprite count, and RISC OS types a file from its directory entry. So
//! [`sniff`] never answers it and never guesses one from a structural
//! coincidence — a heuristic there would be a false-positive machine, and one
//! this crate would then act on. A caller that already knows the type instead
//! names the format: [`probe_as`], [`decode_as`], and [`Sequence::open_as`]
//! take an [`ImageFormat`] in place of the sniff, and the sniffing entry
//! points are exactly [`sniff`] plus those. The named format's own parser
//! still validates the bytes, so naming the wrong one is refused rather than
//! misread.
//!
//! # Sequences and pages
//!
//! Some containers hold more than one picture. [`Sequence`] is the one shape
//! for all of them: [`Sequence::open`] validates the structure and reports
//! [`SequenceInfo`], and [`Sequence::next_frame`] decodes the entries in
//! order. Stepping is forward-only with [`Sequence::rewind`], because that is
//! what an animation *is* — a frame composites onto its predecessors under
//! the container's own disposal model, so being able to ask for frame *n*
//! directly would mean re-compositing every frame before it. A page
//! container's entries are independent pictures instead, and choosing
//! between them is the point, so [`Sequence::page`] addresses one directly:
//! an icon file's sizes, a sprite area's icons, a TIFF document's pages.
//! A still picture is the one-entry case of the same shape, so a consumer
//! that shows pictures, animations, and icon files needs one path rather
//! than three.
//!
//! [`RasterImage`] is the one output shape every format decodes into: a
//! row-major, 4-byte-per-pixel, **straight-alpha** RGBA8 buffer (not
//! premultiplied — `lib/raster`'s `Surface::from_rgba8` is where
//! premultiplication happens, once, on the consumer side). Keeping the
//! decoder's output straight-alpha means a decoder never needs to know
//! anything about the compositor's internal pixel representation.
//!
//! # Reduced-scale decoding
//!
//! [`decode`] always produces an image at its natural (full) size, and is
//! refused outright when that size breaches the caller's limits.
//! [`decode_fitted`] instead produces the smallest size a format's own
//! decode process can still cover a caller's [`FitBox`] with, which for
//! JPEG means choosing the coarsest DCT decode scale (one whole, one half,
//! one quarter, or one eighth) whose result covers the box on both axes,
//! computed via reduced inverse DCTs rather than a full decode followed by
//! a resample. Where even that scale's output would breach the limits,
//! [`decode_fitted`] degrades to the largest scale that fits rather than
//! refusing — a deliberate trade of sharpness for memory, decided from the
//! header's geometry before anything is allocated, and refused only when
//! not even the coarsest scale fits. An icon container has its own kind of
//! scale — it *is* one picture at several sizes — so a fitted decode there
//! takes the smallest entry covering the box rather than computing anything.
//! PNG, GIF, and BMP have no reduced-scale decode process at all — their
//! entropy coding and row layout do not separate into scale-selectable
//! passes the way a block transform does, and neither does a sprite area or
//! a TIFF's grid of strips and tiles — so for those [`decode_fitted`] is
//! exactly [`decode`] and has no degradation to offer; that is an honest
//! property of the formats, not a gap this crate is missing. WEBP is the
//! same, for a sharper reason: both its codecs read full-resolution
//! neighbours, so a coarser transform would decode a *different* picture
//! rather than a softer one.
//!
//! # Bounds and fail-closed policy
//!
//! [`DecodeLimits`] is the caller's ceiling on the image this crate will
//! ever produce: a maximum width, height, total pixel count, and — because
//! a progressive JPEG scan must buffer every coefficient of every
//! component before its final scan can produce a single pixel — a maximum
//! size for that coefficient store. A format decoder weighs the size it is
//! about to produce — the declared dimensions for [`decode`], the chosen
//! scale's output for [`decode_fitted`] — against the limits **the moment
//! it reads the header** and before allocating a single scanline, palette
//! entry, coefficient block, or output pixel, so a hostile "16384×16384
//! declared, 12 bytes of actual data" file cannot make this crate reserve
//! memory proportional to the lie rather than the bytes actually present.
//! Every other declared size (a chunk length, a decompressed-image byte
//! count, a palette entry count, a Huffman or quantisation table length) is
//! validated against the bytes remaining in the input, or against a size
//! computed purely from the already-bounded geometry, before it is used to
//! index or allocate anything.
//!
//! Every public entry point is total: malformed, truncated, or adversarial
//! input returns a [`DecodeError`] variant, never a panic. All size and
//! offset arithmetic over untrusted values uses checked or widened integer
//! operations, so a crafted input cannot provoke an overflow panic even in
//! a debug build.
//!
//! # Pictures as their files store them
//!
//! An editor needs more than what a picture looks like: a palette picture's
//! indices and palette, a TIFF's every page, a sprite area's every sprite
//! with its name, mode, palette and mask. [`open_native`] answers that
//! [`Picture`] form — a TIFF through [`TiffPages`] and a sprite area through
//! [`SpriteAreaReader`], which keeps a sprite it cannot read as its exact
//! bytes — with the pixel [`Density`] the file states, what it held that the
//! picture does not ([`Unkept`]), and how it was [`Written`].
//!
//! # Writing
//!
//! [`encode_png`], [`encode_jpeg`], [`encode_gif`], [`encode_bmp`],
//! [`encode_tiff`] and [`encode_sprite_area`] write the formats an editor
//! saves, each reading its picture a row at a time through [`PictureSource`],
//! stating its density where the format can, and refusing, with an
//! [`EncodeError`], a picture its format cannot state rather than writing
//! something else.
