//! A complete, fail-closed VP8 keyframe decoder (RFC 6386).
//!
//! The WEBP container carries exactly one kind of VP8 frame — a keyframe —
//! so everything here is intra coding: there are no reference frames, no
//! motion vectors, and no inter modes, and a bitstream that declares itself
//! an interframe is refused rather than half-read. Within that, the format
//! is complete: the boolean entropy decoder, the segmentation, loop-filter
//! and quantiser headers with their per-segment and per-mode deltas, the
//! token probability updates, the four whole-macroblock luma modes and four
//! chroma modes, all ten subblock modes, the Walsh-Hadamard and DCT
//! reconstructions, both the normal and the simple loop filter at
//! macroblock and subblock edges, and the conversion to RGB.
//!
//! # Two readings of the frame header
//!
//! **A reserved colour space is refused.** The header's one colour-space bit
//! selects ITU-R BT.601 at zero and is reserved at one, and a decoder that
//! guessed BT.601 for the reserved value would silently produce the wrong
//! colours rather than say it could not.
//!
//! **The clamping-type bit is read and not acted on.** It says whether
//! reconstruction *needs* clamping; clamping regardless is correct either
//! way, and the alternative is trusting a file's word that its arithmetic
//! stays in range.
//!
//! The horizontal and vertical scale fields are likewise read and not acted
//! on: they ask a *display* to stretch the picture, and the decoded picture
//! is the size the header declares.
//!
//! # Where the arithmetic must match exactly
//!
//! Both transforms, the six intra-prediction averaging rules, and both loop
//! filters are specified as integer code with exact rounding, and a decoder
//! that rounds differently drifts visibly rather than approximately. Each is
//! transcribed from the reference decoder's own arithmetic.
//!
//! One erratum is worth naming: the reference code for the horizontal-down
//! subblock mode reads `svg2p` where the mode's own diagonal pattern, and
//! every other implementation, require `avg2p`.
