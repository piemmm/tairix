//! A complete, fail-closed JPEG decoder (ITU-T T.81), framed as JFIF or
//! Adobe.
//!
//! Supported: baseline sequential (SOF0), extended sequential (SOF1), and
//! progressive (SOF2) DCT frames, all Huffman-coded, at 8-bit sample
//! precision; 1-component greyscale and 3-component YCbCr, plus RGB when
//! an Adobe APP14 marker declares a colour transform of zero; any
//! per-component sampling factor from 1 to 4; up to four DC and four AC
//! Huffman tables; 8-bit and 16-bit quantisation tables; restart markers;
//! and multi-scan streams. Everything else — arithmetic coding, lossless
//! and hierarchical frames, 12-bit precision, 2- or 4-component images,
//! and a deferred height via `DNL` — is a typed, fail-closed refusal
//! rather than a best-effort guess.
//!
//! # Orientation is applied, not reported
//!
//! A camera states which way up it was holding the sensor in an EXIF
//! `Orientation` attribute, in the `APP1` segment before the frame header,
//! and it is the same tag TIFF carries — so a decoder that ignored it would
//! hand every consumer a photograph on its side. The picture this decoder
//! produces is therefore already the right way up: the attribute swaps the
//! geometry [`probe`] reports, the axes a [`decode_fitted`] box is measured
//! against, and the limits the picture is checked against.
//!
//! Metadata is advisory, so a block that is absent, malformed, or states a
//! value outside the eight the tag defines leaves the picture as stored
//! rather than refusing the file. That is deliberately unlike TIFF, where
//! the same tag sits in the directory describing the pixels being decoded
//! and a bad value means the file cannot be read at all: here a camera's
//! malformed metadata must not cost a reader the photograph.
//!
//! # Decoding shape
//!
//! The stream is a sequence of markers (ITU-T T.81 Annex B): tables
//! (`DQT`, `DHT`, `DRI`), exactly one frame header (`SOF0`/`SOF1`/`SOF2`),
//! and one or more scans (`SOS` followed by its entropy-coded data). A
//! non-progressive frame's scans always cover the whole coefficient
//! spectrum for the components they list, so this decoder streams each
//! scan straight into per-component sample planes and never holds more
//! than one block's coefficients at a time. A progressive frame's scans
//! instead each carry a partial spectral band or a successive-approximation
//! refinement (Annex G), so nothing can be reconstructed until every scan
//! has been read: this decoder buffers every component's every block's
//! coefficients — bounded by
//! [`crate::DecodeLimits::max_progressive_coefficient_bytes`] — and only
//! dequantises and inverse-transforms them once, after the last scan.
//!
//! Every declared size — a segment length, a table length, a scan's
//! component count — is validated against the bytes actually available,
//! or against a value computed purely from already-bounded geometry,
//! before it is used to allocate or index anything; see the crate
//! documentation for the full bounds policy.
