//! Canonical prefix-code assignment, shared by every format here whose
//! entropy coding is one.
//!
//! A JPEG Huffman table and a WEBP lossless stream's prefix codes are the
//! same construction: codes of one length are consecutive, assigned in
//! symbol order, and each length's first code is the previous length's last
//! plus one, doubled. Only what surrounds it differs — the bit source, the
//! alphabet's width, whether an incomplete code is legal, and the refusal
//! each format names — so the assignment and the walk that decodes one live
//! here, and the rest stays with the format.
//!
//! A table is its code-length counts and nothing else, because a lossless
//! WEBP holds one prefix code per channel per meta-Huffman group and a file
//! may declare tens of thousands of groups: at that count a table of
//! precomputed per-length values would cost hundreds of times the bytes the
//! stream declaring them occupies. [`Walk`] recovers each length's first
//! code and first symbol as it consumes bits, which is the same arithmetic
//! the assignment performed and costs a few operations per bit.

/// The longest prefix code any format here defines, which is JPEG's limit.
/// A WEBP lossless code never exceeds fifteen bits; holding sixteen does not
/// permit one, since the caller supplies its own length bound.
