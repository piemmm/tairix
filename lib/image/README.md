# tairix-image

Stability tier: **experimental**.

First-party TAIRiX raster images: complete, fail-closed PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP,
ICO/CUR, RISC OS sprite, TIFF and WEBP decoders that turn untrusted artwork
into a validated, straight-alpha RGBA8 pixel buffer, or a typed refusal —
never a panic, and never more memory than the caller allows — and the PNG,
JPEG and sprite-area encoders an editor saves with.

## Consumers

The desktop's sandboxed image-rendering service (`lib/sandbox`'s
`imagerender`) decodes both an application bundle's own icon — SVG or
PNG — and the desktop wallpaper (a shipped master, or a photograph the
user picked) inside a minimum-capability parser sandbox before either
reaches the compositor, because neither ships from the system. This crate
is the raster half of that pipeline; the vector half is `lib/svg`. The
shipped wallpaper masters in `lib/wallpaper/assets` are baseline JPEG
authored no larger than the wallpaper renderer's own maximum destination
(3840×2160), but a user-picked photograph can still arrive at many times
that, which is what `decode_fitted` and the progressive-store bound below
exist for.

The picture viewer (`plans/VIEW.md`) and the image editor (`plans/PAINT.md`)
are the other consumers, through the same sandbox. Every format they claim
lands here rather than beside them, so a format's decoder exists once.
*Admitting* a format is still each consumer's own decision: the icon pipeline
deliberately takes only PNG and SVG (`plans/ICONS.md`), and the wallpaper
catalog only its own extensions.

## Formats

`ImageFormat` is a deliberately closed enum. `decode`, `decode_fitted`, and
`Sequence::open` dispatch on the signature `sniff` recognises; a caller that
already knows the type instead *names* the format, which is the only way to
reach one that carries no signature (see below). A further format is added
only when a real consumer needs it — never speculatively.

- **PNG** (`ImageFormat::Png`, W3C PNG): every colour type and bit depth,
  interlaced or not.
- **JPEG** (`ImageFormat::Jpeg`, ITU-T T.81): baseline sequential (`SOF0`),
  extended sequential (`SOF1`), and progressive (`SOF2`) DCT frames with
  Huffman coding at 8-bit precision; 1-component greyscale and 3-component
  YCbCr, plus RGB when an Adobe APP14 marker (Adobe TN5116) declares
  colour transform zero; any per-component sampling factor from 1 to 4;
  restart markers; multi-scan streams; up to four DC and four AC Huffman
  tables; and 8- or 16-bit quantisation tables.
- **GIF** (`ImageFormat::Gif`, GIF89a and its GIF87a subset): both versions;
  global and local colour tables at every declared size; the whole block
  chain; the variable-code-width LZW dialect with the not-yet-defined-code
  case and the deferred clear; four-pass interlacing; the transparent colour
  index; the full frame-disposal model; and the de-facto `NETSCAPE2.0`
  animation-loop count.
- **BMP** (`ImageFormat::Bmp`, the Windows device-independent bitmap): the
  `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and every DIB header of the Windows lineage —
  `BITMAPCOREHEADER`, `BITMAPINFOHEADER`, and the `V2`/`V3`/`V4`/`V5`
  headers extending it; 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits per pixel;
  `BI_RGB`, `BI_RLE4`, `BI_RLE8`, `BI_BITFIELDS`, and `BI_ALPHABITFIELDS`;
  bottom-up and top-down row order; and colour tables of both entry widths.
- **ICO and CUR** (`ImageFormat::Ico`, the Windows icon and cursor
  containers): the directory of independent pictures at different sizes,
  each entry a DIB with its 1-bit AND mask or a whole PNG file, with
  addressed access to any page.
- **RISC OS sprite areas** (`ImageFormat::Sprite`, Acorn filetype `&FF9`):
  the area control block as a file holds it, the chain of 44-byte sprite
  control blocks, left- and right-hand wastage, old-style screen mode
  numbers, RISC OS 3.5 sprite mode words, the RISC OS 5 extended mode word
  with its mode-flags channel order and alpha, 1/2/4/8/16/24/32 bits per
  pixel across the 1:5:5:5, 5:6:5, 4:4:4:4, 8:8:8, and 8:8:8:8 packings,
  sprite palettes including the full 256-entry form and the short VIDC1
  ones, and all three mask forms — an old-format mask at the image's own
  depth, a new-format 1-bit mask, and a wide 8-bit alpha mask.
- **TIFF** (`ImageFormat::Tiff`, TIFF 6.0): both byte orders; the chain of
  image file directories, each an independent page; strips *and* tiles;
  chunky and planar plane arrangements; bit depths 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32
  across the unsigned, signed, and IEEE-float sample formats; the
  `WhiteIsZero`, `BlackIsZero`, `RGB`, palette, transparency-mask, separated
  (CMYK) and `YCbCr` photometrics, the last with its chrominance subsampling,
  luma weights and coded ranges; the horizontal and floating-point
  predictors; associated and unassociated extra-sample alpha; the
  `Orientation` tag; and the compressions none, `PackBits`, LZW in both its
  dialects, Deflate/`AdobeDeflate`, CCITT modified-Huffman, Group 3 (one- and
  two-dimensional) and Group 4, and JPEG-in-TIFF.

A format this crate claims is decoded **completely** — every bit depth,
compression, colour handling, and structural variant the format defines, not
the subset a common file happens to use. A format that could only be
half-decoded is not claimed at all.

BMP reads the specification literally but for two places, both stated in its
module's own rustdoc. A 32-bit `BI_RGB` pixel's fourth byte is undefined, so
a BMP file's is ignored and the picture comes out opaque, while an icon's is
the alpha channel every writer since Windows XP fills — the file header is
what tells the two apart. And pixels a run-length-encoded array never covers
stay fully transparent, because the format gives them no value and every
other choice invents one. An icon whose alpha channel is zero in every pixel
carries none at all, so its 1-bit mask is what says which pixels are absent.

The OS/2 2.x header lengths are refused by name rather than half-read: they
share the Windows prefix but read compression codes 3 and 4 as Huffman 1D and
RLE24, two codecs with no other consumer here.

A sprite area has **no signature at all** — its first word is the sprite
count, and RISC OS types a file from its directory entry — so `sniff` never
answers `ImageFormat::Sprite` and never guesses one from a structural
coincidence. A caller that knows the type from a filetype, a media type, or
the name a file was picked by reaches the decoder by naming the format
(`probe_as` / `decode_as` / `Sequence::open_as`); the named format's own
parser still validates the bytes, so naming the wrong one is refused rather
than misread. The sprite decoder also takes three readings the format's own
text does not settle, all stated in its module rustdoc: a sprite with no
palette shows the desktop's colours (`desktop_palette`), never a PC palette —
two colours are Wimp colours 0 and 7, four are 0, 2, 4 and 7, sixteen are the
sixteen Wimp colours, and 256 are the screen-memory byte's own tint
arrangement; a palette shorter than the depth needs is the VIDC1 arrangement,
its last sixteen entries being the hardware registers and a pixel's top four
bits overriding supremacy bits; and where a file carries both a mask and
per-pixel alpha the mask wins, since it is what the format calls a sprite's
transparency. The CMYK, JPEG-data, and YCbCr sprite types are refused by name
rather than half-read.

`open_native` reads a picture as its file stores it, for an editor:
a paletted PNG as its indices and palette, a sprite area through
`SpriteAreaReader` — each sprite's `SpriteName`, `SpriteMode` (its eigen
factors, `pixel_aspect` and alpha-mask form) and `SpritePalette` (`Implied`,
`Stored` exactly as read, or `Full`), with a sprite it cannot read handed
back as its bytes (`OpaqueSprite`) rather than refused — and any other format
as RGBA. For a PNG or JPEG, `Unkept` says what the file held that the picture
does not: samples narrowed from 16 bits (`precision`), or data beside the
picture no encoder here writes (`extras`), such as a colour profile, text,
EXIF metadata or an animation's further frames.

## Writing

`encode_png`, `encode_jpeg` and `encode_sprite_area` read a `PictureSource`
a row at a time — `Picture` is the one this crate owns — and refuse anything
their format cannot state (`EncodeError`) rather than approximate it. PNG is
the smallest colour type that holds the picture exactly: a palette is kept at
the shallowest depth that indexes it, a binary mask becomes one transparent
entry, and an unused alpha channel or an all-grey picture is dropped to what
it needs. JPEG is baseline JFIF at a quality of 1 to 100 (`JpegOptions`),
composited over a background, one component for a grey picture and 4:4:4
chroma from quality 90. A sprite area writes each sprite in its own mode —
indexed at the mode's depth with the palette form asked for, or direct colour
in the packing the mode names — with its mask in the form the mode names, and a
kept sprite back exactly but for its length word, refusing one that is not a
whole number of words, which would misplace every sprite after it.
`SpriteMode::with_eig` restates a mode for pixels of another shape, so a
reshaped sprite is written with a mode that agrees. `over` is the one
straight-alpha source-over, which WEBP's animation and an editor's paint both
composite by.

TIFF takes three readings its own text does not settle, all stated in the
module rustdoc. A plain `decode` answers the first page the file does not
call a reduced copy of another (`NewSubfileType`): a TIFF is an ordered
document rather than one picture at several sizes, so its picture is its
first page and not its largest, which is what an icon file's is. The
`Orientation` tag is *applied* rather than reported, so a transposing
orientation swaps the geometry `probe` answers — ignoring it would hand every
consumer a sideways picture and the format knowledge to right it. And a
missing photometric under a fax compression reads as `WhiteIsZero`, which
every fax is.

Refused by name rather than half-read: `BigTIFF`, a separate format with its
own version marker, offset width and directory layout (`sniff` recognises it
so the refusal can say so); the CIE Lab and LogLuv photometrics; old-style
JPEG and word-aligned CCITT; samples of mixed depth or sample format; a fill
order of 2 at any depth but one; separate planes under JPEG or subsampled
chrominance; T.4's uncompressed-mode extension; and a predictor over
subsampled blocks.

- **WEBP** (`ImageFormat::Webp`, WebP Container Specification): the RIFF
  form in both its simple and extended shapes; the `VP8 ` lossy bitstream
  (RFC 6386) complete for the keyframe the container mandates — the boolean
  entropy decoder, the segmentation, loop-filter and quantiser headers with
  their per-segment and per-mode deltas, the token-probability updates, the
  four whole-macroblock luma modes, the four chroma modes and all ten
  subblock modes, the Walsh-Hadamard and DCT reconstructions, both the normal
  and the simple loop filter at macroblock and subblock edges, and the
  conversion to RGB; the `VP8L` lossless bitstream complete — the
  prefix-coded image stream, the meta-Huffman arrangement, the colour cache,
  the LZ77 backward references with their distance mapping, and all four
  transforms; `ALPH` at both compression methods and all four filtering
  methods; and `ANIM` / `ANMF` animation under the container's blend and
  dispose model.

WEBP has a signature, but a two-part one — `RIFF` at 0 and `WEBP` at 8, with
the RIFF size between them — so the format's own module answers the test
rather than `lib.rs` matching a constant. Nothing in the sniff order can
shadow it or be shadowed by it: no other signature opens with `R`, and
requiring both halves means a RIFF form of some other kind is not a WEBP.

The container takes five readings the specification leaves to the decoder,
all stated in its module rustdoc. Its **canvas is authoritative and a
disagreeing bitstream is refused**, because reconciling a 24-bit container
declaration with a 14-bit bitstream one would mean cropping, padding, or
scaling and none of those is what either says; a simple-format file has no
container geometry, so there the bitstream's own size *is* the canvas.
**Nothing is sized from an animation frame's own declaration** — its extent
is checked to lie inside the canvas, which allocates nothing, and the frame
is then decoded at the size its payload declares and refused unless the two
agree. **Which kind a file is comes from the file**: one carrying `ANIM` is
an animation with a loop count, one without is a still picture, because
answering "for ever" would fabricate a declaration. **The canvas clears and
disposes to fully transparent**, ignoring the explicitly-optional background
colour, which is the reading the GIF decoder already takes of *restore to
background*. And the extended header's **alpha and metadata flags are hints
while the chunks present are the fact**, so a set alpha flag with no alpha
chunk decodes and an alpha chunk with a clear flag decodes; the **animation**
flag is not a hint, because it is what says whether the file is an animation
at all, so it and the chunks must agree. The reserved bits and field values
are refused either way.

Refused by name rather than half-read: a `VP8 ` interframe, since the
container requires a keyframe and an interframe predicts against reference
frames a WEBP never carries; an `ALPH` chunk beside a `VP8L` bitstream, which
carries its own alpha; a `VP8L` version other than zero; a reserved alpha
compression method, pre-processing value, or reserved bit; a reserved lossy
colour space, whose one other value names a space this decoder cannot
convert; and the extended form's own chunks in a simple-form file. The lossy
bitstream's scale fields and the alpha chunk's pre-processing field are read,
validated, and then not acted on — all three are display hints, and the last
is called informative, so applying a smoothing or an upscale would fabricate
pixels the file does not hold. Colour profiles and metadata (`ICCP`, `EXIF`,
`XMP `) are read past like any unknown chunk, because nothing here
colour-manages and the output is RGBA8 in the file's own primaries.

Neither WEBP codec has a reduced-scale decode process, so `decode_fitted` on
one is exactly `decode`. That is a property of the formats rather than a gap:
VP8's intra prediction reads full-resolution neighbours, so a coarser
transform would decode a *different* picture rather than a softer one, and
VP8L's spatial predictors and backward references have the same dependency on
the pixels already produced.

The LZW dictionary and expansion loop are shared with the GIF decoder
(`src/lzw.rs`), since the two differ only in how codes are packed and when a
new entry widens the code that follows it. TIFF carries both its own dialect,
which widens one code early, and the classic one older writers emit, which
packs least significant bit first and widens later; they always travel
together and a stream's opening clear code tells them apart exactly. A
JPEG-compressed strip or tile is spliced from the `JPEGTables` field and the
unit's own abbreviated stream and handed to the existing `jpeg` module.

GIF reads the specification literally but for two places, both stated in the
module's own rustdoc: *restore to background* clears to fully transparent
rather than to the declared background colour (every producer means "clear
it", and an opaque colour would flash a box through nearly every real
animation), and a frame's delay is reported exactly as the file gives it,
including zero, because clamping a too-fast animation is a playback decision.

Everything else a JPEG stream can declare is a typed, fail-closed
refusal rather than a best effort: arithmetic coding, lossless and
hierarchical (differential) frames, 12-bit precision, 2- or 4-component
images, a height deferred to a `DNL` marker, and any malformed stream.

Reconstruction inverse-DCTs each block with no per-pixel allocation, at
every scale through a fast fixed-point integer butterfly of that scale's own
size. The full-scale path is the standard AAN / Loeffler-Ligtenberg-Moerlein
separable row-column inverse DCT (the formulation libjpeg names
`jpeg_idct_islow`), in `i32` with the usual descale/rounding shifts and a
flat-block (all-AC-zero) fast path, replacing a direct `O(8^3)` matrix
multiply with `O(8^2)` multiply-adds.

A reduced scale discards the block's high-frequency coefficients and
inverse-transforms the surviving top-left `m`×`m` corner with the
**`m`-point** basis, so its `m` samples span the whole 8-sample block — the
block's band-limited decimation. Re-using the *8*-point basis over that
corner would instead evaluate the block's first `m` spatial positions, a
magnified crop that tiles the image with visible block seams; each reduced
scale therefore has its own butterfly and dequantises only the coefficients
it reads. The arithmetic is `wrapping_*`: for a valid 8-bit frame the
coefficients are bounded and no wrap ever occurs, so the transform is exact,
while a hostile file can at worst wrap an intermediate into the closing
fixed clamp to `0..=255` — never a panic, and never a pixel outside range.

The final assembly reconstructs a subsampled component by **triangle
interpolation** on both axes: a chroma sample sits at the centre of the
output pixels it covers, so an output pixel blends the two chroma samples it
lies between. Replicating each sample instead reproduces the chroma grid as
2x2 blocks of flat colour, and projecting by a bare ratio (skipping the
half-sample centre offset) fringes every hard edge with colour. The taps are
planned once — they are identical for every row — so each component resolves
one output-width row at a time and the per-pixel work is three byte reads and
the colour convert; a component already as dense as the frame is read straight
from its plane.

## API shape

- `sniff(&[u8]) -> Option<ImageFormat>` — identify a format from its
  leading signature. Never answers `Sprite`, which has none.
- `probe(&[u8]) -> Result<ImageInfo, DecodeError>` — the format and natural
  size from the header alone, decoding no pixels. For the caller that cannot
  state its target size until it knows the source's. The reported geometry is
  the file's own claim, so nothing is sized from it here and the caller holds
  it to its own bounds; the header itself is validated by the same parsers a
  full decode uses.
- `decode(&[u8], &DecodeLimits) -> Result<RasterImage, DecodeError>` —
  decode at natural (full) size.
- `decode_fitted(&[u8], &DecodeLimits, FitBox) -> Result<RasterImage,
  DecodeError>` — decode no smaller than it has to be to cover the
  caller's target box (see below).
- `probe_as(ImageFormat, &[u8])` and `decode_as(ImageFormat, &[u8],
  &DecodeLimits)` — the same two, for a caller that already knows the type
  rather than having it sniffed. The only door to a format with no
  signature; `probe` and `decode` are `sniff` plus these.
- `FitBox::new(width, height)` plus `width()`/`height()` — a small public
  copy type carrying the largest output the caller intends to use.
- `DecodeLimits::new(max_width, max_height, max_pixels,
  max_progressive_coefficient_bytes)` plus its accessors.
- `RasterImage::{width, height, pixels, into_pixels}` — the one output
  shape every format decodes into: row-major RGBA8, **straight**
  (non-premultiplied) alpha. `lib/raster`'s `Surface::from_rgba8` is where
  premultiplication happens, once, on the consumer side.
- `Sequence::{open, open_as, info, next_frame, page, rewind}`,
  `SequenceInfo`, `SequenceKind::{Animation, Pages}`, and `Frame` — the
  multi-entry shape (see below). `open_as` names the format, as above.
- `DecodeError` — every fail-closed refusal reason, including a
  `CompressedData` variant wrapping `tairix_compress::zlib::Error`, the
  `Jpeg*` family covering signature, marker, segment, table, entropy,
  scan-header, restart, unsupported-mode, and progressive-store refusals,
  the `Bmp*` and `Ico*` families covering header version, bit count,
  compression, mask, colour-table, pixel-offset, run-length, and directory
  refusals, and the `Tiff*` family covering the byte-order mark and version,
  `BigTIFF`, the directory chain, tag values, unsupported declarations, the
  strip and tile grid, the LZW code, a `TiffCompressedData` variant wrapping
  `tairix_compress::zlib::Error`, and the facsimile refusals.

### Sequences and pages

`Sequence` is the one shape for a container holding more than one picture:
`open` validates the structure and decodes no pixels, `info` answers the
format, the geometry of the picture the container is, the entry count, and
whether the entries are an `Animation { loop_count }` or `Pages`;
`next_frame` decodes the next entry and lends a `Frame` (index, geometry,
declared delay in nanoseconds, pixels); `page` decodes one entry by index;
`rewind` restarts, which is also what makes it safe to step on after a
refusal — a refusal hands out no pixels and is remembered until then, because
an animation's frame that stopped part-way leaves the canvas describing no
whole frame.

It is **forward-only with a rewind**, because that is what an animation *is*.
A GIF frame composites onto whatever its predecessors left on the logical
screen under the disposal method declared for each, so a decoder that could
be asked for frame *n* directly would have to re-composite every frame before
it — wrong per-index, and quadratic over a walk. Holding the canvas and
stepping makes each frame cost its own decode and no more, and the pixels a
`Frame` lends are the canvas *after* compositing, so a consumer never has to
know the format's disposal model. They are borrowed rather than owned for the
same reason: the canvas has to be retained for the next frame, so an owned
buffer per step would copy the whole canvas every frame for nothing.

A **page** container's entries are independent pictures instead, so `page`
addresses one directly and a refused page disturbs no other. An icon file is
the case that matters: its pages are one picture at several sizes, and
choosing between them is the whole point of the format. Addressing a frame of
an *animation* still costs a restart and a walk, which is why a player steps.

A still picture is the **one-entry case** of the same shape, so a consumer
that shows pictures, animations, and icon files needs one path rather than
three. `decode` on a multi-frame container answers its first composited frame
— the picture the format shows first — and on a page container the page that
container means by its picture: an icon file's or a sprite area's largest,
which is what a container of one picture at several sizes means, and a TIFF
document's first non-thumbnail page.

### Reduced-scale decode is a JPEG property, not a shared feature

`decode_fitted` picks the smallest JPEG DCT decode scale — one whole, one
half, one quarter, or one eighth of natural size, produced by inverse-DCT
transforming only the coefficients that scale needs — whose result still
covers the caller's `FitBox` on both axes. It never scales up and never
resamples: reduced dimensions round up, so a result can be modestly larger
than the box but never smaller. Decoding an 8.3-megapixel wallpaper master
straight to an eighth costs a fraction of the full-size arithmetic and
output buffer.

Where that covering scale's own output would breach the caller's
`DecodeLimits`, `decode_fitted` **degrades** to the largest scale that
stays within them rather than refusing — a deliberate trade of a little
sharpness for a decode the caller can afford, never a trade of correctness
or memory safety. The scale is settled from the frame header's declared
geometry before any coefficient store or pixel buffer is allocated, so no
scale is ever attempted, abandoned, and retried, and nothing is decoded
twice. Only when even the one-eighth scale breaches the limits is the image
refused, and then with whichever limit that smallest possible output broke.
`decode` has no such freedom and keeps none: it always means natural size,
and is refused outright when that size breaches the limits.

An icon container has a scale of its own kind: it *is* one picture at several
sizes, so `decode_fitted` takes the smallest page covering the box that stays
within the limits, falling back to the largest that does. Nothing is computed
and nothing is resampled — a page is already the picture at that size.

None of PNG, GIF, BMP, Sprite, and TIFF has such a process — filtered
zlib-compressed scanlines, an LZW code stream, a padded row array, and a grid
of strips or tiles do not separate into scale-selectable passes — so `decode_fitted` on those *is* `decode`, at
natural size, with no scale to degrade to. That asymmetry is an honest
property of the formats, not a gap in this crate: a caller that wants a
smaller one resamples the decoded image through `lib/raster` (the one shared
resampler), exactly as it would to hit a size no JPEG scale lands on.

## Security

Every declared size — a chunk length, a palette entry count, the
decompressed size a PNG's geometry implies, a JPEG segment length,
sampling factor, table index, or spectral band — is validated against the
bytes actually available, or against a size computed purely from
already-bounded geometry, before it is used to allocate or index anything.
`DecodeLimits`' width, height, and pixel-count ceilings are weighed against
the size the decode is about to produce — the declared dimensions for
`decode`, the chosen scale's output for `decode_fitted` — the moment a
format decoder reads the header, before a single scanline, coefficient, or
output pixel is allocated, so a file lying about its size cannot make this
crate reserve memory proportional to the lie rather than the bytes actually
present.

`max_progressive_coefficient_bytes` is the same defence for the one buffer
whose size a JPEG's *mode* rather than its output geometry dictates. A
progressive scan may only refine coefficients an earlier scan already
placed, so no pixel can be produced until the last scan has been read:
every component's every block's every coefficient must be held, at 2 bytes
each, for the whole of the entropy-coded data. A 25-megapixel 4:2:0 image
alone needs roughly 75 MB of that store, which a 1 GiB machine cannot
spend freely. The total is therefore computed in checked 64-bit arithmetic
from the already-validated frame geometry and compared against this bound
**before** the store is allocated; over it, the decode is refused with
`JpegProgressiveCoefficientStoreExceedsLimit`. It is a fixed security
bound, not a growable capacity: this crate never enlarges it to make a
stream fit. A caller that only ever decodes PNG or baseline/extended
sequential JPEG passes `0`, which refuses every progressive stream
outright.

A GIF's frame count carries its own fixed containment bound of 16 384: a
frame block costs about ten bytes, so a small file can declare enormous
numbers of them, and no viewer has use for an animation longer than that. It
bounds the count the structural pass accepts, and nothing is allocated per
frame.

TIFF carries two of the same kind: a page count, because a directory costs
six bytes and a chain that loops revisits one for ever, and a bits-per-pixel
ceiling, because the limits bound the *picture* and without it a page could
declare hundreds of samples behind each of those pixels. The chain walk is
additionally held to the directory entries the file has room for, so it stays
linear in the input, and a strip or tile's own extent is weighed against the
caller's limits like the picture is — a tile is not bounded by the image it
covers, so nothing else would bound the buffer behind one.

Every entry point is total: malformed, truncated, or adversarial input
returns a typed `DecodeError`, never a panic, and every size/offset
computation over untrusted values uses checked, saturating, or widened
integer arithmetic so a crafted input cannot provoke an overflow panic
even in a debug build. The crate is `no_std` + `alloc`,
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and has no dependency beyond `tairix-compress`
(PNG's `IDAT` stream is zlib/DEFLATE, so the `inflate`/`zlib` modules there
are reused rather than re-implemented — the whole-buffer entry points, since
the concatenated `IDAT` chunks are the whole stream).

This crate performs no I/O and holds no authority of its own: it is meant
to run inside the image pipeline's parser sandbox, which supplies the
capability boundary — a crash or resource exhaustion here is contained to
that sandbox, never the calling service.

## Tests

Host-unit-tested beside the code (`src/png_tests.rs`, `src/jpeg_tests.rs`,
`src/gif_tests.rs`, `src/bmp_tests.rs`, `src/ico_tests.rs`,
`src/sprite_tests.rs`, `src/tiff_tests.rs`, `src/ccitt_tests.rs`,
`src/vp8_tests.rs`, `src/vp8l_tests.rs`, `src/webp_tests.rs`,
`src/huffman_tests.rs`, `src/crc32.rs`)
with no external fixture files, the PNG writer they share living in
`src/png_fixture.rs` because an icon entry may be a whole PNG file: the JPEG
tests build their streams marker by marker, check a progressive stream
against the pixels of
the equivalent baseline one, check **every** inverse-DCT scale against a
direct reference the test file restates from the standard's own definition
over many pseudo-random full coefficient blocks (asserting no more than a
one-level per-sample difference), and assert that reducing a block preserves
its mean — the property a scaled transform has and a magnified corner crop
does not. The GIF tests build their streams block by block through one
code-stream writer that mirrors the width schedule a conforming decoder reads
at, and cover every structural variant, the whole disposal model with
hand-verified canvases, an exhaustive check that the four interlace passes
cover every row exactly once, a compressed stream matched against the literal
stream of the same pixels, and every refusal — including every prefix of a
valid file being refused rather than half-decoded. The BMP and icon tests
build every header version, bit depth, encoding, row order, and mask layout
the same way, and cover the run-length escapes, the alpha-versus-mask rule,
page addressing, and a truncated container still answering a page it wholly
holds. The sprite tests build every mode word form, depth, packing, palette
arrangement, mask form, and wastage the same way, and cover the area chain,
page addressing, and every refusal. The TIFF tests write whole documents from
a directory builder and cover every depth, sample format, photometric, plane
arrangement, predictor, orientation and compression, with the facsimile and
LZW streams stated as the bit strings ITU-T T.4 gives rather than re-derived;
the fax tables are additionally checked for being a prefix-free code holding
exactly the runs the specification lists, which is the property a
hand-transcribed table most easily breaks. The WEBP tests write every
bitstream from the two codecs' own fixture writers (`src/vp8_fixture.rs`,
`src/vp8l_fixture.rs`), which follow each specification's own rules rather
than inverting the decoder beside them: the lossy fixture is the *reference
encoder* from RFC 6386, checked by round-tripping several hundred random
probability-and-choice sequences through the decoder, and the lossless one
re-derives the bit order, the canonical code assignment, and the length and
distance prefix mapping. On top of that round trip the lossy tests pin
absolute pixels — a flat keyframe's averaging prediction has nothing to
average, so it fills at 128 and converts to exactly 130 per channel, and one
luma DC token of four spreads through the Walsh-Hadamard transform to lift
every sample by one — and the subblock tests pin where the picture *steps*,
which is what proves the sixteen subblocks were predicted and reconstructed
in scan order against the invented edge values. The lossless tests cover
coded literals, backward references, the colour cache, the meta-prefix
arrangement, and each transform; the container tests cover the chunk walk,
the form rules, every alpha method and filter, the canvas agreement, and the
blend and dispose model. Every format is fuzzed by
`tests/fuzz_image.rs` — random bytes, random bytes behind each valid
signature, and structurally mutated valid fixtures (PNG chunks, JPEG baseline
and progressive marker segments, GIF blocks, icon directory entries, a BMP
header's declared fields, a sprite area's control-block chain, TIFF
directory entries including a rewrite that hands a payload to a compression
it was not written for, and WEBP chunks), each
walked through `decode`, `decode_fitted`, and a full `Sequence` pass with a
rewind. A lossy WEBP is generated as a valid uncompressed header over a
*random* compressed partition: the compressed part is an arithmetic code, so
any byte string decodes to some sequence of boolean choices, and a random
partition therefore walks the whole header — segmentation, the deltas, every
token-probability update flag, the mode trees, and the coefficient tokens —
without the harness restating one of the format's probability tables.
Since a sprite area has no signature, *every* input is additionally
driven through the format-naming door, so the sprite decoder gets the whole
harness's corpus rather than only its own — through
the shared `tests/fuzzseed` seed and budget seam, registered with
`cargo xtask fuzz`.
