//! The per-app configuration document engine (`tairix-appconf`).
//!
//! One document is one [`Document`]: an ordered list of lines, each either a
//! `key = value` setting or text the grammar does not read as one (a comment, a
//! blank line, something a hand edit got wrong). The engine parses such a
//! document, answers typed reads against it, rewrites single settings, and
//! renders it back — with **no I/O**, so the same code serves the app-data
//! daemon, a client, and a host test.
//!
//! Three contracts a caller depends on:
//!
//! - [`Document::set`] rewrites the one line it must and leaves every other
//!   byte — comments, blank lines, the user's own alignment, key order, and
//!   lines the grammar refused — as it found them, so an app that saves its
//!   settings cannot destroy what a user hand-edited in.
//! - A line the grammar cannot read is retained verbatim and reported by
//!   [`Document::unparsed`] instead of aborting the read, so one bad line
//!   cannot cost a user every other setting. That tolerance stops at line
//!   content: the document-level bounds fail closed with a [`ConfError`].
//! - The sealed app-data scope is a document of this format, so the engine
//!   treats a line's bytes as secret unconditionally and wipes every line it
//!   discards. The one copy it does not own is [`Document::render`]'s return
//!   value.
//!
//! The grammar, the bounds table, and why the format is line-oriented are
//! `docs/src/lib/appconf.md`.
