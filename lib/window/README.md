# tairix-window

Stability tier: **experimental**.

The window-channel protocol engine (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW2): the one
definition of the zero-copy, owner-keyed app-window semantics shared by
both ends of the `WINDOW_ENDPOINT` rendezvous, so the desktop session's
server and every app's client can never drift apart.

- **Server** (`WindowServer`): the engine the desktop session composes.
  It decodes each fixed-width `WindowRequest`, attests the in-flight
  caller through the injected `CallerIdentity` seam (the kernel's
  `call_peer_origin` — an unforgeable `ProcId`, never a claimed id),
  keys every window to that owner, maps the app's endpoint-directed
  `shm_grant` region **once** at `Create` through the shared
  `tairix_display::ShmMapper` seam, and hands each `Present` to the
  injected `WindowHost` (the session's compositor bridge) as a
  bounds-checked frame slice plus a validated damage rectangle — no
  per-present mapping, allocation, or copy of its own. A
  `SetBackdropBlur` takes the same owner check and reaches the same
  bridge (`WindowHost::backdrop_blur_set`), so an app frosts the backdrop
  of its own window and of no other. A `Present`, `SetBackdropBlur`, or
  `Close` naming a window the caller does not own is refused `NotFound`
  (no existence oracle); a per-client window cap bounds how much pinned
  memory one app can reserve; a dead client's windows are torn down
  fail-closed via `client_exited`. Routed input is pushed the other way
  with `deliver_event`, which validates the event against the addressed
  window (owner's endpoint, window-local pointer bounds) before handing it
  to the sink. The sink takes the *typed* event, not its wire bytes,
  because only the sink knows whether it goes out now: one that holds an
  event back against a full mailbox folds it by kind and encodes once,
  when it finally goes. A sink that accepts a pick conclusion is answering
  for it either way, which is what clears the pending pick.
- **Client** (`WindowClient` / `WindowEvents`): the app-side half over
  the injected `WindowTransport` seam (the `ipc_call` syscall in
  production). `create` validates and sends the window geometry, grant
  handle, event endpoint, title, and the app's `WindowSizing` — whether it
  is resizable and the smallest client extent it can lay out at, `0`
  declaring none — returning the session-minted window id. The minimum is
  a *declaration*: the window manager enforces it (alongside its own
  furniture floor) so a drag stops there, and an app never clamps a
  granted size by resizing its own window back up, which would fight the
  drag once per pointer sample. `present` sends a frame index plus
  damage, never pixels;
  `set_backdrop_blur` asks for the content behind the window to be
  frosted, a radius in logical pixels with `0` off and anything above
  `WINDOW_BACKDROP_BLUR_MAX_PX` refused at decode; `close` tears the
  window down. `WindowEvents` is the app's event stream over the injected
  mailbox seam — never a poll — decoding each delivered `WindowEvent`
  fail-closed. The seam states its two halves as two traits: `EventDrain`
  (`try_next`, which reads a queued frame and never waits) and
  `EventSource: EventDrain` (`park`, the app's own wait-set park, with
  `next` defaulted as drain-then-park over the pair). An app that
  interleaves work of its own drains with `WindowEvents::try_wait`, serves
  input ahead of that work, and parks only when both are exhausted; an app
  whose loop dispatches several wake sources itself — the terminal
  emulator, with a shell stream per window and an animation deadline;
  Switchboard, with a command mailbox and a sampling deadline — keeps its
  own park and takes the drain alone, and still reads through this one
  stream rather than spelling a mailbox drain of its own.
  `EventMailbox` is that drain against the app's own endpoint, dropping
  any frame of the wrong length or from any sender but the session the
  create reply named: the kernel-attested origin is the authentication,
  and it has one definition rather than one per app. Both paths decode and
  answer a redraw request through one definition, so the polled path
  cannot drift from the parked one. A read that fails says which half
  failed (`EventError::Undecodable` / `EventError::Mailbox`), because the
  answers are opposites — read on past a refused frame, end the channel on
  a dead mailbox — and an `Errno` alone cannot tell them apart
  (`ipc_recv` answers `LengthOutOfRange` for a received length the address
  width cannot hold, which is also a decode refusal). Reading on past a
  dead mailbox would meet the same failure at once and spin.
- **A run of resizes folds to the newest extent.** A client extent is a
  value the window converges on, not an occurrence it must witness, and an
  interactive resize-grab reports one per pointer sample. Every app reads
  through the fold, so an app slower than the pointer lags a frame rather
  than a queue — without it, the samples that piled up during a drag are
  each re-laid-out and re-mapped when the button comes up, and the window
  visibly walks back through the drag before settling.
  `present_damage` decides *what* a round presents from the three cases
  every such app faces (`Repaint::Nothing` / `Reported` / `Whole`), and
  `damage_in` clips a reported client-space rectangle onto the window —
  the app's own fail-closed step, since the session refuses a rectangle
  outside the surface. `pointer_point` widens a wire pointer position into
  the signed geometry the controls hit-test in, saturating rather than
  wrapping, so a coordinate past the range hits nothing. A round that changed the view but reported no
  rectangle presents the whole window: over-covering costs pixels, while
  under-covering would leave a stale frame on screen, because the session
  copies only what a present declares. The
  endpoint's *depth* (`EVENT_MAILBOX_CAPACITY`) is defined here, and its
  *name* beside the other pid-derived endpoints
  (`tairix_abi::window_ipc::event_endpoint_for`), once each, because both
  ends depend on them agreeing: the session reads a refused delivery as
  evidence that the owner has stopped draining, which would mean
  different things per app if each chose its own slack.
- **Popup surfaces** (`WindowRequest::CreatePopup`, `PopupSpec`): an app
  opens an undecorated child surface above one of its own windows, so a
  context menu or a settings sheet is never clipped by the window that owns
  it. `WindowClient::create_popup` takes one `PopupSpec` — the parent
  window, the grant handle, the event endpoint, the frame count and
  geometry, and an offset in physical pixels from the *parent's client
  origin*, since an app is never told its own window's screen position. The
  server validates it exactly as a `Create` and additionally requires that
  the parent is a live window the caller owns (a foreign or unknown parent
  answers `NotFound`, no existence oracle), then hands it to
  `WindowHost::popup_opened` — the session resolves the parent's screen
  position, adds the offset, and clamps the whole popup onto the screen. A
  popup counts against the **same** per-client window cap, so "popup"
  cannot be used to pin more memory than `Create` may. It carries no title
  and no resizable flag: it is never decorated and never listed on the
  taskbar. `present`, `set_backdrop_blur`, and `close` act on a popup's id
  exactly as on a top-level id; closing the **parent** tears down every
  popup keyed to it (as does `client_exited`), while closing the popup's
  own id tears down only the popup. One `PopupSpec` definition serves both
  halves, so the app's request and the engine's validated view cannot
  drift.
- **The seat's desktop is asked for here, and kept current here.** An app
  cannot draw honestly without knowing the screen it is on, the desktop's
  UI scale, and whether the theme runs light or dark — and the compositor
  that owns all three is another process it must not reach into.
  `WindowClient::desktop` asks for them as one `tairix_abi::desktop::
  DesktopInfo`, before the first window is created so the opening frame is
  already the right size at the right density in the right colours; the
  server answers from the injected `WindowHost::desktop`, which reads the
  live compositor rather than a cached copy. The query is read-only and
  carries no capability: it describes the caller's own seat, names no
  other principal's data, and grants no authority. `Desktop` is the
  app-side holder — it resolves the reported percentage into a `Scale`
  (refusing, never clamping, one outside the range `Scale` admits and
  keeping the last good value), reports the screen as a `Rect`, caps a
  wanted window size to it with `fit_window`, and `apply` adopts a
  `WindowEvent::DesktopChanged` (which the session pushes to every live
  window, `WindowServer::window_ids`) and answers whether anything
  changed. One definition of that bookkeeping, so no app repeats it.
- **The redraw handshake is answered here, not in every app.** The
  session may release a window's retained content to reclaim memory and
  then send `WindowEvent::RedrawRequested`. `WindowClient` remembers each
  window's last presented frame index and current extent, so
  `WindowEvents::wait` re-presents that frame with full-window damage
  before handing the event on — one definition of the answer instead of
  one per app. The event is still delivered, so an app that would rather
  render genuinely fresh pixels can; a window that has never presented
  has nothing to re-send and the event is a no-op; a request naming a
  window this client does not hold is refused like any other foreign
  window. An app rendering in place (single-buffered) may re-present a
  partially drawn frame, which is the same tearing it already accepts
  from rendering in place at all.

- **The app-side shell** (`app`, bare-metal targets only): the bring-up
  sequence every windowed `Run` binary repeated verbatim. `RtWindowTransport`
  is the production `ipc_call` transport — it was byte-identical in all seven
  app binaries before it moved here. `bind_event_mailbox` binds the process's
  one event mailbox and builds the wait-set with the machine's
  memory-pressure band already on it, reserving `EVENT_TOKEN` and
  `PRESSURE_TOKEN` so an app numbering its own members from
  `FIRST_APP_TOKEN` cannot collide; `park` / `park_until` wait on that set
  and answer a typed `Wake`, so the *decision* about a band change has one
  definition while the *response* (which caches to hand back) stays each
  app's own. `bring_up_desktop` asks for the seat's desktop and primes a
  `ThemeRegistry` from its appearance. `mode_for` / `region_bytes` /
  `BYTES_PER_PIXEL` shape the window mode and its frame region once, so a
  create, a resize, and every present agree; `region_bytes` is checked rather
  than saturating, because a wrapped length asks for a region too small for
  the window it describes and a saturated one for a region no machine can map
  — and on a 32-bit target the product of two `u32` dimensions genuinely does
  not fit. `ShellError` carries the
  reserved exit code (81–84), the reason, and the typed `Errno` — leaving only
  the application's own name for it to prefix. The errno is carried rather than
  derived from the code, because one code covers several distinct refusals: a
  window already being open and a surface that could not be allocated are both
  `EXIT_NO_WINDOW`, so a service whose own contract answers in `Errno` (the
  Switchboard host) would otherwise have to report an out-of-memory as a
  programming mistake.

  `WindowPane` is **one window**, however many the app has: the id the
  session knows it by, the shared frame region, and the layout both are shaped
  as. `open` and `open_popup` are the create dance — size the region, create
  it, grant it, ask the session — with every refusal unmapping what it had;
  `open_popup` additionally refuses a create reply that did not come from the
  session that opened the parent, closing the window it named rather than
  drawing into it. `present` re-attaches a released region, converts the named
  rectangle of a caller's surface through the one window-frame codec, and
  presents exactly that. `resize`'s ordering is the load-bearing part: the
  spare region is created and granted *first* and adopted only once the
  session has accepted the resize, so a refusal drops the spare and leaves the
  old geometry standing and drawable — it answers `false`, which means "still
  at the old size", never "broken". `resize_with` is the same for a window
  whose picture is a plain `Surface`: the fresh surface is allocated before the
  session is asked and swapped in only once it accepts, the one resize every
  such app — single- or multi-window — makes. `close` answers what the session
  said and consumes the pane either way, so the region is unmapped even on a
  refusal.

  The pane deliberately holds **no picture**. What a window looks like is the
  application's: a plain `Surface` for most, a screen model carrying its own
  cell diff for the terminal emulator. A pane that owned a surface would force
  a second window-sized allocation on every app whose retained picture is not
  literally one.

  `AppWindow` is the **single-window** pairing: the channel, one pane, and the
  surface every frame is drawn into. `present` takes the paint as a closure —
  the shell owns the frame-region and damage bookkeeping without owning a pixel
  of anyone's window — and promotes the damage to the whole window when the
  session has released its copy, since a released region holds none of the
  pixels a partial present would leave standing (`content_released` exposes the
  same fact to a caller that must resolve a reported damage set before
  presenting). `try_present` is the same for a paint that can refuse: a refused
  paint presents nothing and the window keeps its last frame. Either way, a
  rectangle a refused paint or a failed present left torn is re-sent with the
  next present, whose paint is clipped to cover it. `retained_damage` is that
  decision, host-tested: every rectangle is clipped to the window before it is
  painted or recorded, so one named past the surface is sent as the part inside
  it and can never widen later presents into rectangles the frame codec
  refuses. Its `resize` is the pane's `resize_with`, so a window the app could
  not draw into is never left on screen.

  A **multi-window** app (the terminal emulator, the file manager, the viewer)
  holds its own `WindowPane` per window — and per popup — beside whatever
  retained picture it actually paints from, and takes the shell's free
  functions for the rest. `watch_wake` puts a `tairix_rt::work` worker's
  answer wake on the app's wait-set (nothing to watch for a worker that never
  started), `declare_app_bar` declares an icon-bar presence, answering an
  `AppBarRefused` whose words the app states and carries on, and `report` /
  `fail` state a reason on `stderr` under the app's name — so no app spells
  any of them itself.

- **A window's document file** (`document`): where a document came from and
  is saved to, the save in flight and the saves asked for behind it, and a
  file chooser open for it — the sequencing apart from the syscalls, so every
  order is a host test. One save is in flight at a time; plain saves asked in a
  row become one of the latest document, every Save As is its own, and closing
  writes every chained save at once. A save that lands renames the document
  after the file a Save As made, makes it writable and says so, through the
  `SavedDocument` the application's engine implements.
- **An application's own menu** (`menu`): `MenuBuilder` builds the bounded
  `AppMenu` a row at a time, onto the root plate or a submenu, leaving out a
  row the menu cannot hold rather than the whole menu.
- **The document host** (`docapp`): a window per document in one resident
  process. The contract the engine is driven through — `DocumentView`, the
  `Outcome` an input comes to, the `Request`s every document window makes
  alike — is host-tested with the engines. On the bare-metal targets `run`
  is the whole program of an application that edits what the user handed it
  (TextEdit, Paint): opening, closing and quitting with changes asked about
  first, the trusted picker, documents handed over on the icon bar, painting
  only what changed, and the one queue saves are written on in the order
  asked. A save beyond a window's share of that queue grows it by a room for
  as long as the save is outstanding, a closing window keeps a room for each
  save it leaves behind, and the process ends only once every save has landed.
  What differs per application is `DocumentApp`: reading a document in, its
  own requests and workers, and its pixels.
- **A tooltip is asked for once per tool** (`DeclaredTip`): the region a
  window last asked a tip for, so pointer samples over one tool cost no
  further request, and a session that refuses tips is not asked again until
  the tip wanted changes.

The wire format itself lives in `tairix_abi::window_ipc`; this crate adds
the behaviour. Both halves are host-proven in `src/tests.rs` against an
in-process loopback (a real `WindowServer` behind the client seams), so
the request semantics have exactly one tested definition. The production
wiring — the session serving the reserved endpoint from its waitset loop
and the app parking on its event endpoint — lands with the session and
app bundles (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3/AW4).
