//! The app-side shell every windowed `Run` binary composes.
//!
//! Bringing a windowed application up is the same sequence every time: one
//! `ipc_call` transport to the reserved window endpoint, one `port_bind`-bound
//! event mailbox parked on through a wait-set that also carries the machine's
//! memory-pressure band and the desktop's own state, the
//! screen/density/appearance queried before anything is sized, and one
//! retained drawing surface behind a shared frame region that survives
//! resizes and releases. It lives here beside the
//! rest of the app half of the channel so there is one of each rather than one
//! per bundle.
//!
//! # One window or many
//!
//! [`WindowPane`] is one window's channel-side state — its id, its region, its
//! layout — and the protocol over it. [`AppWindow`] pairs one with the retained
//! surface and takes the paint as a closure, which is what a single-window app
//! wants; an app that opens a window per document, or a popup above one, holds
//! panes itself and keeps whatever retained picture it actually paints from.
//!
//! # What stays with the application
//!
//! Its own wait-set members and the tokens for them ([`FIRST_APP_TOKEN`]
//! onward), what it *does* about a pressure-band change or a desktop change,
//! and what it paints.
//! The shell owns the frame-region and damage bookkeeping without owning a
//! single pixel of anyone's window.
