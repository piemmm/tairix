//! The server half: the engine the desktop session composes.
//!
//! [`WindowServer::serve`] handles exactly one received request:
//! decode → caller attestation → owner/bounds validation → action →
//! encoded reply. The hosting session owns the transport (bind the
//! reserved `WINDOW_ENDPOINT`, park on its wait-set, `call_recv` /
//! `call_reply`); the engine owns every decision in between, so the
//! semantics are host-testable against mock seams and identical under
//! any host.
//!
//! # Security shape
//!
//! * **Identity is kernel-attested.** The engine never reads a claimed
//!   owner: [`CallerIdentity::caller`] asks the kernel who the
//!   *in-flight caller of this endpoint* is (`call_peer_origin`'s
//!   unforgeable `ProcId`), and every request is attributed to it
//!   before any state is read or mutated. A kernel-domain caller is
//!   refused outright — a window belongs to a user process instance.
//! * **Windows are keyed to their creator.** A `Present` or `Close`
//!   naming a window the caller does not own answers `NotFound`,
//!   indistinguishable from a window that never existed, so the id
//!   space leaks nothing about other apps' windows.
//! * **Every bound is checked before any pixel access.** The mapped
//!   region must hold every frame at create time, the frame index must
//!   name a created frame, and the damage rectangle must lie inside the
//!   window's surface; each failure is a typed refusal, never a clamp.
//! * **A hostile client is bounded.** At most
//!   [`client_frame_budget_bytes`] of mapped window frame per attested
//!   client — bytes, not windows, because that is the resource a window
//!   actually spends here — so one app cannot pin unbounded shared memory
//!   or flood the taskbar, however large or numerous its windows.
//! * **Teardown fails closed.** [`WindowServer::client_exited`] drops a
//!   dead client's windows (and their region mappings) and tells the
//!   host, so an exited app never leaks a mapped grant or a ghost
//!   taskbar entry.
