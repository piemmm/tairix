//! The application's own event mailbox: the authenticated drain half of its
//! event stream.
//!
//! Every windowed app binds one endpoint for the whole process and reads the
//! session's deliveries from it. The kernel admits only the session serving
//! windows to it, and the kernel-attested origin of each frame — not its
//! content — is still the authentication: a frame of the wrong length, or
//! from any sender other than the session the create reply named, is dropped
//! rather than delivered.
//!
//! That rule lives here so it has one definition rather than one per app.
