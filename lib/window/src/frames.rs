//! The application's half of a window's pixels: the shared frame region it
//! presents from.
//!
//! Every windowed app needs the same three-step dance — create a region,
//! grant it to the reserved window endpoint, hand the grant to `Create` — and
//! the same `unsafe` slice over the mapping it got back. It lives here so
//! there is one of each rather than one per app, and so the *release* path
//! below exists once.
//!
//! # Releasing, and coming back
//!
//! A window's pixels exist three times over: the app's render target, this
//! region, and the session's own converted copy. When nobody can see the
//! window and the machine is short of memory the session gives its copy back
//! and unmaps this region — but the pages only go when *both* sides let go,
//! so it tells the app ([`tairix_abi::window_ipc::WindowEvent::ContentReleased`])
//! and the app answers
//! with [`WindowFrames::release`]. A hidden 4K window then costs nothing
//! instead of sixty megabytes.
//!
//! Coming back is [`WindowClient::frame_pixels`](crate::WindowClient::frame_pixels):
//! the paint that follows the session's next redraw request finds the region
//! released, makes a fresh one, and re-attaches it with the ordinary resize
//! request. The app's paint code does not change.
