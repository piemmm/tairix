//! The window-channel protocol engine (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW2).
//!
//! One crate hosts **both halves** of the `WINDOW_ENDPOINT` protocol
//! over injected seams, so the semantics — what a request means, what is
//! validated, what is refused — have exactly one definition:
//!
//! * [`server::WindowServer`] — the engine the desktop session composes:
//!   decode → caller attestation ([`server::CallerIdentity`]) →
//!   owner/bounds validation → the [`server::WindowHost`] compositor
//!   bridge, plus [`deliver_event`](server::WindowServer::deliver_event)
//!   for the session's app-ward input routing.
//! * [`client::WindowClient`] / [`client::WindowEvents`] — the app-side
//!   half over a [`client::WindowTransport`] and the mailbox seam
//!   ([`client::EventDrain`], plus [`client::EventSource`] where the source
//!   parks), so an app creates, presents, closes, and reads events without
//!   ever polling, plus
//!   [`pointer_input_events`] and [`key_input_event`] — the one
//!   translation from a delivered wire pointer or key event into the input
//!   vocabulary the shared controls consume, so no app carries a private
//!   copy of it.
//!
//! * `app` — the app-side *shell* the windowed `Run` binaries share: the
//!   `ipc_call` transport, the bound event mailbox and its wait-set (with the
//!   machine's memory-pressure band on it), the desktop query, one window's
//!   pane (its id, region, and layout, with the present/resize pair whose
//!   fail-closed ordering leaves the old geometry standing when a resize is
//!   refused), and the single-window pairing of a pane with the retained
//!   surface it is painted from. It links the production pressure seam, which
//!   exists only on the bare-metal targets, so it compiles only there — and is
//!   named here in prose rather than linked, because on a host documentation
//!   build there is no such item to link to.
//!
//! The wire format itself lives in `tairix_abi::window_ipc`; this crate
//! adds the behaviour. Window frames travel through one `shm_grant`ed
//! region mapped once at create time — presents carry a frame index and
//! a damage rectangle, never pixels — and every window is keyed to the
//! kernel-attested `ProcId` of the task that created it, so one app can
//! never touch another's window.
