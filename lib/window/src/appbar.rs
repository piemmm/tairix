//! The icon-bar declaration most windowed applications make.
//!
//! An application declares its presence on the desktop's icon bar through
//! [`WindowClient::set_app_bar`](crate::WindowClient::set_app_bar), and the
//! declaration is an [`AppBar`]: whether it handles the slot's primary click,
//! and the menu a secondary press opens.
//!
//! # The convention, defined here
//!
//! Every icon-bar menu on this desktop reads the same way: the session-drawn
//! **information** row first, the application's own rows next, then a rule and
//! **Quit** last. That order is a desktop-wide convention, so it is written
//! once — in [`declaration`] — rather than restated by each application. An
//! application supplies only the rows in the middle; it cannot place the two
//! ends, so it cannot get them wrong.
//!
//! Most applications have no rows of their own and want the click left to the
//! session so it raises their window: [`info_and_quit`] is that case named.
//!
//! # Components declare differently
//!
//! A bundle the desktop autostarts as a *component of itself* — rather than as
//! an application the user started — makes a different declaration: a permanent
//! slot with the component's own rows, and no *Quit* row at all, because the
//! desktop's own parts are not the user's to close. The session asks for that
//! role with [`DESKTOP_ROLE_SWITCH`] on the command line, which is why the
//! switch is named here beside the declaration it selects: the session that
//! passes it and the bundle that parses it must agree on it exactly, and it is
//! the one thing that tells them apart.
