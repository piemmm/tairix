//! The desktop settings document: its validated model, closed key registry,
//! and the two readings the registry has.
//!
//! One document is one [`DesktopSettings`], in two groups. The *backdrop*
//! keys are the user's chosen wallpaper (or none), how it is fitted to the
//! screen, the colour shown where it does not reach, the desktop icon flow,
//! and the sort order the `Desktop` folder is listed in. The *appearance*
//! keys are how every surface of the desktop is drawn: light or dark,
//! contrast, density, motion, the interface scale, and the cursor set and
//! pointer size the compositor draws with. The *notification* keys are
//! which notices reach the desktop at all, the *input* keys how the pointer
//! and keyboard behave, and the *idle* keys when the screensaver starts, what
//! it shows and how each scene draws, when the display is switched off, and
//! when the screen locks.
//! Every field is a
//! closed value set, and the document itself is a plain `lib/appconf`
//! `key = value` document — the one format engine the app-data store speaks,
//! so this crate defines the *registry* over it and no grammar of its own.
//!
//! The two groups share one document because they share one owner and one
//! published scope: the session writes both, in one round trip, and a
//! desktop half-adopted from two documents is a desktop nobody chose.
//!
//! # Where the document lives
//!
//! In the desktop session's **published** app-data scope
//! (`plans/APPDATA.md` §3.11): the session is the only principal that can
//! write it, because an application publishes only its own scope, and any
//! application of that user may read it through one request shape that
//! cannot name a private one. That is what replaces the hand-rolled
//! `~/Settings/Pinboard/pinboard.conf` path a settings surface used to
//! open directly — the concrete instance of the app-from-app defect the
//! store exists to close.
//!
//! # Two readings, deliberately different
//!
//! [`DesktopSettings::load`] is the **tolerant** one, for a document held
//! in a store: a value the registry refuses leaves that one field at its
//! documented default and is *named* to the caller, so one stale setting
//! costs only itself and never blanks a user's desktop.
//!
//! [`merge`] is the **strict** one, for a document that arrived over a
//! channel: a line outside the grammar, a key outside the registry, or a
//! value outside a key's closed set is a defect in the *sender* rather than
//! something a person typed, and adopting a desktop the sender did not
//! describe is worse than refusing it. It lays the document over what the
//! desktop already holds rather than replacing it, because more than one
//! surface edits the desktop and none of them shows every setting.
//!
//! [`DesktopSettings::document`] renders the canonical form both readings
//! accept: every registry key, in registry order, so a render/read round
//! trip is exact. [`DesktopSettings::document_of`] renders one group, which
//! is what a surface asking for a change posts.
