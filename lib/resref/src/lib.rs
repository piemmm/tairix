//! TAIRiX shared resource-reference parser (`lib/resref`).
//!
//! TAIRiX has no `/dev`, `/proc`, or `/sys`. Non-filesystem resources — the
//! random source, a disk, a serial port, a live metric — are named instead by
//! typed *resource references* such as `sys:random`, `disk:backup@7K2M`, or
//! `stats:net/wan/rx.pps?window=1s`. Several components need to turn such a
//! string into a structured, validated form: the shell first (redirection
//! targets, command arguments, completion, typed shell values), and the
//! resolver services and ABI helpers behind it. That lexing is *identical*
//! wherever it happens, so it lives here once and every consumer imports it,
//! rather than each growing a private reference parser.
//!
//! This crate is a pure *spelling* step: it turns a string into a typed
//! [`ResourceRef`]. It does **not** resolve a namespace to a resource, open
//! anything, check an identity fingerprint, or perform a capability check.
//! Resolution is capability-checked, fail-closed, and owned by the resolver
//! services (the System Information API for `info:`/`stats:`, the device
//! manager and hardware tree for device namespaces); parsing a string here can
//! never widen authority. The typed *resolver* errors (`UnknownNamespace`,
//! `CapabilityDenied`, `IdentityMismatch`, …) are therefore not produced here —
//! this layer only reports that a string is or is not a well-formed reference.
//!
//! # Grammar
//!
//! ```text
//! resource-ref = namespace ":" selector [ "@" guard ] [ "::" facet ] [ "?" params ]
//! selector     = [ selector-part *( "/" selector-part ) ]
//! params       = param *( "," param )
//! param        = key op value
//! op           = "=" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "~"
//! ```
//!
//! A `namespace`, `facet`, and parameter `key` are lowercase ASCII idents
//! (`a-z 0-9 - _`) that start with a letter. Selector parts are case-sensitive
//! (`a-z A-Z 0-9 - _ .`), because full identity selectors carry mixed-case,
//! hyphenated tokens (`disk:id/serial/S6XYZ123456789`). The reserved delimiters
//! `:`, `/`, `@`, `::`, `?`, and `,` are never literal characters inside the
//! part they delimit, so a rendered reference always re-parses to the same
//! value.
//!
//! The `@guard` shorthand may stand alone (`disk:@7K2M`), selecting by short
//! fingerprint within the namespace, and a `?params` query may stand alone
//! (`disk:?removable=true`); a reference with an empty selector and neither a
//! guard nor a query (`disk:`) is rejected.
//!
//! # Bounds and fail-closed behaviour
//!
//! A reference string is untrusted input, so every dimension is a fixed
//! security bound, not a growable capacity: [`MAX_REF_LEN`],
//! [`MAX_NAMESPACE_LEN`], [`MAX_SELECTOR_SEGMENTS`], [`MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`],
//! [`MAX_GUARD_LEN`], [`MAX_FACET_LEN`], [`MAX_PARAMS`], [`MAX_PARAM_KEY_LEN`],
//! and [`MAX_PARAM_VALUE_LEN`]. Anything malformed or over-long is a typed
//! [`RefError`] from [`parse`], never a silently "fixed up" reference. A string
//! with no `:` delimiter is [`RefError::NotAReference`] (it is a filesystem
//! path, owned by the separate path grammar).
//!
//! Parsing is the only fallible step and it never panics. Every operation runs
//! in time linear in the input length, with no recursion, so neither a hostile
//! reference nor a hostile segment can trigger runaway work.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use tairix_resref::{parse, KnownNamespace, Op};
//!
//! let r = parse("stats:net/wan/rx.pps?window=1s").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(r.namespace().known(), Some(KnownNamespace::Stats));
//! assert_eq!(r.selector(), &["net", "wan", "rx.pps"]);
//! assert_eq!(r.params()[0].key(), "window");
//! assert_eq!(r.params()[0].op(), Op::Eq);
//! assert_eq!(r.params()[0].value(), "1s");
//! assert_eq!(r.to_string(), "stats:net/wan/rx.pps?window=1s");
//!
//! // A guarded destructive target and a stand-alone fingerprint shorthand.
//! assert_eq!(parse("disk:backup@7K2M::raw").unwrap().to_string(), "disk:backup@7K2M::raw");
//! assert_eq!(parse("disk:@7K2M").unwrap().to_string(), "disk:@7K2M");
//! ```
