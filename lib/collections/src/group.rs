//! The control-group scan: one metadata byte per slot, examined a group at a
//! time.
//!
//! The hash table stores one control byte beside each slot — [`EMPTY`],
//! [`DELETED`], or the key's seven-bit tag with the top bit clear — and probes
//! by loading [`GROUP_LEN`] of them at once and asking three questions of the
//! whole group: which lanes carry this tag, which are empty (the probe chain
//! ends there), and which are free to take an insertion. [`GroupMatch`]
//! answers all three from one load, so a probe costs one scan per group
//! whether it is looking up or inserting.
//!
//! Two candidates answer it in a handful of vector instructions where the
//! silicon has them; [`scan_portable`] answers it with word-at-a-time bit
//! tricks everywhere else. Which one runs is decided once, by [`resolve`],
//! through the `lib/cpuops` capability gate and its mandatory self-verify — so
//! a vector instruction is never reached on a core that lacks it, and a
//! candidate that disagrees with the portable reference on any vector is
//! structurally unpickable. A build with no candidate at all (every target
//! whose vector unit is off) calls the baseline directly, paying neither the
//! resolved-cell load nor the indirect call.
