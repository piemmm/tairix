//! The heap-backed `no_std` containers that `core` and `alloc` do not
//! provide.
//!
//! `alloc` already gives TAIRiX `Vec`, `String`, `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet`,
//! `VecDeque`, and `BinaryHeap`, and this crate does not re-implement any of
//! them. It holds the containers a kernel runs on that `alloc` has no answer
//! for, each with a caller in the tree (`plans/COLLECTIONS.md` is the ledger
//! of what is landed and what is still to come).
//!
//! The containers that allocate *nothing* live in `tairix-inline` instead —
//! a crate that links neither this one nor `alloc`, so the layer running
//! before a heap exists can use them. This crate depends on it for the inline
//! half of its [`SmallVec`].
//!
//! ## Inventory
//!
//! * [`HashMap`] / [`HashSet`] — expected constant-time unordered lookup, open
//!   addressed over control-byte groups. What `BTreeMap` was standing in for
//!   wherever a key order was never wanted.
//! * [`LruMap`] — the same table with a recency order threaded through it, so
//!   a cache finds and drops its coldest entry without a search. What every
//!   hand-rolled `(tick -> key)` eviction index was standing in for.
//! * [`RangeMap`] / [`RangeSet`] — disjoint half-open ranges, the map holding
//!   each as an identity and the set canonicalising by absorbing everything it
//!   touches. What every hand-rolled `base -> length` reservation table and
//!   its own overlap arithmetic was standing in for.
//! * [`RadixTree`] — a sparse `u64`-keyed index whose every operation costs
//!   its height, with predecessor and successor search and tagged walks. What
//!   a sorted vector updated by shifting was standing in for.
//! * [`SmallVec`] — inline while it is small, spilling to the heap beyond
//!   that, for the paths that carry a handful of elements and pay an
//!   allocation for it.
//! * [`ByteQueue`] — a bounded byte FIFO whose contents stay one contiguous
//!   run, so a stream is parsed or transformed in place where `VecDeque`
//!   would wrap it.
//!
//! ## Rules every container here obeys
//!
//! * **Nothing that can fail panics.** Every allocating operation has a
//!   fallible form returning [`TryReserveError`]; no map has an `Index`
//!   implementation, because a subscript that panics on a missing key has no
//!   place in a kernel.
//! * **No allocation on a read path.** Lookup, iteration, and removal allocate
//!   nothing; growth is amortised.
//! * **No fixed capacity ceiling.** A container here grows on demand and fails
//!   closed only on genuine exhaustion. A caller-chosen compile-time bound is
//!   the other crate's business; the one bound a container here takes is
//!   [`ByteQueue`]'s, which its holder passes at construction as containment
//!   policy.
//! * **Order is unspecified unless the container says otherwise.** A hash
//!   container's iteration order varies with the hash key and the insertion
//!   history; anything compared, logged, or reproduced wants an ordered
//!   container.
//! * **Secret hygiene is the holder's job.** A container does not scrub the
//!   slots it frees — reuse inside one address space is not a security
//!   boundary — so a holder of a key, credential, or capability token stores a
//!   value type that zeroes itself on drop, exactly as `lib/rt`'s heap
//!   already requires. [`ByteQueue`] is the one exception: its element is a
//!   bare byte no holder can make self-zeroing, so it wipes the storage it
//!   releases itself.
