//! The network interface-configuration store engine.
//!
//! TAIRiX keeps its administrator-settable per-interface network
//! configuration in one text document on the encrypted root volume,
//! [`CONFIG_PATH`](`/System/Settings/Network/network.conf`). This crate is
//! the **single definition** of that document: the per-interface line
//! grammar, the closed key registry, each key's typed value set, the
//! bounded fail-closed parser, and the canonical render. The `configure`
//! command app and the installer write the store through this engine and
//! the one reader — the `netstack` service, at start and on a typed
//! `CAP_NET_ADMIN` reload — reads it through the same engine, so the two
//! can never diverge.
//!
//! The store is parsed only **after** the operator's `Root filesystem
//! passphrase:` unlocks the encrypted root — it lives inside
//! `/System/Settings`, which does not exist before the mount — so an absent
//! store simply means "no managed interfaces beyond loopback"
//! ([`NetworkConfig::default`]), never an error.
//!
//! # Grammar
//!
//! The text is a sequence of lines. A `#` begins a comment that runs to the
//! end of the line; blank and comment-only lines are ignored. Every other
//! line is one setting: a key of the shape `<iface>.<suffix>`, whitespace,
//! and that key's value. The `<iface>` part is an admin-chosen interface
//! *alias* (`wan`, `lan0`) — a stable name bound to hardware by identity
//! (`<iface>.match.mac` / `<iface>.match.node`), never a discovery-order
//! name. The `<suffix>` is drawn from the closed [`IfaceKey`] registry.
//! Each `(iface, suffix)` pair may appear at most once.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! The store text is **untrusted input** to every consumer: the parser is
//! bounded ([`MAX_CONFIG_LEN`], [`MAX_INTERFACES`], [`MAX_BOND_MEMBERS`]),
//! allocation-bounded, and fails closed ([`ConfigError`]) on anything it
//! does not fully understand — an unknown key, an out-of-set or malformed
//! value, a duplicate, an oversized document, or a semantically
//! inconsistent interface (a `bond.*` key on a non-bond, a static address
//! without the matching `static` method). A `netstack` that cannot fully
//! parse the store keeps its running configuration untouched rather than
//! guessing at a partial intent; the write path (`configure`) refuses the
//! edit outright. The engine itself performs no I/O and holds no authority:
//! reading and writing the file go through the secured VFS under the
//! caller's own kernel-attested identity, and the per-inode policy on
//! `/System/Settings` decides who may write.
