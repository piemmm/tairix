//! Integer screen geometry: points and rectangles (`lib/geometry`).
//!
//! This crate is the single shared definition of the desktop's integer
//! coordinate types. It is consumed by the compositing window manager
//! (`userland/gui/wm`), the taskbar (`userland/gui/taskbar`), and the
//! default graphical apps, none of which may depend on one another; shared code therefore lives in `lib/*`, exactly
//! as `lib/theme` is the shared home for design tokens.
//!
//! Screen coordinates are signed (`i32`): a window may be positioned partly
//! off the top or left edge. Sizes are unsigned (`u32`). All arithmetic is
//! overflow-checked through `i64`/`u32` widening so a pathological
//! coordinate fails closed rather than wrapping.
//!
//! [`Region`] extends the vocabulary from a single rectangle to a *set* of
//! pixels held as disjoint rectangles: which pixels changed, which a control
//! owns, which survive a clip. That is geometry, not rendering — the colour
//! algebra stays in `lib/raster` — so damage tracking and control repaint
//! reporting share one definition instead of a copy each.
//!
//! The crate also owns [`Scale`], the desktop's single DPI / UI scale factor:
//! desktop lengths are authored in *logical* pixels at a reference density
//! and converted to a panel's *physical* pixels through one shared
//! [`Scale::scale_length`], so variable-DPI support is not re-implemented per
//! consumer.
//!
//! [`GridRun`] is the one placement of equal cells along an axis, and
//! [`GridFill`] what a line of them does with the space left over, so every
//! grid of tiles on the desktop lays out and hit-tests through one arithmetic.
