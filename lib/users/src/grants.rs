//! The standard account capability-grant sets
//! (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` §4.2, §4.3).
//!
//! An account's grant ceiling is authored into its
//! `/System/Security/Users` record by the image builder (`tools/mkimage`),
//! the installer, and — later — a `CAP_USER_ADMIN` holder. The two sets
//! every author composes from are policy, not per-author choice, so they
//! are defined here once beside the record format that stores them and
//! imported everywhere (the image builder's debug profile, the disk-image
//! test fixtures, and the kernel's session-program manifest), never
//! copy-pasted.
//!
//! * [`SESSION_BASELINE`] — what every interactive account is granted so
//!   an ordinary session works at all.
//! * [`ADMINISTRATIVE_SET`] — the additional grants that make an account
//!   an administrator. There is no admin flag, no wheel group, and no
//!   special uid: an administrator is exactly an account whose ceiling
//!   carries these capabilities.
//! * [`administrator_ceiling`] — the union of the two, the ceiling an
//!   administrator account (the debug image's `root`, the installer's
//!   first user) is seeded with.
//! * The per-service ceilings ([`DEVMGR_CEILING`], [`SYSINFOD_CEILING`],
//!   [`SEATMGR_CEILING`], [`LOGIN_CEILING`]) — each service account's
//!   grant ceiling holds exactly its own service's needs, so the
//!   ceiling∩manifest intersection does real work: a compromised service
//!   cannot borrow a sibling's authority even if its manifest lied
//!   (`plans/USERS.md`).
//!
//! Driver-class (`CAP_MEM_DMA`, `CAP_IRQ_BIND`, …) and service-class
//! (`CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER`, `CAP_USERS_READ`, …) capabilities are never part
//! of an *interactive* account ceiling: they belong to the specific system
//! program whose manifest requests them — and, through that service's own
//! no-login account, to its dedicated per-service ceiling. An
//! administrator administers the system; they do not impersonate its
//! services.
//!
//! `CAP_LOG_EMIT` is the one capability that is both baseline and part of
//! several per-service ceilings. It is not service-class: writing a
//! diagnostic record about one's own program is something an ordinary
//! session does, and a service ceiling lists it for the same reason an
//! interactive one does, not as a privilege the service alone holds.

/// The session baseline: the class capabilities every interactive
/// account's ceiling must include for an ordinary session to work.
///
/// * `CAP_FS_ACCESS` — "may use the filesystem at all"; real reach stays
///   per-inode, so a baseline holder still cannot write `/System`.
/// * `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` — "may run programs at all"; the child is bounded by
///   its *own* manifest intersected with this same ceiling.
/// * `CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN` — the narrow authority to start a *kernel-branded,
///   capability-empty parser child and nothing else*. It grants an
///   interactive account nothing it did not already have, because
///   `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` above already subsumes it: what it buys is that a
///   program of that account can *request* the narrow authority in its own
///   manifest instead of general spawn, and have it survive the
///   ceiling∩manifest intersection. Without it in the ceiling that
///   intersection is empty and such a program would be forced to ask for
///   the far broader `CAP_PROC_SPAWN` to decode an untrusted file — exactly
///   the escalation the narrow capability exists to avoid.
/// * `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` / `CAP_CONSOLE_READ` — an interactive session's
///   inherited standard streams are console-backed; the fine authority
///   stays the inherited descriptor table.
/// * `CAP_DISPLAY` / `CAP_INPUT_READ` / `CAP_SHM` — the graphical session
///   class (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` §4.6): acquiring a seat's exclusive,
///   revocable display lease, draining the *owned* seat's input channels,
///   and creating/granting the zero-copy frame region the display service
///   maps. The class capability only admits the syscall; the kernel still
///   owner-gates every acquire, drain, and present against the live lease
///   and every region against its owner, so a baseline holder gains no
///   reach into another session's seat or memory. Granted in the baseline
///   because a graphical login is an ordinary session, not an
///   administrative act; on a headless build there is no seat to acquire
///   and the grants are inert.
///
/// * `CAP_DESKTOP_LAYER` — presence on the desktop outside a window of
///   one's own: a small undecorated surface placed in screen coordinates,
///   stacked above or below other applications' windows, with the terrain
///   and pointer feeds that placement needs (`plans/CINDER.md`). Baseline
///   because a desktop companion is an ordinary thing for a user to run,
///   not an administrative act, and because the ceiling is not what bounds
///   it: the intersection with a *signed* manifest is, so only a bundle
///   whose manifest asks for it can ever obtain one. The containment is
///   structural and lives in the session — bounded surface size, never
///   keyboard-focusable, pointer caught only on opaque content, and both
///   feeds stopped whenever a trusted surface is up — so a baseline holder
///   gains no way to reproduce or observe a credential prompt. On a
///   headless build there is no session to serve it and the grant is inert.
/// * `CAP_NET` — ordinary network use: opening datagram sockets and
///   originating/receiving transport traffic through the `netstack`
///   socket surface (`plans/NETWORK.md` §0). Baseline because using the
///   network is an ordinary part of an interactive session, not an
///   administrative act; the coarser `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (reconfiguring
///   interfaces) and `CAP_NET_RAW` (unmediated raw frames) are not
///   baseline. A program still only receives it if its own manifest
///   requests it, intersected with this ceiling.
/// * `CAP_LOG_EMIT` — emit one bounded, kernel-validated diagnostic
///   record through `log_emit`. It reaches the kernel's **diagnostic**
///   sink only; the hash-chained security audit log stays kernel-only, so
///   no program a user runs can forge, alter, or truncate an audit entry,
///   and the kernel — never the caller — attributes each record to the
///   calling task, so a record cannot be mis-attributed. The cost is
///   real and is accepted deliberately: any program a logged-in user runs
///   may now write to the machine-wide diagnostic log, so log noise and
///   provenance confusion are possible, and on a debug build the captured
///   serial line is user-writable. It is baseline anyway because a
///   session — graphical or text — legitimately reports its own
///   operational state, and a session that is built to log but structurally
///   cannot is a program that fails silently. A program still only
///   receives it if its own manifest requests it, intersected with this
///   ceiling.
///
/// Nothing else is baseline: self-scoped `sysinfo` queries, `stream_*` on
/// inherited descriptors, lowering one's own resource limits, and
/// `fs_getcwd` already require no capability. A sandboxed process still
/// gets none of this, because its manifest requests none of it.
///
/// This is an **account ceiling**, never any program's manifest: each
/// program requests exactly its own exercised set (the shell's is the
/// kernel's `SHELL_MANIFEST`, which stays strictly within this ceiling;
/// the desktop session's is the graphical class), and the intersection
/// with this ceiling does the security work.

/// * `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` / `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` / `CAP_SYSINFO_HW` —

/// * `CAP_TIME_SET` — adjust the wall clock.
/// * `CAP_TIME_HIRES` — the full-resolution monotonic clock
///   (diagnostics and profiling).
/// * `CAP_MEM_PIN` — exempt a process's anonymous memory from the swap
///   tiers (`mem_pin`, bounded by the `pinned-memory-bytes` limit): the
///   operator-diagnostics power the monitoring and load-generation tools
///   request in their manifests, grantable only through a ceiling that
///   carries it.
/// * `CAP_NET_ADMIN` — administer the network stack: interface, address,
///   and route mutation through the `netstack` admin surface
///   (`plans/NETWORK.md` §3).
/// * `CAP_NET_BIND_PRIVILEGED` — bind a listening socket to a well-known
///   (privileged) port below the privileged-port bound (`netstack`'s
///   `Bind` gate, the Unix `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` model): running a
///   privileged network service is an administrative act, so an
///   administrator's ceiling may grant it to a program whose manifest
///   requests it. Ordinary transport use stays baseline `CAP_NET`.
/// * `CAP_NET_RAW` — unmediated raw network access: raw frames and the
///   ICMP/ICMPv6 echo socket the diagnostic `ping` tool opens (`netstack`
///   gates that socket on it). Reaching below the transport layer is an
///   administrative act — the Unix `CAP_NET_RAW`/setuid-`ping` model — so
///   an administrator's ceiling may grant it to a program whose manifest
///   requests it (`ping`), while ordinary transport use stays baseline
///   `CAP_NET`. It is the network stack service's defining capability
///   among the *service* ceilings; carrying it here widens only what an
///   *administrator account* may be granted, never any service's identity.
/// * `CAP_PROC_CONTROL` — signal a process owned by a *different*
///   principal (`signal`'s cross-principal path,
///   `plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T11). A process may always signal its own
///   live children, or any other process it itself owns, without this
///   capability; controlling a process that belongs to someone else is an
///   administrative act, not an ordinary session's.
/// * `CAP_SYSTEM_POWER` — power the machine off or restart it
///   (`system_power`, `plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T13). Ending every other
///   principal's session and every service on the machine reaches far
///   beyond the caller's own processes, so it is administrative; an
///   ordinary session ends only its own work.
/// * `CAP_STORAGE_ADMIN` — compose raw storage devices and destroy the
///   on-disk metadata that says how they are composed: creating a RAID
///   array, admitting or retiring a member, stopping an array
///   (`plans/FIX-IO.md` `IO6f`). It overwrites disks and changes what a
///   mounted filesystem is made of, so it belongs to whoever administers
///   the machine's storage rather than to any session that merely uses it.
/// * `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` — drive a service manager's runtime lifecycle
///   over its control endpoint (`servicectl`). Stopping the device manager,
///   the network stack, or the clock affects every principal on the machine
///   rather than the caller's own work, so it is administrative; an ordinary
///   session holding it could disable most of the system.
/// * `CAP_NET_DISCOVER_ALL` — browse the link for every service type, and
///   enumerate the types themselves (`dns-sd`, `plans/ZEROCONF.md` Z4).
///   Listing what every host on a segment offers is the reconnaissance
///   class `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` guards for processes; an ordinary program
