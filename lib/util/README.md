# `tairix-util`

Stability tier: **experimental**.

The strictly justified shared-utility crate (`AGENTS.md` §3): every item
is used by two or more independent crates, and promoting code into it
requires a `PLAN.md` note naming those callers. `no_std` (the C-locale
engines use `alloc`; `fmt` and `size` are allocation-free) and
panic-free throughout; every member carries its unit tests next to the
code.

## Members

* `conf` — the `#`-comment line grammar every line-oriented
  configuration store shares (`strip_comment`: a `#` opens a comment
  that runs to the end of the line). Consumers: `lib/sysconfig`,
  `lib/netconfig`, `lib/enrolment`, `lib/users`, `lib/fontface`,
  `lib/proglib`, `lib/syntax`, and `userland/system/init`'s startup list.
* `cfloat` — C-locale `printf(3)` floating-point rendering
  (`FloatDirective`: flags, width, precision, `efga`/`EFGA`
  conversions, rendered exactly as C prints a `double`). Consumers: the
  `seq` and `printf` command apps (`plans/APPS.md`).
* `cnum` — C-locale `strtod(3)` scanning (`scan_double`:
  longest-prefix `endptr` semantics, decimal and hexadecimal floats
  with exact one-step rounding, `inf`/`nan`). Consumers: the `seq` and
  `printf` command apps.
* `fallible` — reserving a data-sized buffer before filling it
  (`filled`, `collected`, `grow_to`, `reserve`), so an image- or
  payload-sized allocation the machine refuses is a typed refusal rather
  than an allocation abort. Consumers: `lib/raster`, `userland/gui/wm`,
  `lib/image`.
* `fmt` — no-allocation numeric formatters for structured-log field
  values. Consumers: `kernel/sec`, `kernel/ipc`.
* `size` — the GNU coreutils size vocabulary: `-B`/`--block-size`
  parsing (`SizeScale`), ceiling block scaling (`blocks_ceil`), and the
  `human_ceiling` renderings (`format_human`, powers of 1024 or 1000).
  Consumers: the `du` and `df` command apps (`plans/APPS.md`).
* `count` — the GNU count grammar for `-c`/`-n` values
  (`parse_decimal`, and `parse_suffixed` for the multiplier alphabet).
  Consumers: the `head` and `tail` command apps (`plans/APPS.md`).
* `defer` — handing slow work off an interactive loop (`JobDesk`: one
  request waiting, one in flight, one answer landed; latest-wins, and the
  displaced request handed back so no caller waits for an answer nobody
  will produce. `JobQueue`: every request answered, in turn). Consumers:
  the terminal's and the desktop session's settings publishers, the
  session's program-catalogue scan and file calls, the file manager's
  bundle scan and occupancy probes, and TextEdit's document queue.
* `hexdump` — the canonical offset/hex/ASCII dump row. Consumers:
  `fstree` and TextEdit's hex view.
* `lanes` — finding a byte eight lanes of a word at a time. Consumers:
  `lib/collections` and TextEdit.
* `argv` — resolving a value-taking option's attached or following value.
  Consumers: `mount`, `passwd`, `useradd`, `usermod`, and `groupadd`.
* `mathf` — bounded, total `f64` maths for `no_std` geometry, with no
  external libm and the same bits on every target. Consumers:
  `lib/fontface`, `lib/svg`, `lib/raster`, `lib/audio`, `cinder`, WinterSun,
  and the desktop session's screensavers.
* `retry` — `RetryLadder`, a bounded doubling one-shot schedule for
  waiting on something with no readiness event, and `RestartPacer`, a
  capped doubling delay between restarts of something that keeps dying,
  forgotten after a stable window. Consumers: `timed` and PID 1's enrolment
  reads (the ladder); PID 1's restart policy and `lib/sandbox`'s supervised
  worker (the pacer).
* `tailwindow` — the bounded rolling "keep the last N bytes/lines"
  windows (`ByteWindow`, `LineWindow`), so a last-N view costs memory in
  N rather than in the input. Consumers: the `head` and `tail` command
  apps.
* `utf8` — which bytes begin a UTF-8 sequence and how long it is
  (`sequence_len`, Unicode Table 3-7). Consumers: `lib/syntax`, `wc`, and
  TextEdit.
