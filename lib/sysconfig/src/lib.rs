//! The boot-time system-configuration store engine.
//!
//! TAIRiX keeps its administrator-settable boot-time configuration in one
//! text document on the encrypted root volume,
//! [`CONFIG_PATH`](`/System/Settings/Configuration/system.conf`). This crate
//! is the **single definition** of that document: the line grammar, the
//! closed key registry, each key's typed value set, the fail-closed parser,
//! and the canonical render. The `configure` command app writes the store
//! through this engine and every boot-time consumer (the login service's
//! `os.loginType`, today) reads it through the same engine, so the two can
//! never diverge.
//!
//! The store is parsed only **after** the operator's `Root filesystem
//! passphrase:` unlocks the encrypted root — it lives inside
//! `/System/Settings`, which does not exist before the mount — so a
//! pre-unlock consumer simply runs on defaults ([`SystemConfig::default`]).
//!
//! # Grammar
//!
//! The text is a sequence of lines. A `#` begins a comment that runs to the
//! end of the line; blank and comment-only lines are ignored. Every other
//! line is one setting: a key from the closed registry, whitespace, and a
//! single value from that key's closed value set. Keys may appear at most
//! once. The registry today:
//!
//! * `os.loginType` — `text` or `graphical` (default): which session type
//!   the login service offers as the boot default (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D7d).
//!   The graphical default still degrades to the text prompt on a machine
//!   that cannot run one — no live display service, no desktop bundle, or
//!   no login-screen bundle — never an error.
//! * `cache.all` — `on` (default) or `off`: the master caching switch. `off`
//!   is a ceiling that disables every SMARTRAM cache regardless of the
//!   per-class settings below.
//! * `cache.filesystem`, `cache.block`, `cache.transform`, `cache.semantic` —
//!   `auto` (default) or `off`: the per-class caching switches for the four
//!   live SMARTRAM caches (`plans/SMARTRAM.md`). `auto` lets the memory-
//!   pressure governor manage the class (today's behaviour); `off` hard-
//!   disables it (a real bypass — the cache admits and holds nothing). There
//!   is deliberately no per-class `on`: a class cannot be forced to ignore
//!   memory pressure without breaking the SMARTRAM reserve invariants. The
//!   effective mode of a class is `off` whenever `cache.all` is `off`, else
//!   the class's own value (see [`SystemConfig::effective_cache`]).
//! * `net.ipv4.enabled`, `net.ipv6.enabled` — `true` (default) or `false`:
//!   the stack-wide address-family switches (`plans/NETWORK.md` section 6.2).
//!   A disabled family binds no addresses, answers no packets, and refuses
//!   family-specific socket creation with a typed error — fail closed, not a
//!   silent drop.
//! * `net.ipv6.privacy` — `true` or `false` (default): whether the stack
//!   forms RFC 8981 temporary (privacy) IPv6 addresses in addition to the
//!   stable SLAAC address.
//! * `net.tcp.syncookies` — `auto` (default) or `always`: the SYN-flood
//!   defence policy. `auto` keeps a bounded half-open queue and falls back to
//!   stateless cookies on overflow; `always` answers every SYN statelessly.
//!   There is deliberately no `off`: an undefended SYN queue is a security
//!   regression, never a configuration.
//! * `net.tcp.keepalive` — `true` or `false` (default): whether TCP
//!   connections send RFC 9293 §3.8.4 keepalive probes on an idle link. When
//!   enabled, every connection is probed after the standard idle interval and
//!   torn down if the peer stops answering; `false` (RFC 1122 §4.2.3.6) never
//!   probes and never tears an idle connection down for inactivity.
//! * `net.tcp.ecn` — `true` or `false` (default): whether TCP connections
//!   negotiate RFC 3168 Explicit Congestion Notification. When enabled, a
//!   connection offers ECN in its SYN/SYN-ACK and, once negotiated, marks
//!   eligible segments ECT(0) and treats a CE mark as a congestion signal
//!   instead of forcing a drop; `false` leaves connections Not-ECT.
//! * `net.sockets.mem` — `auto` (default) or a byte size such as `64M`:
//!   the network stack's socket-memory budget, in *bytes* rather than a
//!   count of sockets, because bytes are what a socket actually costs. The
//!   same budget therefore carries a great many idle sockets or far fewer
//!   fully-buffered connections, according to the workload, instead of the
//!   stack provisioning for one and refusing the other. `auto` sizes it
//!   from the machine's usable physical RAM; a size is the administrator
//!   overriding that. Each principal may hold a sixteenth, so the stack
//!   always has room for sixteen. There is deliberately no `unlimited`:
//!   the budget bounds the stack's own heap, and a bound that can be
//!   switched off is not one.
//! * `time.servers` — `none` (default) or a comma-separated list of at most
//!   [`MAX_TIME_SERVERS`] network time servers, each a host name or an
//!   address literal (`plans/TIMESYNC.md` §3). This key is the *operator's*
//!   choice and outranks every other source; `none` means they expressed
//!   none, not that the machine never queries — the clock service then
//!   prefers what DHCP offered, and failing that its own built-in
//!   public-pool fallback.
//! * `input.mouse.debounce` — whole milliseconds, `25` by default, `0` to
//!   disable: how long after a pointer button is released the *same* button's
//!   next press is treated as switch chatter rather than a distinct click. A
//!   worn switch can emit a second press a few milliseconds after release that
//!   the device meant as one click, and the seat cannot ask the device which it
//!   meant. Bounded by [`MAX_CLICK_DEBOUNCE_MS`]. Set it to `0` for a device
//!   whose rapid-fire mode deliberately emits click pairs at ~10 ms: that is
//!   real user intent and must not be suppressed. Motion and scroll are never
//!   debounced.
//! * `time.refresh` — `6h`, `12h`, `1d` (default), `2d`, or `7d`: how much
//!   *uptime* passes between steady-state re-queries. A closed set rather
//!   than a free-form span, so no configuration can ask for a cadence that
//!   abuses a public server; the client's own hard floor applies on top.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! The store text is **untrusted input** to every consumer: the parser is
//! bounded ([`MAX_CONFIG_LEN`]), allocation-free, and fails closed
//! ([`ConfigError`]) on anything it does not fully understand — an unknown
//! key, a value outside the key's set, a duplicate, or an oversized
//! document. A boot-time consumer that cannot fully parse the store runs on
//! defaults rather than guessing at a partial intent; the write path
//! (`configure`) refuses the edit outright. The engine itself performs no
//! I/O and holds no authority: reading and writing the file go through the
//! secured VFS under the caller's own kernel-attested identity, so only a
//! principal the per-inode policy admits (the system administrator) can
//! change the store.
