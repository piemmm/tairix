//! Deterministic fuzz harness for the split-virtqueue completion path
//! against a hostile virtio device (of the security
//! charter, CWE-1257 / Thunderclap-class).
//!
//! `SplitQueue::poll_used` consumes the **device-written** used ring, and the
//! device can DMA over the descriptor table it reads. In the threat model those
//! bytes are attacker-controlled: a buggy or malicious device may name a head
//! outside the table, the head of no chain it holds, a chain it already
//! returned, or scribble chain links. Per ("every parser of untrusted
//! input... has a fuzz target") the consumer is driven here against arbitrary
//! device-supplied completions interleaved with honest chain publication.
//!
//! TAIRiX does not pull in an external fuzz runner: a deterministic,
//! per-run-seeded PRNG drives random chains, heads, lengths, and
//! descriptor-table corruption through the in-process [`MockTransport`]
//! hostile-device seams, against a model of which chains the device holds, and
//! asserts the invariants the driver must uphold no matter what it writes:
//!
//! 1. `poll_used` never panics and never dereferences a descriptor outside the
//!    granted table (the run aborting would be the failure).
//! 2. **Fail-closed attribution**: a completion is accepted exactly when it
//!    names the head of a chain the device holds, and is then that chain's,
//!    and every other head is rejected with
//!    [`VirtioError::MalformedCompletion`], reclaiming nothing.
//! 3. **Conservation**: however the device corrupts the table, every
//!    published chain is built from descriptors no held chain owns, as the
//!    table reads right after publication, and the free count plus the
//!    descriptors of every held chain is exactly the queue size — no
//!    descriptor is lost, and none is handed out twice.
//!
//! ## Wall-clock budget
//!
//! A plain `cargo test` runs the [`SMOKE_ITERATIONS`] sweep once from a fresh,
//! logged seed. When
//! `cargo xtask fuzz` exports `TAIRIX_FUZZ_BUDGET_SECS`, the harness keeps
//! drawing from the *same continuing* PRNG stream until the budget
//! elapses, while the logged seed keeps any failure reproducible.
