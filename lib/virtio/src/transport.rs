//! [`Transport`] trait.
//!
//! A [`Transport`] is the bus-arch-specific seam every virtio driver
//! talks to. The trait defines the minimum surface required to bring
//! a split-virtqueue device online per virtio 1.1 §3.1:
//!
//! 1. Reset → acknowledge.
//! 2. Feature negotiation (driver-features bitmap).
//! 3. Set `FEATURES_OK`; abort if the device clears it.
//! 4. Per-queue programming (`queue_select` → `queue_set`).
//! 5. Set `DRIVER_OK`.
//! 6. Notify a queue when a chain is published.
//!
//! The in-process `MockTransport` peer the tests drive is built only for
//! tests, behind the crate's `mock` feature.
