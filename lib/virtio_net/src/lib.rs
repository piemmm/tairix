//! TAIRiX arch-neutral virtio-net link-layer device logic.
//!
//! Implements [`tairix_abi::driver::net::Net`] on top of the
//! cross-arch virtio transport from `lib/virtio`. As with
//! `virtio_blk`, the device logic is bus-agnostic: the same source
//! compiles against the PCI and MMIO transports
//! — the queue protocol lives once, in the transport crate.
//!
//! This is a `lib/*` device-logic crate (the `lib/virtio_input` precedent): the
//! virtio-net driver crate (`drivers/network/virtio_net`) links it, and so do
//! the host tests and the QEMU verticals, so the device engine is written once
//! and never re-implemented. Living in `lib/*` (rather than a `drivers/*`
//! crate) is what lets a future user-space driver *process* link the engine
//! directly: a process crate may depend on `lib/*` but never on another
//! `drivers/*` crate.
//!
//! # Wire protocol
//!
//! Virtio-net 1.1. A `struct virtio_net_hdr` prefixes every transmit
//! and receive descriptor chain; the device publishes its MAC through
//! the device-configuration window. Two queues are used: receive queue
//! `0` and transmit queue `1` (virtio-net §5.1.2). When mergeable
//! receive buffers (`VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF`) are negotiated the header
//! is the 12-byte `virtio_net_hdr_mrg_rxbuf` on both rings; otherwise it
//! is the 10-byte `virtio_net_hdr`.
//!
//! Two checksum-offload features are negotiated when the device offers
//! them. Receive (`VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_CSUM`): the device may mark a
//! received frame checksum-validated (`VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_DATA_VALID`) or
//! deliver it with a partial checksum (`VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM`);
//! the driver reports which, per frame, through the ring's offload
//! metadata ([`tairix_abi::driver::net_ring::FrameOffload`]) and the
//! stack skips or completes the fold. Transmit (`VIRTIO_NET_F_CSUM`):
//! the stack may hand a TCP segment carrying only the partial
//! (pseudo-header) checksum ([`FrameOffload::TxChecksum`]), and the
//! driver sets `VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM` + `csum_start`/`csum_offset`
//! so the device completes it (`plans/NETWORK.md` §2.3). Segmentation
//! (`VIRTIO_NET_F_HOST_TSO4`+`TSO6`): the stack may hand the device one
//! over-size TCP super-segment ([`FrameOffload::TxSegment`]) to split on
//! the wire. The driver does no checksum or segmentation arithmetic
//! itself — it never links the stack — so the kernel that links this
//! crate for the device id stays free of `lib/net`.
//!
//! Mergeable receive buffers (`VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF`) are negotiated
//! when offered: the driver posts a *pool* of receive buffers (so a
//! burst is captured before the stack next services the ring, rather
//! than the device dropping everything past a single outstanding buffer)
//! and reassembles a frame the device delivered across several buffers,
//! reading the buffer count from the first buffer's `num_buffers`. A
//! ≤MTU frame arrives in one buffer; reassembly is bounded to one link
//! frame and fails closed on an over-long or corrupt merge.
//!
//! Higher-layer protocols (ARP, IP, ICMP) live above this trait in
//! user space and are out of scope for `abi-v1` (see
//! `lib/abi/src/driver/net.rs`).
//!
//! # Public surface
//!
//! [`VirtioNet`] is the device engine: a consumer brings it up with
//! [`VirtioNet::open`] and drives frame I/O through the [`Net`] trait.
//! The driver-host `register` shell that wraps it (and the load-time
//! `CAP_DRV_LOAD` gate) lives in the `tairix-drv-network-virtio-net`
//! crate, which re-exports this type.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! This crate holds no capability checks: it is pure device logic. The
//! dispatcher above it verifies `CAP_NET_RAW` before frame I/O and the
//! host verifies `CAP_DRV_LOAD` at load (see `lib/abi/src/driver/net.rs`
//! and the driver-shell crate).
//!
//! # Frame rings
//!
//! Frame I/O is [`Net::service`] over the shared-memory frame-ring
//! transport (`plans/NETWORK.md` §2.3): every call reaps completed
//! transmissions, drains the TX ring into the device, and harvests
//! delivered frames into the RX ring. The doorbell **never waits**:
//! it moves what is ready and returns, so it is safe to serve across
//! a process boundary (the driver process answering the stack's
//! `Service` request), where parking would block the reply and the
//! serve loop. Waiting for the next device event is the caller's job
//! — the driver parks on the device interrupt and rings the stack's
//! notify port. Each `service` reaps completed transmissions and then
//! drains **every** queued frame the device can still hold into the
//! transmit ring — up to the ring's descriptor capacity, kept in flight
//! at once — so a burst (a TCP data segment and the ACK queued right
//! behind it) egresses together in one call rather than one frame per
//! call. A call consumes at most a ring's worth of completions from each
//! queue, however fast the device posts them, and leaves the rest for the
//! next. Back-pressure applies only when the transmit ring is genuinely
//! full: the remaining queued frames are left in the frame ring for the
//! next completion-driven call — never waited on, never dropped. A frame
//! in flight has its completion reaped non-blockingly on a later call
//! (the shared device interrupt the completion raises drives it). A
//! reassembled receive frame that finds the RX ring full is likewise
//! held (its buffers stay consumed, not re-posted) and delivered by the
//! next call, before any further completion is harvested.
//!
//! # Staging buffers
//!
//! DMA staging is allocated **once**, at [`VirtioNet::open`]: a fixed
//! pool of single-descriptor receive buffers plus one reassembly buffer
//! on the receive side, and a fixed pool of header + frame-buffer pairs
//! (one per concurrently in-flight transmission, sized to the transmit
//! ring) on the send side — all reused for every packet. Every receive
//! buffer is posted as a device-write descriptor at open and re-posted
//! after its frame is delivered, so the device always owns a pool of
//! receive buffers and an idle `service` poll touches no allocator — no
//! per-packet `dma_alloc`/`dma_free` round trip, no per-poll audit-log
//! traffic on the hot path. The single-buffer common path delivers
//! straight from its source buffer, so it copies once (into the RX
//! ring); only a merged multi-buffer frame is assembled through the
//! reassembly buffer.
//!
//! # Zero-on-free
//!
//! [`Net::service`] honours a
//! [`BufferClass::Sensitive`](tairix_abi::driver::BufferClass) ring
//! class by scrubbing the persistent transmit staging through
//! [`tairix_virtio::BounceBuffer::into_slab`] before the buffers are
//! reused for the next packet, and by zeroing each receive buffer (and
//! the reassembly buffer) after its frame is delivered, before it is
//! re-posted to the device — never before delivery. A frame no call
//! delivered has no class, so dropping the engine zeroes the whole receive
//! pool and reassembly buffer once the device's reset confirms.
