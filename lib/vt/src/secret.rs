//! The secret-entry **activity indicator**: the `[input active...]` marker a
//! terminal shows while a password is being typed with echo suppressed.
//!
//! A suppressed (no-echo) secret read renders nothing at all, so the operator
//! gets no feedback that keystrokes are landing. This module is the one
//! definition of the visual feedback every text/terminal password prompt
//! shows instead: after the first typed character the prompt gains
//! `[input active.]`, whose trailing dots cycle `.` → `..` → `...` on a
//! one-second cadence. The animation is **bounded**: it runs for at least
//! [`SECRET_ANIMATE_NS`] after the most recent keystroke and then freezes
//! (the marker stays on screen, showing that input is still open, but the
//! dots stop moving and no further timer wake-ups are taken). A later
//! keystroke restarts the bounded animation. When the line is submitted
//! (Enter) the marker is replaced in place with `[input complete]`; when the
//! line is erased back to empty the marker is removed entirely, and an
//! aborted read clears it with [`SecretIndicator::abort`]. One indicator can
//! be reused across several prompt lines (a wrong passphrase asked again):
//! after a line completes, the next keystroke begins a fresh marker at the
//! new prompt's cursor rather than disturbing the completed one.
//!
//! [`SecretIndicator`] is the pure state machine: it performs no I/O and
//! reads no clock — the caller feeds it input events and tick wake-ups with
//! the current monotonic time and writes the returned [`Render`] bytes to the
//! terminal. A consumer that repaints its whole field instead — a curses view,
//! a desktop password field — drives it the same way and draws
//! [`SecretIndicator::marker`], so the text and its cadence have one
//! definition however they reach the screen. Timing is **one-shot**: [`SecretIndicator::deadline_ns`] names
//! the single next animation frame while the animation is running, or `None`
//! while the marker is hidden, frozen, or complete — the caller arms exactly
//! that deadline and nothing else, so a prompt with nothing typed yet takes no
//! timer wake-ups at all, and the animation's wake-ups span only the bounded
//! window from a keystroke to [`SECRET_ANIMATE_NS`] after the last one.
//!
//! The rendering is plain printable text plus backspace/space rub-out — no
//! escape sequences — so it draws correctly on every console backing (UART,
//! framebuffer text console, or a remote terminal). Nothing about the secret
//! itself is ever rendered: the marker is the same fixed text regardless of
//! what, or how much, was typed.
