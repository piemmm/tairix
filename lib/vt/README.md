# `tairix-vt`

The canonical ANSI / VT / xterm escape and attribute **vocabulary** for
TAIRiX's text stack. It is the single source of truth (`AGENTS.md` §2.2) for:

- the C0 / C1 control set and the CSI / OSC / DCS introducers,
- the SGR attribute set (bold, dim, italic, underline, blink, reverse,
  strike) and the three colour models — the 16 ANSI colours, the 256-colour
  palette (`38;5;n`), and 24-bit truecolour (`38;2;r;g;b`),
- cursor movement and absolute positioning, erase-in-line / erase-in-display,
  the scroll region, alt-screen enter/leave, cursor show/hide, and
  save/restore,
- a shared [`Cell`] / [`Attributes`] representation reused by both the
  *consumer* (the terminal emulator's `Grid`) and the *emitter* (the curses
  renderer),
- the standard semantic colour **scheme** (`scheme::Role` / `scheme::Style`):
  the one role-to-SGR palette (heading, directory, executable, link, error, …) every
  colour-capable tool names roles from instead of raw colour numbers, so the
  scheme evolves as data. It holds the ideal colours only; degrading them to a
  terminal's depth is `lib/curses`'s one `downgrade` (truecolour → 256 → 16 →
  mono),
- the character display-width vocabulary (`width::char_width` / `is_wide` /
  `str_width` / `truncate_to_width` and the wide-glyph `CONTINUATION` cell
  marker): the one East-Asian-Wide/fullwidth/emoji table every cell grid
  (`lib/curses`, `lib/fbcon`, the terminal emulator) measures through, so
  they all agree where a glyph ends,
- the read line discipline's **buffer** half (`line::LineEditor`): CR or LF
  completes a line, an erase — the single-byte Backspace/Delete controls or
  the Delete key's `CSI 3 ~` sequence (`line::EraseSeq`, held across split
  reads) — rubs out the last kept byte (zeroing its slot), and an over-long
  line fails closed. It is the one editor every console reader runs (the
  boot passphrase prompt, login's prompt reads, the shell REPL), matching
  the kernel console's echo half byte for byte,
- the secret-entry activity indicator (`secret::SecretIndicator`): the
  `[input active...]` marker every echo-suppressed (password) prompt shows,
  its dots cycling on a one-second cadence for at least three seconds after
  the most recent keystroke and then freezing (a later keystroke restarts
  it), replaced in place with `[input complete]` on Enter, with one-shot
  deadline timing — a pure state machine its hosts render: the kernel
  console and login's prompt as text with rub-outs, and `lib/controls`'
  masked entry as the whole marker it names (`marker`, `submit`),
- the shape of the conventional character-cell screen
  (`CONVENTIONAL_COLUMNS` × `CONVENTIONAL_ROWS`, 80×25): the floor the
  framebuffer text console keeps when it sizes its grid to the discovered
  panel, and the grid a terminal window opens at, defined once so the two
  cannot disagree about what a normal screen is,
- the shared screen-semantics conformance script (`conformance::check`): the
  one specification of how a character-cell grid applies the `Op` stream —
  pending wrap, erase, scroll region, alternate screen, save/restore — that
  every consumer (the framebuffer boot console's `lib/fbcon`, the desktop
  terminal emulator) implements `conformance::ScreenModel` over and runs in
  its own tests, so a change to one screen's semantics fails the other's test
  too.

It ships **both** an emitter (`Op` → bytes) and a streaming parser (bytes →
`Op` events) built over the *same* tables, so the two provably agree: every
operation the emitter writes parses back to the identical operation.

`no_std`, with an **optional default-on `alloc` feature**. The parser and its
`Op` / `Cell` / `Attributes` vocabulary are **allocation-free** regardless: the
`Parser` uses fixed inline buffers bounded by `MAX_PARAMS` / `MAX_STRING`, so it
holds no heap. The `alloc` feature (on by default) adds the two views that need
a heap — the byte **emitter** (`encode` / `encode_all` / `encode_into` and
`Sgr::write_params`) and the OSC window-title operation (`Op::SetTitle`, which
owns a `String`). A consumer with no global allocator — the aarch64 framebuffer
boot console — depends on the crate with `default-features = false` and takes
just the parser; every emitter-side consumer (the curses renderer, `termcap`,
`man`, the terminal app) keeps the default features and is unchanged. The split
mirrors `lib/font`'s atlas-only `render` feature. The parser is total: any byte
stream is consumed without panic or out-of-bounds access (`AGENTS.md` §2.9); an
unrecognised or oversized sequence is dropped safely. No `unwrap` / `expect` /
`panic!`, and nothing ever touches fd 3 (`stdinfo`, §20).

## Layering

`lib/vt` depends on `lib/*` only — never on `kernel/*`, `drivers/*`, or
`userland/*` (`AGENTS.md` §17.4). It is text-only infrastructure and lives
outside `userland/gui/*`, so a headless image links it freely (§17.3).

## Stability

**experimental.** The vocabulary is being grown stage by stage under
`plans/CURSES.md`; the public surface may still change until the curses stack
(C4/C5) pins its requirements.
