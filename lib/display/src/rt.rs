//! The production, `tairix-rt`-backed [`ShmMapper`] (feature `rt`).
//!
//! The one definition of "map a client's granted shared-memory region
//! through the kernel's `shm_map`, sized from the kernel's own record of
//! the region length — never the granting client's claim" — shared by
//! the framebuffer display service's serve loop and the desktop
//! session's window server (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3), so the mapping
//! discipline cannot drift between the two.
//!
//! The mapping itself is the runtime's [`MappedGrant`]; this narrows it to
//! the read-only view a frame region is, so nothing reached through a
//! [`FrameRegion`] can write into a client's frames.
