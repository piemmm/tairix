//! Turning an application's pixels into the bytes a **window** frame holds,
//! and back.
//!
//! A window channel carries an app's pixels in one `shm`-granted frame laid out
//! by a [`DisplayMode`], exactly as the display service's scan-out frame is —
//! but with one difference that matters: the screen is opaque, so
//! [`ChannelOrder::encode`] writes a premultiplied channel unchanged, whereas a
//! window frame carries the app's own alpha and therefore holds **straight**
//! alpha. Both directions of that conversion live here, once, over the same
//! [`ChannelOrder`] the scan-out path resolves, so nothing anywhere holds a
//! second opinion about which byte is red.
//!
//! * [`encode`] — the app's side: a [`Surface`] of premultiplied pixels out
//!   into the frame it granted the session.
//! * [`decode`] — the desktop's side: a presented frame in to the compositor's
//!   own window surface, reporting the sub-rectangle whose pixels the
//!   conversion actually *changed*.
//!
//! # Why only one side is given a real [`JobRunner`]
//!
//! Both directions are row-independent by construction — a row reads and writes
//! only its own pixels — so both are expressed over a runner. In practice the
//! desktop passes a real pool and an app passes [`tairix_parallel::SERIAL`], and
//! the asymmetry is principled rather than an oversight: an app decides how much
//! it presents and should present only what it changed, while the session must
//! accept whatever damage the app declares and cannot make it smaller.
//! Spreading the pass it cannot bound is what keeps one app's whole-window
//! repaint off the desktop's critical path.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! Every index either direction will use is validated **before** the first
//! write, so a malformed or hostile geometry refuses the whole conversion
//! rather than leaving half a window converted. A format with no channel order
//! here is refused, never guessed: guessing renders the window in false colour.
//!
//! A conversion covers the surface's full extent; an active clip
//! ([`Surface::with_clip`]) narrows which pixels it reaches, which is the
//! caller's own choice rather than something this module second-guesses.
