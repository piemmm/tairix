//! The server half: the engine a display driver's `Run` binary hosts.
//!
//! [`DisplayServer::serve`] handles exactly one received request:
//! decode → live-lease check → validation → action → encoded reply. The
//! hosting binary owns the transport (bind the reserved
//! `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`, park on its wait-set, `call_recv` /
//! `call_reply`); the engine owns every decision in between, so the
//! semantics are host-testable against mock seams and identical under
//! any host.
//!
//! # Security shape
//!
//! * **Identity is kernel-attested.** The engine never reads a claimed
//!   lease: [`PeerFacts::live_generation`] asks the kernel whether the
//!   *in-flight caller of this endpoint* holds the seat's live lease
//!   (`call_peer_seat`), and every request that acts for a seat — `Query`
//!   included — is gated on it before any state is read or mutated.
//! * **The device read carries its own authority.** `QueryStats` acts for no
//!   seat, so a lease is the wrong question about it: it is gated on the
//!   caller's kernel-attested `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`
//!   ([`PeerFacts::holds_capability`]) instead. A monitor holds no lease and
//!   never will, and hardware utilisation is what that capability governs
//!   everywhere else in the system.
//! * **The occupancy the read serves is measured, not claimed.** `busy_ns`
//!   accumulates only around the driver's own present call, and the window it
//!   is a share of opens at that same instant — so a refused present (a stale
//!   lease, a bad frame index, a rectangle outside the mode) adds nothing
//!   because the device was never driven, and no request an unauthorised
//!   caller can send moves any of it.
//! * **Frames are bound to the lease that configured them.** `Configure`
//!   records the granting lease's generation; a `Present` whose caller
//!   holds any *other* generation (the seat was revoked and re-acquired)
//!   is refused `NotFound` until the new owner reconfigures — one owner's
//!   frames can never scan out under another's lease.
//! * **A configuration ends with its lease, and only then.** The hosting
//!   binary hands the engine the kernel's own announcement of the boot
//!   seat's lease ([`DisplayServer::lease_moved`]), and a configuration
//!   whose lease has ended is released there. A refused request changes
//!   nothing: the endpoint takes calls from anyone, and a refusal cannot
//!   tell the owner that lost its lease from a stranger that never held
//!   it, so letting one release the configuration would let any process
//!   take the desktop's screen away.
//! * **A switched-off display never outlives the configuration that asked
//!   for it.** Releasing or replacing a configuration switches the display
//!   back on first, so a crashed or departed presenter cannot leave the
//!   next owner of the seat — the text console included — with a dark
//!   screen.
//! * **Every bound is checked before any pixel access.** The configured
//!   geometry must equal the active mode exactly, the mapped region must
//!   hold every frame, the frame index must name a configured frame, and
//!   *every* damage rectangle must lie inside the mode — the whole list is
//!   checked before the first is blitted, so one bad rectangle refuses the
//!   present rather than half-applying it. Each failure is a typed
//!   refusal, never a clamp.
