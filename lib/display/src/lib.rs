//! The display-service protocol engine (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D7b).
//!
//! One crate hosts **both halves** of the `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` protocol
//! over injected seams, so the semantics — what a request means, what is
//! validated, what is refused — have exactly one definition:
//!
//! * [`server::DisplayServer`] — the engine a display driver's `Run`
//!   binary hosts: decode → caller-authority check ([`server::PeerFacts`]) →
//!   geometry/bounds validation → blit through the
//!   [`Display`](tairix_abi::driver::display::Display) trait.
//! * [`client::DisplayClient`] / [`client::RemoteDisplay`] — the
//!   session-side half over a [`client::DisplayTransport`]:
//!   `RemoteDisplay` implements the existing `Display` trait over the
//!   client's mapping of the shared frame region, so a compositor
//!   presents through it unchanged.
//!
//! The wire format itself lives in `tairix_abi::display_ipc`; this crate
//! adds the behaviour. Frames travel through one `shm_grant`ed region
//! mapped once at configure time — presents carry a frame index and a
//! damage rectangle, never pixels.
//!
//! Behind the `service` feature, the `service` module is the one bring-up
//! and serve loop every display driver's service binary runs, parked on the
//! endpoint and on the kernel's announcement of the boot seat's lease.
//!
//! The crate also hosts [`framebuffer::Framebuffer`] — the generic
//! linear-surface engine the framebuffer service's `Run` binary scans
//! out through (and the framebuffer QEMU verticals drive directly), so
//! the surface blit has exactly one definition — [`winframe`], the
//! pixel/byte boundary of a **window** frame, which is the same
//! channel-order decision as the scan-out path's and therefore has to be
//! defined beside it rather than re-derived by every app — and
//! [`sleep::DisplaySleep`], how a presenter switches its display off for
//! energy and wakes it again.
