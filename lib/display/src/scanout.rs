//! Turning composited pixels into the bytes a scan-out frame holds.
//!
//! Every program that presents through [`crate::RemoteDisplay`] faces the
//! same three questions: how big is the frame for this mode, which byte
//! order does this format want, and is this damage rectangle a sub-region
//! or the whole screen. The answers are pixel-exact — a wrong channel order
//! renders the display in false colour, and a damage rectangle that lies
//! shows stale pixels — so there is one definition of each here, shared by
//! the compositing window manager and the graphical login screen rather
//! than copied into both.
//!
//! What is *not* here is the composition itself. A compositor blending many
//! windows through a back buffer and a program blitting one surface are
//! genuinely different loops; both encode their result through
//! [`ChannelOrder::encode`] — a whole run of it through
//! [`ChannelOrder::encode_run`], which is that same encoder in bulk — and
//! neither pretends to be the other.
//!
//! The three per-pixel codecs are `#[inline]`: each is reached once per pixel
//! from another module or crate — the window-frame codec's rows, the
//! compositor's reveal encode — and the desktop's crates are built with many
//! codegen units and no link-time optimisation in the profile the debug image
//! uses, so without it a four-byte shuffle costs an out-of-line call.
