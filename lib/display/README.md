# tairix-display

Stability tier: **experimental**.

The display-service protocol engine (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D7b): the one
definition of the zero-copy, lease-gated frame-presentation semantics
shared by both ends of the `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` rendezvous, so the server
and the client can never drift apart.

- **Server** (`DisplayServer`): the engine a display driver's `Run`
  binary hosts. It decodes each fixed-width `DisplayRequest`, gates each
  request that acts for a seat — `Query` included — on the caller's **live
  seat lease** through the injected `PeerFacts` seam (the kernel's
  `call_peer_seat`, an oracle-free fact about the in-flight caller), and
  gates the seatless `QueryStats` device read on that same seam's
  capability question (`CAP_SYSINFO_HW`, since a monitor holds no lease).
  It maps the client's
  endpoint-directed `shm_grant` region **once** at `Configure` through
  the injected `ShmMapper` seam, and scans out on `Present` by frame
  index through the `Display` trait — damage-aware via
  `Display::present_rects`, whose whole rectangle list it validates before
  blitting any of it, with no per-present mapping, allocation, or copy of
  its own. A `Configure` binds the mapped frames to the granting
  lease's generation; a `Present` under any other lease (a revoked or
  re-acquired seat) is refused fail-closed until the new owner
  reconfigures, so one owner's frames can never be scanned out under
  another's lease. A refused request leaves the configuration exactly
  as it was: only the kernel's lease notice (`lease_moved`) or a newer
  owner's `Configure` releases it, so no caller can unconfigure the
  display by sending something malformed.
- **Power** (`SetPower`): the lease holder switches its display on or
  off through `Display::set_power`. A power-down never outlives the
  configuration that asked for it: the release that follows a lease's
  end switches the display back on, and a service that starts knows
  nothing of the display's state, so its first configuration lights it.
- **Sleep** (`DisplaySleep` / `SwitchedOff`): how a presenter puts the
  display it owns to sleep and wakes it — switched off where it can be,
  kept black by its presenter where it has no power control or refuses,
  and switched back on only if it was switched off, with a refusal to
  light leaving it asleep for the next wake to ask again. The desktop's
  screensaver and the login screen both sleep their display through it,
  so which refusal means what has one definition.
- **Surface engine** (`Framebuffer` / `FramebufferConfig`): the generic
  linear-framebuffer scan-out engine the framebuffer service's `Run`
  binary hosts behind the `Display` trait (and the framebuffer QEMU
  verticals drive directly), hoisted here so the surface blit has
  exactly one definition. It validates the discovered geometry
  fail-closed, maps exactly `stride_bytes * height_px` bytes through
  the capability-gated `MmioMapper`, and blits full frames or damage
  spans with every write bounds-checked by the window.
- **Scan-out encode** (`scanout`): the pixel-exact decisions both
  presenting programs — the compositing window manager and the graphical
  login screen — have to get right, so neither carries its own copy: how
  many bytes a frame is for a mode (`scanout_len`), which byte order the
  mode's format wants (`ChannelOrder::for_format`), the channel encode
  itself (`ChannelOrder::encode`, and `encode_run` for a whole row span
  at a time — the bulk form of that same encoder, not a second one), and
  whether a damage rectangle is a sub-region or the whole frame
  (`sub_screen_damage`). Each refuses rather than guesses: an
  unencodable mode or format is `None`, and a run writes whole pixels
  only, stopping at whichever of its two slices ends first and reporting
  the count the caller checks. The three per-pixel codecs are `#[inline]`,
  and load-bearingly so: each is reached once per pixel from another module
  or crate, and the desktop's crates build with many codegen units and no
  link-time optimisation in the profile the debug image uses, so without it
  a four-byte shuffle costs an out-of-line call.
- **Window-frame codec** (`winframe`): the same pixel/byte boundary for the
  frame a *window* channel carries, in both directions — `encode` writes an
  app's premultiplied surface out as the straight-alpha bytes the frame holds,
  and `decode` reads a presented frame into the compositor's own window surface
  and reports the sub-rectangle whose pixels genuinely changed. It lives beside
  the scan-out encode because the channel-order decision is the same one, and no
  program may hold a second opinion about which byte is red. Both directions are
  row-independent and are expressed over `lib/parallel`'s `JobRunner`: the
  desktop hands the decode a real pool because it cannot bound a pass whose size
  the app declares, and an app encodes on its own thread because it *can* — it
  should present only what it changed. Every index is validated before the first
  write, so a hostile geometry refuses the whole conversion rather than leaving a
  window half-converted.
- **Service loop** (`service`, feature `service`): the one bring-up and
  serve loop every display driver's `Run` binary hosts — the reserved
  endpoint bind, one wait-set holding it and the kernel's display-lease
  notice, the kernel-attested caller facts, the reserved exit codes and the
  one-shot `FIRST_PRESENT` record — so a driver's `main` is its surface and
  nothing else. The feature pulls in the userland runtime, so the host
  build of the engine stays free of it.
- **Client** (`DisplayClient` / `RemoteDisplay`): the session-side half
  over the injected `DisplayTransport` seam. `RemoteDisplay` implements
  the existing `tairix_abi` `Display` trait over the client's own
  mapping of the shared frame region, so `Compositor::present` is
  unchanged: a present copies only the changed pixels (the damage
  unioned with the target frame's stale region — the double-buffer
  bookkeeping that keeps every frame current) into the back frame and
  sends the index + damage, never the pixels.

Every input is validated fail-closed on both halves; the error
vocabulary crosses the wire as typed `Errno` status frames, converted
through the one shared `DriverError::as_errno` mapping on the server
and the client-side inverse `driver_error_from_errno` here.

`no_std`, `forbid(unsafe_code)`; unit-tested on the host against mock
seams (the protocol halves in `src/tests.rs`; the surface engine in
`tests/framebuffer.rs`, a separate test crate because its mock
`RegisterWindow` needs the `unsafe` constructor the library itself
forbids). Consumed by the framebuffer and Raspberry Pi display services'
`Run` binaries (service loop + surface engine), the framebuffer QEMU
verticals (surface engine), and the desktop session (client).
