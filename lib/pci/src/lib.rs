//! TAIRiX PCI/PCIe configuration-access mechanism library.
//!
//! A `no_std` `lib/*` crate: it implements the
//! `abi-v1` PCI/PCIe bus and transport seams
//! ([`tairix_abi::driver::bus::Bus`], [`VirtioPciBus`], [`MsixBus`],
//! [`PciBus`]) over three configuration-access mechanisms, and exposes them
//! through the [`mechanism_one`] / [`mechanism_ecam`] / [`mechanism_brcm`]
//! constructors. The concrete `Pci<C>` type stays crate-private — every
//! caller borrows the result as `&dyn Bus` / `&dyn VirtioPciBus` /
//! `&dyn MsixBus` / `&dyn PciBus` and never names it.
//!
//! It lives in `lib/` (not `drivers/`) because PCI configuration access is
//! shared *bus-protocol* logic, not a single device's driver: the kernel's
//! ring-0 boot pipeline, a user-space bus driver (`drivers/bus/pcie_brcm`),
//! and the host-side integration tests all compose it through the public
//! seams above — a `drivers/*` crate may not depend on another `drivers/*`
//! crate, so a user-space driver reaches the mechanism
//! here, never through a sibling driver. This mirrors the `lib/usb` ↔
//! `drivers/bus/usb` and `lib/virtio` ↔ `drivers/bus/virtio` split.
//!
//! The three mechanisms are: x86_64 **mechanism #1** (PCI Local Bus 3.0
//! §3.2.2.3.2 — the `0xCF8`/`0xCFC` address/data port pair), **ECAM**
//! (PCI Express Base 3.0 §7.2.2 — flat MMIO configuration space), and the
//! **BCM2711 windowed** mechanism (the Raspberry Pi 4 root complex's
//! index/data window pair). MSI / MSI-X capabilities are *discovered* and
//! routed through [`MsixBus::route_msix`]; the BAR walker maps a BAR only
//! through the supplied [`MmioMapper`], which enforces
//! [`CapabilityId::MMIO_MAP`](tairix_abi::CapabilityId::MMIO_MAP) kernel-side
//! (no ambient authority).
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This crate contains no `unsafe`: the `in`/`out` instructions that reach
//! I/O ports `0xCF8`/`0xCFC` live in the architecture port behind the
//! [`tairix_abi::PortIo`] seam, driven only through
//! `mech_one::PortIoConfigSpace`, which the unit tests exercise against a
//! recording mock.

// --- Real-hardware construction seam --------------------------------------

/// Construct a real-hardware PCI root bus over configuration
/// **mechanism #1** (PCI Local Bus 3.0 §3.2.2.3.2): the address word
/// at I/O port `0xCF8` selects a `(bus, device, function, register)`
/// tuple and the data word at `0xCFC` reads/writes the corresponding
/// configuration dword. The `pio` backend issues the port accesses
/// (the x86_64 architecture port supplies [`tairix_abi::PortIo`]).
///
/// The returned value is the bus the ring-0 boot pipeline drives
/// through the three frozen `abi-v1` seams — [`Bus`] (enumeration),
/// [`VirtioPciBus`] (virtio register-window provisioning), and
/// [`MsixBus`] (MSI-X interrupt routing). [`VirtioPciBus`] and
/// [`MsixBus`] both have [`Bus`] as a supertrait, so the return bound
/// names only the two leaf seams; the opaque type still implements
/// [`Bus`] and coerces to `&dyn Bus`. The concrete `Pci` type stays
/// crate-private: callers borrow the result as
/// `&dyn Bus` / `&dyn VirtioPciBus` / `&dyn MsixBus` and never name it.
///
/// Construction performs **no** I/O — it only stores the supplied
/// port-I/O backend — so it is sound to call before the PCI host
/// bridge has been probed. Configuration access happens lazily on the
/// trait methods, each of which drives the [`PortIo`] backend against
/// the two legacy configuration ports.
///
/// Every access is an address write to one port followed by a data access
/// to the other, and the pair is one machine-wide resource: two accesses
/// interleaved from different CPUs reach the wrong register. The caller
/// serialises every user of the machine's ports, as the x86_64 port's one
/// configuration-space owner does.
///
/// # Platform
///
/// Mechanism #1 is x86-only, but that architecture knowledge lives
/// entirely in the [`PortIo`] backend the caller supplies — the
/// architecture port (`kernel/arch/x86_64`) provides the only
/// real implementation. This constructor is therefore
/// architecture-neutral and carries no target-conditional `cfg` gate; architectures without an I/O port
/// space simply never call it and reach `PCIe` through memory-mapped
/// ECAM, a separate seam.
