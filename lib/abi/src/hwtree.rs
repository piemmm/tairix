//! The architecture-neutral hardware tree.
//!
//! TAIRiX detects the hardware actually present at boot and autoloads the
//! matching drivers; it does not ship a hand-maintained static device list. The *single* inventory contract is the **hardware
//! tree** defined here: each architecture port normalises its platform's
//! native source (ACPI on x86_64, a flattened device tree on aarch64 /
//! riscv64, a host-capability query on wasm32) into a flat list of
//! [`HwNode`]s linked by parent id, and the user-space device manager
//! (`userland/system/devmgr`) matches each node's [`HwMatchKey`]s against
//! the bind table every driver declares in its signed manifest.
//!
//! # ABI discipline
//!
//! The hardware tree is held to the same discipline as the syscall table and the System Information API: it is
//! versioned ([`HWTREE_VERSION_V1`]), every record has a fixed wire layout
//! pinned by a `WIRE_LEN` constant and a frozen-layout host test, and the
//! C view is generated from this source of truth (`cargo xtask c-header`).
//! Extend the tree with a new version; never mutate a shipped one.
//!
//! # No ambient authority
//!
//! A node's resources (MMIO windows, IRQ lines, port ranges, DMA needs)
//! are expressed as capability-grant **requests** ([`HwResource`]), never
//! as raw ambient handles: a matched driver receives only
//! the resource capabilities its node requested, and no more. The
//! capability a resource needs is named explicitly as a [`CapabilityId`].
//!
//! The types are `#[repr(C)]`, `no_std`, and allocation-free: a node is a
//! fixed-size record built on the boot stack, encoded little-endian through
//! the shared `le` helpers, and decoded with every field bounds-checked
//! against `WIRE_LEN` (validate every input, fail
//! closed).
