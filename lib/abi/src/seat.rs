//! The seat-manager service ABI (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D3): the reserved
//! `seatmgr` rendezvous and the typed seat-administration request it serves.
//!
//! The seat manager (`userland/system/seatmgr`) is the sole holder of
//! `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` — the seat-multiplexing authority. It binds the
//! reserved [`SEATMGR_ENDPOINT`] (squat-protected by
//! [`crate::ipc::is_reserved_endpoint`]) and serves the two administrative
//! operations over the kernel's `seat_switch` / `seat_revoke` syscalls,
//! gating every request on the *requester's* kernel-attested
//! `CAP_SEAT_ADMIN` — the same broker discipline `sysinfod` applies to its
//! privileged queries, so administrative seat policy flows through one
//! audited service rather than ad-hoc syscall callers.
//!
//! Requests are the fixed-width [`SeatAdminRequest`]; the reply is the
//! shared [`SEATMGR_REPLY_LEN`]-byte status frame
//! ([`crate::reply::encode_status_reply`] /
//! [`crate::reply::decode_status_reply`]) carrying `0` or a negative
//! [`Errno`] discriminant. Every decode fails closed: an unknown magic,
//! version, operation, or a dirty reserved field refuses rather than
//! guessing.
