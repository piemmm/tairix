//! 64-bit-native time types for the TAIRiX ABI.
//!
//! TAIRiX is 64-bit-time-native: no kernel ABI, userland ABI, IPC type, log
//! format, native filesystem, or persistent OS metadata may store absolute
//! time as 32-bit seconds. The two canonical types live here:
//!
//! - [`Time64`] — an absolute instant, signed 64-bit seconds since the Unix
//!   epoch plus a nanosecond field. It is TAIRiX's equivalent of Linux's
//!   `timespec64` (seconds *and* nanoseconds), not a seconds-only
//!   `time64_t`.
//! - [`Duration64`] — a span of time, signed 64-bit seconds plus a
//!   nanosecond field.
//!
//! Both store the sub-second component as a canonical nanosecond count in
//! `0..NANOS_PER_SEC`, so the derived ordering is chronological and the wire
//! encoding is unambiguous. Conversions to narrower representations (for
//! example a legacy on-disk timestamp) are **checked**: an unrepresentable
//! value fails with [`Errno::TimestampOutOfRange`] rather than silently
//! truncating, wrapping, saturating, or guessing a timezone.
//!
//! Like the rest of this crate, the types are `no_std`, allocation-free, and
//! encode/decode through borrowed byte slices so the same code runs in the
//! kernel, a freestanding driver, and a WebAssembly userland binary.
