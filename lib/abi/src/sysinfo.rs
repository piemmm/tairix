//! System Information API (`sysinfo`) — the ABI surface.
//!
//! TAIRiX has no `/proc` and no `/sys`. Every piece of live system
//! information that would have lived under those trees is exposed through
//! this single, versioned, capability-checked API. Each query is a *typed*
//! request returning a *typed* response — there is no free-form text
//! scraping interface — and every query declares the capability a caller
//! must hold to invoke it.
//!
//! Adding a query carries the same discipline as adding a syscall: the registry is versioned, its canonical encoding is
//! hashed, and it is frozen on release. Existing [`SysinfoQueryId`] numbers
//! and [`SysinfoQuerySpec`] rows must never be re-numbered or removed; new
//! queries take the next free identifier and ship in `sysinfo-v2`.
//!
//! This module defines only the wire types and the frozen registry. The
//! user-space service that answers the queries lives at
//! `/System/Services/sysinfod.app/Run` (`userland/system/sysinfod`); the kernel has
//! no privileged path that bypasses the capability check.
