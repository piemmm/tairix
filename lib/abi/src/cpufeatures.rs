//! Arch-neutral CPU-feature vocabulary shared across the workspace.
//!
//! Every TAIRiX image is compiled against a conservative *build-time floor*
//! — the common instruction set of every machine that image must boot
//! (`plans/FIX-HARDWARE-FEATURES.md` P0). Anything the booted CPU offers
//! *above* that floor — CRC32, the aarch64 crypto extension, wide SIMD,
//! hardware AES — is reachable only by asking the silicon at runtime which
//! extensions it actually implements, then dispatching to an
//! extension-using routine only on cores that have it.
//!
//! That runtime answer is a deterministic fact ([`CpuFeatureSet`]) read from
//! CPU-ID registers by the architecture ports, and it is consumed by the
//! generic `lib/cpuops` dispatch framework to pick the fastest *correct*,
//! feature-legal implementation of each accelerated operation. Both the
//! architecture HAL (which produces the set) and `lib/cpuops` (which consumes
//! it) need the *same* definition of "which extension", so — exactly like the
//! hardware tree in [`crate::hwtree`] — that definition lives here in the one
//! dependency-free ABI crate both layers already depend on, rather than in
//! either of them (a `lib/*` crate may not depend on `kernel/*`, and two
//! private copies of the vocabulary would drift).
//!
//! The vocabulary is *capability* only: it answers "does this core have the
//! instruction?", never "which routine is fastest?". Benchmarking to discover
//! whether an instruction exists would be a defect — an absent instruction
//! traps, so the capability gate must be exact and read from ID registers.

/// A single detectable CPU instruction-set extension.
///
/// The enum is closed and cross-architecture: each variant is one extension a
/// consumer gates on, and its discriminant is its stable bit index in a
/// [`CpuFeatureSet`]. A variant is only ever set by the port whose ISA defines
/// it, so a `CpuFeatureSet` produced on aarch64 never has an x86_64-only bit
/// set and vice versa.
///
/// New extensions are appended (never renumbered): the discriminant is a wire
/// position a [`CpuFeatureSet`]'s bits and the pin/log records depend on.
