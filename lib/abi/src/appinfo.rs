//! Application-bundle (`.app`) manifest and loader policy — the ABI surface.
//!
//! An installed application is a `/Apps/<Name>.app/` directory with a
//! **fixed** top-level layout: a signed `AppInfo`
//! manifest, a `Run` entry-point binary, and a closed set of optional
//! sub-directories. This module owns three frozen pieces of that contract:
//!
//! * [`BundleEntry`] + [`validate_bundle_layout`] — the exact set of names a
//!   bundle may contain at its top level, and the rule that `AppInfo` and
//!   `Run` are mandatory. Anything else is a packaging defect the loader
//!   refuses.
//! * [`AppInfoHeader`] — the fixed-size, signed manifest prefix: bundle
//!   identity (id / name / version), the target ABI version and syscall
//!   table hash, the count of requested capabilities and declared MIME
//!   types, the bundle's program-library listing ([`LibraryCategory`] +
//!   optional icon asset — how the desktop's launcher discovers which
//!   folder a graphical application files under), a hash binding the
//!   signature to the bundle's contents, the Ed25519 signer key +
//!   signature, and the publisher key + delegation certificate that give
//!   the bundle a developer identity ([`PublisherId`]) its per-build
//!   signing key may rotate under. The variable body that follows is a
//!   capability-id list
//!   (decoded by [`crate::decode_capability_ids`]) followed by the
//!   MIME-type table ([`mime_type_at`]).
//! * [`resolve_library`] — the dynamic-loader policy: a shared-library
//!   reference resolves only against the requesting bundle's own
//!   `Libraries/` directory or the curated [`SYSTEM_LIBRARIES_DIR`]; any
//!   other path is a load-time error.
//!
//! The module is `no_std`, allocation-free, and operates on borrowed byte
//! slices, so the same code runs in the kernel, in a user-space loader
//! service, and in a WebAssembly userland binary unchanged. Like every
//! `lib/abi` surface it is frozen on release: existing
//! fields, offsets, and [`BundleEntry`] names never change; new behaviour
//! ships in `abi-v2`.
