//! The field bounds of one account record, shared by every layer that
//! stores, carries, or renders one.
//!
//! The `users-v1` / `groups-v1` databases enforce these bounds on what
//! may be stored; the fixed-width [`sysinfo`](crate::sysinfo) directory
//! and account frames size their inline buffers from the same figures.
//! They are equal by definition — a record the database accepts must fit
//! the frame that reports it — so they are defined here once and imported
//! (`tairix_users` re-exports them), never restated per layer.
//!
//! These are **validation bounds, not capacities**: they exist so a
//! hostile or corrupt database line cannot force an unbounded name, path,
//! or group set through a decoder. Raising one is a reviewed change to
//! this file, never a per-call workaround.
