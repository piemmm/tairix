//! The desktop a window is displayed on, as its session reports it: the
//! screen extent, the UI scale, the four axes of how its theme is drawn —
//! light or dark, contrast, density, and motion — and the one double-click
//! interval every surface pairs presses under.
//!
//! These are the facts an application needs before it can lay itself out
//! honestly — how large the screen it will be shown on is, how many
//! physical pixels a logical one is worth, and how the user has asked the
//! desktop to be drawn. All of them belong to the seat's desktop, all are
//! known to the session that composites it, and none describes another
//! principal's data or authorises an action: they are descriptive,
//! seat-scoped, and delivered over the window channel the application
//! already holds ([`crate::window_ipc`]), so learning them needs no
//! capability and opens no new endpoint.
//!
//! The accessibility axes travel with the appearance rather than beside
//! it because they are one decision to a reader and one repaint to an
//! application: a user who turns contrast up has not changed the screen,
//! and an application that learned only half of what changed would draw
//! the other half the way the user just stopped asking for.
//!
//! The record travels in two places, from one definition: an application
//! *asks* for it with `QueryDesktop` — before it opens a window, so its
//! very first frame is the right size, at the right density, in the right
//! colours — and the session *publishes* it on the
//! [`NoticeTopic::Desktop`](crate::notice::NoticeTopic::Desktop) system
//! notice whenever it changes any of it, so an application converges on the
//! change even with no window open.
//!
//! Every decode fails closed: a zero extent, a zero scale, an unknown
//! appearance code, or a dirty reserved byte is refused rather than
//! guessed at.
