//! The window-channel IPC protocol (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW2): the reserved
//! rendezvous the desktop session binds and the fixed-width, fail-closed
//! requests an application presents its windows through.
//!
//! The transport reuses the display-service zero-copy shape: an app
//! `shm_create`s a region holding its window frames, hands the session the
//! endpoint-directed `shm_grant` handle once (`Create`), and thereafter
//! presents by **frame index** plus a damage rectangle (`Present`) — no
//! pixel bytes ever cross the IPC. The session keys every window to the
//! kernel-attested identity of the task that created it (`call_peer_origin`),
//! never to anything claimed on the wire, so one app can never present or
//! close another's window.
//!
//! Input travels the other way: the session encodes each routed event as a
//! fixed-width [`WindowEvent`] and sends it to the owning app's own event
//! endpoint (named in `Create`), where the app parks until one arrives.
//! Events are advisory data about the app's own windows; they carry no
//! ambient authority and no secret. The one authority-adjacent field — the
//! [`WindowEvent::FilePicked`] delegation handle — is owner-bound
//! kernel-side (it redeems only when presented by the task it was minted
//! to, `fd_redeem`), so the number is useless to any observer or forger;
//! an app still accepts events only from the session identity the create
//! reply named.
//!
//! Requests are the fixed-width [`WindowRequest`]. `Create` answers with
//! the [`WINDOW_CREATE_REPLY_LEN`]-byte window-id reply
//! ([`encode_create_reply`] / [`decode_create_reply`]); `Present` and
//! `Close` answer with the shared status frame
//! ([`crate::reply::encode_status_reply`] /
//! [`crate::reply::decode_status_reply`]). Every decode fails closed: an
//! unknown magic, version, operation, format, an out-of-bounds frame
//! count, an empty damage rectangle, a malformed title, a minimum client
//! size declared by a window that cannot be resized, a request frame that
//! is not exactly as long as its operation, or a dirty reserved field
//! refuses rather than guessing.
