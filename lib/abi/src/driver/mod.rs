//! Driver class trait surface (Stage 4 of `PLAN.md`).
//!
//! This module is the single source of truth for the user/kernel ABI that
//! sits between a loaded driver module (`.rxe` binary)
//! and its host. The host lives in user space by default
//! and dispatches calls into one of the driver-class traits defined in
//! the submodules below:
//!
//! * [`display`] — framebuffer and GPU surfaces.
//! * [`filesystem`] — mountable filesystems.
//! * [`block`] — block-addressable storage.
//! * [`net`] — link-layer network interfaces.
//! * [`input`] — keyboard / pointer / scroll input.
//! * [`bus`] — bus enumeration (PCI, MMIO, virtio).
//! * [`rtc`] — the board's battery-backed real-time clock.
//! * [`accelerator`] — offload engines that compute rather than move.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! A driver progresses through four observable states:
//!
//! 1. **Load** — the host parses the signed [`DriverManifest`] (this
//!    module) and verifies the requested capabilities against the
//!    caller's grant. Mismatch produces [`DriverError::PermissionDenied`].
//! 2. **Init** — the host calls the driver-supplied
//!    `pub fn register(host: &dyn DriverHost) -> Result<DriverHandle,
//!    DriverError>` entry point. The driver returns a
//!    [`DriverHandle`]; that handle is the only public proof of a live
//!    driver instance.
//! 3. **Run** — the host dispatches class-trait methods on behalf of
//!    callers. Every method is capability-gated *at the dispatch
//!    site*; the trait implementation never re-checks.
//! 4. **Unload** — the host drops the [`DriverHandle`]; the driver's
//!    `Drop` impl quiesces hardware and releases capabilities.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! Loading any driver requires
//! [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`](crate::CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD).
//! Loading a driver whose manifest declares
//! [`DriverKind::InKernel`] additionally requires
//! [`CapabilityId::DRV_KERNEL`](crate::CapabilityId::DRV_KERNEL).
//! Class traits document their own per-method capability gates.
