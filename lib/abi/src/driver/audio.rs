//! Audio device class (`drivers/audio/*`): the PCM vocabulary every layer of
//! the audio stack shares, and the facts a device reports about the sinks and
//! sources it presents (`plans/SOUND.md`).
//!
//! The vocabulary is defined once here because four independent layers must
//! agree on it exactly — the decoder that produces samples, the engine that
//! mixes them, the device channel that carries them, and the driver that
//! clocks them out. A sample format, a channel map or a frame position that
//! meant something slightly different in two of those would be a silent
//! corruption rather than a refusal.
//!
//! # Positions are frames, and frames are monotone
//!
//! Every position in the stack is a [`Frames`] count from the start of a
//! stream, never a byte offset and never a wrapping index. At 192 kHz a
//! `u64` frame counter runs for about three million years, so the whole
//! class of wrap-around arithmetic bugs is deleted rather than defended
//! against, and a client can name an exact frame to start, stop, or seek at.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! Every value here is validated at construction and re-validated on decode:
//! an undefined format or channel position, a duplicate position in a map, a
//! rate outside the range any real converter runs at, or a gain range whose
//! bounds are inverted is a typed [`Errno`], never a guess.
