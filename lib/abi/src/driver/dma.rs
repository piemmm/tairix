//! Owned DMA region ABI types (`abi-v1`).
//!
//! These types are the host↔driver ABI seam for DMA-able memory.
//! They live in `lib/abi` (rather than in `drivers/bus/virtio`)
//! because every driver-class trait that a host implements — and the
//! [`DriverHost::virtio_host`] accessor on the host trait itself —
//! has to be able to name them without pulling in `drivers/bus/*`.
//! That would invert the dependency direction and violate.
//!
//! The [`PoolId`], [`SlabFreeFn`], and [`DmaSlab`] surface is
//! identical to the surface previously exposed from
//! `drivers/bus/virtio::dma`; that crate now re-exports these
//! definitions for source compatibility. The `BounceBuffer` wrapper
//! is virtio-specific and stays in the virtio crate.
//!
//! No allocation: the crate-wide `no_std` and no-allocation
//! invariants documented in `lib/abi`'s crate-root rustdoc are
//! preserved. The unit tests for these types live in
//! `drivers/bus/virtio/src/dma.rs` (which is permitted to depend on
//! `alloc`) and exercise the surface through the re-export.
