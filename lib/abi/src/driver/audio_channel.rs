//! `audiochan-v1`: the device-channel control plane between the audio mixer
//! service and an audio driver process (`plans/SOUND.md`).
//!
//! [`audio_ring`](super::audio_ring) defines the *in-region* PCM transport;
//! this module defines the *IPC control plane* that establishes and drives
//! that region. The driver owns the device — its registers, its DMA window,
//! its interrupt — and serves a call endpoint; the mixer is the one client,
//! and it owns the shared sample region.
//!
//! # The shape, and why it is this one
//!
//! The network device channel established the pattern and audio follows it:
//! the driver serves, the client `shm_create`s the region, `shm_grant`s it to
//! the driver's endpoint, and forwards the unforgeable grant handle in
//! [`AudioChannelRequest::Attach`]. The driver `shm_map`s exactly that one
//! region (`SHM_MAP` is owner-checked, so the handle is useless to a
//! bystander — no ambient authority).
//!
//! Configuration comes *before* attachment, which is the one deliberate
//! difference: a device answers [`AudioChannelRequest::Configure`] with what
//! it can actually meet, and the ring's geometry is derived from that answer.
//! A client that asked for a rate the converter does not have gets told the
//! rate it will get rather than a refusal, and there is exactly one place the
//! two sides compute the region's shape from ([`ConfigureGrant::geometry`]),
//! so they cannot disagree about how large it is.
//!
//! # The driver copies, and that is the point
//!
//! Once per period the driver copies between the shared ring and its own DMA
//! buffer. A zero-copy arrangement would mean publishing the driver's DMA
//! window to another process; the driver owning that window absolutely is
//! worth far more than the copy costs, which at 48 kHz stereo 32-bit and a
//! five-millisecond period is under 400 KiB/s.
//!
//! # Nothing spins
//!
//! Between doorbells the driver parks on its device interrupt. When a period
//! elapses it wakes the mixer with an [`AudioChannelNotify`] `ipc_send` to the
//! attach port, and the mixer — parked on that port in its wait set — issues
//! the next [`AudioChannelRequest::Service`]. The device's own period
//! interrupt is the only timer in the stack.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! Every decode is total and validates whole: an unknown magic, version or
//! operation byte, a dirty reserved field, an endpoint index past the device's
//! own bound, an out-of-range geometry, or a notification carrying a field its
//! kind does not define refuses with one typed [`Errno`] rather than guessing.
