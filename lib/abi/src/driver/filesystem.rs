//! Filesystem driver class (`drivers/filesystem/*`).
//!
//! A filesystem driver attaches a block-backed image to a mount point
//! and detaches it again. Path resolution, permission enforcement,
//! and the VFS itself live in `kernel/core` (Stage 5); this trait
//! exposes only the operations the host needs in order to wire a
//! driver into the mount table.
//!
//! The block-device side of the mount lives behind the
//! [`block::Block`](crate::driver::block::Block) trait; this module
//! does not duplicate it.
