//! The Switchboard tray-summary IPC protocol (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T9/T10):
//! the reserved rendezvous the desktop session binds and the fixed-width,
//! fail-closed request the Switchboard monitor service publishes a compact
//! tray-signal summary through.
//!
//! The Switchboard is a dedicated, capability-sized system service (its own
//! signed bundle, `userland/gui/switchboard`) that samples the live system
//! through the System Information API and publishes an at-a-glance summary —
//! active background jobs, recovery-candidate count, overall CPU load,
//! resource pressure (how many distinct resources are pressured, and the
//! single dominant one that drives the icon's rail), and the busiest task
//! (for the taskbar icon's hover readout) — to the desktop session, which
//! drives the always-right-most Switchboard taskbar icon from it.
//! Publication is event-driven (on change), never polled.
//!
//! The session keys the summary to the kernel-attested identity of the
//! Switchboard instance that published it
//! ([`crate::origin`] / `call_peer_origin`), never to anything claimed on
//! the wire — attested per request, exactly like the notification channel's
//! producer identity, and unrestricted-sender at bind (the endpoint itself
//! carries no per-request authority check beyond that attestation).
//!
//! The top-task name is producer-supplied **display text** validated at
//! construction and again at decode (bounded UTF-8, no control characters,
//! never sanitised): it names a process for a hover readout and carries no
//! authority, exactly like a notification title or a window title.
//!
//! Every operation is a fixed-width [`SwitchboardRequest`]. A
//! [`SwitchboardRequest::PublishSummary`] is answered with the longer
//! publish frame ([`encode_publish_reply`] / [`decode_publish_reply`]),
//! which carries the serving session's own kernel-attested [`ProcId`]; the
//! remaining operations are answered with the shared status frame
//! ([`crate::reply::encode_status_reply`] /
//! [`crate::reply::decode_status_reply`]) — success, or a typed refusal.
//! Every decode fails closed: an unknown magic, version, or operation, an
//! out-of-range pressure kind, pressured-resource count, or permille
//! fraction, an over-long or malformed top-task name, a zero owner id, or a
//! dirty reserved field refuses rather than guessing.
//!
//! # The two directions (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T11)
//!
//! The monitor renders the desktop's window stack but owns none of it, so
//! the actions its panel offers over *other* processes' windows —
//! switch-to-window and restart-a-hung-app — are requested of the session
//! rather than performed by the service:
//! [`SwitchboardRequest::ActivateOwner`] raises an owner's front window and
//! [`SwitchboardRequest::RestartOwner`] re-launches it through the
//! session's own attested launch path. The session honours either only from
//! the attested origin of the Switchboard instance it launched, and
//! validates the named owner against its own live window registry, so a
//! stale or invented owner id fails closed instead of reaching a stranger's
//! process.
//!
//! The reverse direction is a per-instance command mailbox
//! ([`command_endpoint_for`]) the service binds under its own task id: the
//! session sends [`SwitchboardCommand::OpenPanel`] when the user opens the
//! tray icon, and [`SwitchboardCommand::SeatReport`] to hand over the one
//! fact only the session holds — which window owners have stopped draining
//! their event mailbox and are therefore unresponsive.
//! [`SwitchboardCommand::OwnerBundle`] is the other such fact: which installed
//! bundle *directory* a window owner's kernel-attested application resolves
//! to, which only the session — the thing that walks the program stores —
//! knows. The
//! service authenticates every command against the session [`ProcId`] the
//! publish reply attested, never a wire claim, and joins the reported owners
//! against the process list it already samples rather than trusting names
//! from the wire.
//!
//! [`SwitchboardCommand::WatchMachine`] asks for the one frame this endpoint
//! carries besides a [`SwitchboardRequest`]: the [`MachineReport`] the
//! desktop's System Monitor screensaver draws, published each sample while
//! one watches.
