//! The wait-set control vocabulary (`plans/USB.md` — the asynchronous
//! host-controller event loop).
//!
//! A **wait-set** is a kernel object that multiplexes the readiness of
//! several heterogeneous event sources so one process can service them all
//! without a busy poll loop (the charter forbids spinning a core). It is the
//! scalable analogue of `epoll`/`kqueue`: membership is registered once and
//! persists across waits, so the set grows on demand rather than capping the
//! number of sources at a fixed ceiling, and the wait syscall passes only the
//! set handle — never a per-wait array.
//!
//! The three syscalls that drive a wait-set are
//! [`crate::SyscallNumber::WAITSET_CREATE`] (mint the object),
//! [`crate::SyscallNumber::WAITSET_CTL`] (add/remove a member), and
//! [`crate::SyscallNumber::WAITSET_WAIT`] (block until a member is ready).
//! This module defines the two small scalar enumerations those syscalls carry
//! as arguments; the rest of the contract is the syscall arguments themselves,
//! so there is no packed wire format here (the values cross the syscall
//! boundary as plain registers, not as a serialised struct).
