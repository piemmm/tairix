//! Process-instance identity carried across the ABI.
//!
//! A [`ProcId`] is a kernel-generated 128-bit identifier assigned to a
//! process instance when it is admitted. It is **not** the reusable numeric
//! PID: the kernel hands out PIDs from a small recycled space, so two process
//! lifetimes can share a PID, but they never share a `ProcId`. Security
//! attribution (the hash-chained audit log) and any future origin record can
//! therefore distinguish "the login that ran as PID 42 this morning" from "the
//! shell that reused PID 42 this afternoon" without ambiguity.
//!
//! The value is generated entirely kernel-side from the single kernel random
//! subsystem mixed with a monotonic per-boot counter; user space never
//! supplies or influences it, so a caller can neither forge another instance's
//! identity nor predict its own ahead of admission. A process instance can
//! only ever observe its own `ProcId`, never mint one.
//!
//! The 16-byte width and the all-zero [`ProcId::KERNEL`] sentinel are part of
//! the `abi-v1` contract.
//!
//! This module also defines the kernel-attested [`Origin`] record — the
//! authoritative identity of the principal that performed an action, built
//! entirely from kernel state and never from caller-supplied bytes — together
//! with its [`TrustDomain`] classification and the non-secret
//! [`CapabilitySummary`] it carries.
