//! Userland filesystem API wire types (`PREREQUISITES.md` P-A).
//!
//! These types describe the data a program exchanges with the kernel over
//! the `fs_open` / `fs_read` / `fs_write` / `fs_readdir` / `fs_stat` /
//! `fs_truncate` / `fs_sync` / `fs_mkdir` / `fs_unlink` / `fs_close`
//! syscalls. The syscalls themselves resolve a path or an open-file handle
//! against the kernel's secured VFS, which makes every per-inode
//! owner/mode/ACL/capability decision; this module only fixes the *shapes*
//! that cross the boundary, so the kernel and `lib/rt` cannot drift
//! (no duplication).
//!
//! Like the rest of the ABI surface the encodings are little-endian and
//! allocation-free, and every decoder treats its bytes as untrusted input:
//! it bounds-checks against the structure's `WIRE_LEN` and fails closed with
//! an [`Errno`] rather than indexing out of range.
