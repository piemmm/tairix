//! The display-service IPC protocol (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D7b): the reserved
//! rendezvous a display-driver service binds and the fixed-width,
//! fail-closed requests a seat owner presents frames through.
//!
//! The transport is deliberately zero-copy: a client shares one
//! `shm_create` region holding its frames, hands the service the
//! endpoint-directed `shm_grant` handle once (`Configure`), and thereafter
//! presents by **frame index** (`Present`) — no pixel bytes ever cross the
//! IPC. Every request that acts *for a seat* carries that seat's id, and the
//! service gates each one (including `Query`) on the caller's live seat lease
//! through the kernel's `call_peer_seat` oracle-free check, so only the seat
//! owner can learn the mode, configure frames, or scan out.
//!
//! [`DisplayRequest::QueryStats`] is the one operation that acts for no seat:
//! it describes the *device* this service drives, for the monitor that draws
//! graphics utilisation. It is gated on the caller's kernel-attested
//! `CAP_SYSINFO_HW` instead — a reader that holds no lease, and never will,
//! must still be able to read hardware utilisation, and that is the authority
//! the hardware inventory it details is already read under.
//!
//! A `Present` names a whole frame's damage in one call: it carries a
//! [`DamageList`] of up to [`MAX_DAMAGE_RECTS`] rectangles inline, so a
//! frame that changed two far-apart places costs one round trip and two
//! rectangle-sized blits rather than a round trip each and a blit of the
//! box spanning them.
//!
//! [`DisplayRequest::SetPower`] switches the seat's display off and on again
//! for the configuration that asked, and never outlives it.
//!
//! Requests are the fixed-width [`DisplayRequest`]. `Configure`, `Present`
//! and `SetPower` answer with the shared status frame
//! ([`crate::reply::encode_status_reply`] /
//! [`crate::reply::decode_status_reply`]); `Query` answers with the
//! [`DISPLAY_MODE_REPLY_LEN`]-byte mode reply ([`encode_mode_reply`] /
//! [`decode_mode_reply`]); `QueryStats` with the
//! [`DISPLAY_STATS_REPLY_LEN`]-byte statistics reply ([`encode_stats_reply`] /
//! [`decode_stats_reply`]). Every decode fails closed: an unknown magic,
//! version, operation, format, an out-of-bounds frame count, an empty
//! damage rectangle, or a dirty reserved field refuses rather than
//! guessing.
