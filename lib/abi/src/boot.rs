//! Per-boot identity carried across the ABI.
//!
//! A [`BootId`] is a 128-bit value the kernel mints **once per boot** from its
//! single cryptographic random subsystem. It is stable for the lifetime of a
//! boot and fresh across boots: two boots of the same installation never share
//! a `BootId` (with overwhelming probability), and user space can neither
//! supply nor influence it.
//!
//! The value is not a secret — it is a public per-boot nonce. Its purpose is to
//! bind boot-scoped state to the boot that produced it: the system log binds
//! each stream's hash-chain genesis to `machine-id-hash`, the stream, and the
//! `BootId` (`plans/SYSLOG.md` §7.1), and signed anchors record it (§7.3), so a
//! log segment cannot be silently replayed from a different boot. Because it is
//! not secret, it is exposed read-only to any task through the `boot_id_get`
//! syscall.
//!
//! The 16-byte width and the all-zero [`BootId::UNSET`] sentinel are part of
//! the `abi-v1` contract.
//!
//! [`BootFacts`] is the second per-boot value this module carries: the
//! kernel-attested, boot-static machine summary — the CPU architecture, the
//! boot CPU's discovered model name ([`CpuName`]), the number of processor
//! cores brought under the scheduler, and the installed physical memory the
//! boot path discovered. Like the boot id it is not a
//! secret (any task can measure its own timing across cores; the figures are
//! the machine's public shape, not its state), so it is exposed read-only to
//! any task through the ungated `boot_facts_get` syscall. Unlike the live
//! `sysinfo` figures it never changes after boot, carries no per-process or
//! usage detail, and grants no authority.
//!
//! [`BootSession`] is the third: the operator's one-boot choice of a text
//! or graphical login, made in the pre-boot Supervisor and read back by
//! the ungated `boot_session_get` syscall.
