//! The service-manager control IPC protocol (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md`
//! SVC-8).
//!
//! The service manager (PID 1, and a per-user manager instance) owns four
//! reserved synchronous call endpoints:
//!
//! * [`SERVICE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT`] drives a registered service's **runtime**
//!   lifecycle — `start` a down service now, or `stop` a running one;
//! * [`SERVICE_ENROL_ENDPOINT`] changes its **persistent** enrolment —
//!   `enable` or `disable`, which the manager records in the registration
//!   store and obeys on the next boot;
//! * [`SERVICE_ACTIVATION_ENDPOINT`] brokers a **client's** connection to a
//!   shared service, activating it on demand and parking the client until it
//!   is ready;
//! * [`SERVICE_NOTICE_ENDPOINT`] carries a service's own self-report
//!   ([`crate::ServiceNotice`]) — a readiness announcement or a liveness
//!   renewal — attributed to the kernel-attested sender.
//!
//! They are four endpoints rather than operations on one because the acts
//! differ in authority and the answers differ in kind: an administrator
//! reaches the first two, any client the third, and a service speaks only for
//! itself on the fourth. Keeping them apart is what lets their gates diverge
//! without reshaping any of the protocols, and what makes them scope-derived
//! together when a per-user manager is spawned. Observability (`status`) is on
//! none of them: it is served through the System Information API, never a
//! control-reply scrape.
//!
//! This module is the wire contract for the three name-carrying requests
//! (the notice's own frame is [`crate::ServiceNotice`], which carries no name),
//! modelled on the
//! read-only mailbox and font protocols ([`crate::mailbox_ipc`],
//! [`crate::font_ipc`]): a fixed-size, bounds-checked request framing and a
//! status-framed reply, both little-endian, `no_std` and allocation-free (the
//! request name borrows the caller's buffer). Like those, it is an IPC-protocol
//! module, so it is outside the generated C-ABI header and its decoders are
//! enrolled in the `lib/abi` fuzz harness.
//!
//! **Authorization is the endpoint's, not this module's.** The kernel gates
//! *reaching* the endpoint on the capability the manager binds it with (the
//! reserved-bind gate plus a required send capability), so the receiver does
//! not re-check a caller capability here. The request carries only the
//! operation and the target service name; the manager validates the name
//! against its own strict service-name policy before it touches any state (fail
//! closed).
//!
//! Both requests share one fixed [`REQUEST_LEN`]-byte frame (little-endian),
//! so there is a single framing to audit and fuzz; only the magic and the
//! operation vocabulary differ:
//!
//! ```text
//!  0  magic u32     = SERVICE_CONTROL_MAGIC | SERVICE_ENROL_MAGIC
//!  4  version u16   = SERVICE_CONTROL_VERSION_V1
//!  6  op u16        (ServiceControlOp | ServiceEnrolOp)
//!  8  name_len u16  (0..=SERVICE_MANIFEST_MAX_NAME_LEN)
//! 10  reserved u16  = 0
//! 12  name [SERVICE_MANIFEST_MAX_NAME_LEN] (name_len bytes, rest zero)
//! ```
//!
//! A frame carrying one endpoint's magic can therefore never be accepted by
//! the other's decoder, so an operation cannot be smuggled onto the endpoint
//! whose authority it was not meant for.
