//! Wire-level pointer input event delivered over the kernel input channel.
//!
//! A pointing device reports motion, presses, and releases. On a running
//! system those reports reach the user-space desktop as a stream of framed
//! records over a capability-checked kernel input channel; this module fixes
//! the *contract* of one such record, [`PointerInput`]. The kernel never hands a parser the device's structure: it hands a
//! buffer, and [`PointerInput::from_bytes`] validates every field and fails
//! closed.
//!
//! The record is **device-resolved but screen-independent**: motion is the
//! relative displacement the device reported ([`MovedBy`](PointerInput::MovedBy)),
//! and a button edge names a *resolved* button (primary / secondary /
//! middle), never a raw platform keycode. Turning this stream into an
//! absolute on-screen pointer position — accumulating displacements and
//! clamping to the display extent — is the **seat owner's** policy: only the
//! desktop session that owns the compositor knows the screen's pixel size
//! (and its runtime scale), so the position lives there, never in a driver.
//! An input driver therefore needs no display-geometry authority at all —
//! it decodes its device and injects, and the kernel seat channel is a dumb,
//! validated pipe. (The desktop's `no_std` GUI vocabulary — `lib/input`'s
//! absolute `PointerMoved` — is what the seat owner produces *after* that
//! accumulation.)
//!
//! Keyboard input is modelled alongside the pointer by [`KeyInput`]: the
//! *desktop-level* key event the window manager delivers to the focused
//! surface — a produced [`KeyValue`] (a Unicode character, or a named
//! non-character key) plus the [`Modifiers`] held while it was produced. As
//! with the pointer, this is **not** the device-level report: turning raw
//! platform keycodes and a keyboard layout into a produced character is policy
//! that lives above the driver, not a second copy of the same data.
//! [`KeyInput::from_bytes`] validates every field and fails closed on
//! untrusted input.
//!
//! # Relationship to the driver input ABI
//!
//! This is **not** a duplicate of [`crate::driver::input::InputEvent`]. That type is the *device-level* contract an input
//! driver reports across the [`Input`](crate::driver::input::Input) driver
//! trait: single-axis pointer *deltas*, scroll in scroll units, and platform keycodes,
//! one event per axis or edge. [`PointerInput`] is the *seat-channel* record
//! an input-driver process injects (`pointer_inject`): button keycodes are
//! resolved to the closed button set, and a scroll wheel becomes a
//! [`Scrolled`](PointerInput::Scrolled) record in scroll units. [`PointerInput::from_device_event`] is the one
//! spelling of that mapping, shared by every pointer-input driver.
//!
//! # Wire layout
//!
//! A record is exactly [`PointerInput::WIRE_LEN`] bytes, little-endian:
//!
//! | offset | size | field      | meaning                                  |
//! |-------:|-----:|------------|------------------------------------------|
//! |      0 |    4 | `magic`    | [`POINTER_INPUT_MAGIC`]                   |
//! |      4 |    2 | `version`  | ABI version ([`crate::ABI_VERSION_CURRENT`]) |
//! |      6 |    2 | `kind`     | [`KIND_MOVED_BY`] / [`KIND_PRESSED`] / [`KIND_RELEASED`] / [`KIND_SCROLLED`] |
//! |      8 |    2 | `button`   | [`BUTTON_NONE`] for motion/scroll, else a button code |
//! |     10 |    2 | `reserved` | must be zero                             |
//! |     12 |    4 | `dx`       | signed x displacement / scroll units     |
//! |     16 |    4 | `dy`       | signed y displacement / scroll units     |
//!
//! The displacement fields carry the reported motion for a
//! [`MovedBy`](PointerInput::MovedBy) record, the signed scroll units for a
//! [`Scrolled`](PointerInput::Scrolled) record, and must be zero for a press
//! or release (a real pointing device reports motion separately from clicks,
//! and the seat owner applies a button at the position its accumulated motion
//! established — the same model as `lib/input`). The `button` field is
//! [`BUTTON_NONE`] for motion and scroll and a valid button code for a press
//! or release. Any other combination is wire corruption and is refused.
