//! Syscall identifiers shared between the kernel and user space.
//!
//! This module defines the numeric identifier each syscall carries on the
//! ABI. The kernel's per-architecture dispatch table — landing in
//! `kernel/syscall/src/table.rs` during Stage 2 — is generated from this
//! definition; `cargo xtask abi-check` enforces that the two never drift.
//!
//! ## Stage 1 boundary
//!
//! Only the *numbering* of syscalls is fixed here. The kernel-side dispatch
//! table is intentionally not yet introduced (see `PLAN.md` Stage 2). To
//! avoid prematurely triggering the cross-check, the syscall ABI lives in a
//! `syscall.rs` (singular) module rather than the `syscalls.rs` file that
//! `cargo xtask abi-check` watches for. The file `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs`
//! will be introduced together with `kernel/syscall/src/table.rs` so that
//! the diff tool always sees both halves.
