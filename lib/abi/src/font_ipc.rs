//! The font-service IPC protocol (`plans/FONT-SERVICE.md` FS-1): the
//! reserved rendezvous the sandboxed OS font service (`fontd`) binds, and
//! the fixed-width, fail-closed requests a text-drawing client presents to
//! obtain a run of glyphs' coverage bitmaps, a family's line metrics, or the
//! set of installed families.
//!
//! Text rendering is a single, sandboxed OS resource: no process but `fontd`
//! holds a font face or an outline rasteriser, and a client draws by asking
//! this endpoint for the 8-bit coverage of a bounded *run* of Unicode scalars
//! at a chosen pixel height. The transport carries no font bytes and no
//! outlines — only the small coverage bitmaps the client blits — so a
//! malformed face can fault only the service's sandbox, never the compositor
//! or a terminal.
//!
//! # A run, not a glyph, because the caller is drawing a frame
//!
//! A client asks per *run* of text rather than per character: the surface
//! that draws a label owes the user a frame, and one round trip per
//! not-yet-cached character turned a newly-opened window into a burst of
//! them. A reply answers as many of the run as its frame holds, in order,
//! and states how many — one glyph at the extreme of the coverage bound
//! fills a frame on its own, so a batch is a *prefix* and the client asks
//! again for any remainder. At the sizes a desktop draws, one round trip
//! covers any realistic run.
//!
//! # Proportional and monospace families are one protocol
//!
//! A request names the **family** it wants, and every glyph reply carries
//! that glyph's own pen advance and left side bearing. A monospace family
//! simply reports the same advance for every glyph and a
//! [`FontMetrics::monospace_advance`] a caller can lay a character grid out
//! with; a proportional family reports zero there, and its callers advance
//! the pen per glyph. There is one drawing path for both. A monospace
//! reply is also *shaped* like its cell — one cell wide, two for a
//! double-width scalar, with a zero bearing — so a grid blits it at the cell
//! origin.
//!
//! The protocol is modelled on [`crate::display_ipc`] / [`crate::mailbox_ipc`]:
//! a fixed-width [`FontRequest`] in, and a status-framed reply out. Drawing
//! text is not a security boundary, so the endpoint requires no capability of
//! its own; the reply nonetheless validates every field and fails closed on a
//! corrupt frame. Every request and reply is versioned and hashed under the
//! same ABI discipline as the syscall table and frozen on the first release —
//! mutable now, `abi-v1` is not frozen.
