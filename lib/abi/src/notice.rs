//! System notices: the one state-edge broadcast a process converges on
//! (`plans/NOTICE.md`).
//!
//! A notice is a **state edge**, not an occurrence. Each [`NoticeTopic`] names
//! one machine-wide value; a subscriber learns only that the value moved and
//! then reads the current one, so there is no queue, no history, nothing to
//! overflow, and nothing to drop. That is what makes it the right shape for
//! facts a process must *agree* with rather than witness: the desktop's
//! appearance and density, the mount table's composition, the memory-pressure
//! band, the boot seat's display lease.
//!
//! The mechanism is three parts:
//!
//! * [`WaitSourceKind::SystemNotice`](crate::WaitSourceKind::SystemNotice) —
//!   the wait-set member whose `id` is the topic, ready when the topic's
//!   generation differs from the one the member last observed.
//! * [`SyscallNumber::NOTICE_READ`](crate::SyscallNumber::NOTICE_READ) — the
//!   unprivileged, non-blocking read of a topic's current payload, so a woken
//!   subscriber has the value without an IPC round trip.
//! * [`SyscallNumber::NOTICE_PUBLISH`](crate::SyscallNumber::NOTICE_PUBLISH) —
//!   the publish, authorised per topic and fail-closed.
//!
//! # Payload shapes are exact, not merely bounded
//!
//! Every topic carries a payload of one fixed length ([`NoticeTopic::payload_len`]),
//! so a publish of any other length is refused rather than stored and handed
//! to a subscriber that would then have to defend against it. [`Notice`] is
//! the one encode/decode for all of them: the publisher writes through it and
//! the subscriber reads through it, so neither can spell a payload the other
//! would not accept.
