//! The two `abi-v1` syscalls [`RtDriverHost`](crate::RtDriverHost) issues,
//! behind a host-testable seam.
//!
//! [`GrantSyscalls`] abstracts the `mmio_map` and `dma_alloc` syscall
//! wrappers so the host's grant-resolution and address-translation logic is
//! unit-tested without a kernel — exactly as the bus drivers
//! mock their register windows. Production driver processes use
//! [`RtGrantSyscalls`], the zero-sized forwarder to `tairix_rt`, so the one
//! syscall trap is not duplicated.
