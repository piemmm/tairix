//! The one bounded walk of the installed program stores.
//!
//! Three consumers need the same answer to "which bundles are installed, and
//! what does each one's own signed manifest say?": the program-library
//! `rescan`, the file manager's open-with table, and the desktop session's
//! icon-bar identity index. Each had its own copy of the walk, its own depth
//! and entry bounds, and its own manifest decode; this crate is that walk,
//! defined once.
//!
//! Reading is injected through [`StoreReader`], so the crate performs no I/O
//! and holds no authority — the consumer's own capability-checked filesystem
//! access does. It verifies no signature either: a manifest read here is a
//! *claim* the walk decodes and bounds, and only the load gate turns a claim
//! into an attested identity.
//!
//! # What the walk guarantees
//!
//! * **Fixed precedence.** [`store_roots`] spells the roots in the order a
//!   program word resolves against them, and [`identity_roots`] the wider set
//!   a running process's identity is resolved against, so a duplicate
//!   resolves to the shipped bundle deterministically rather than to whichever
//!   listing came back first. Each visited bundle carries the index of the
//!   root it was found under, so a consumer resolving a collision reads the
//!   precedence rather than re-deriving it from path prefixes.
//! * **Contained.** Bundles may be filed in nested plain subdirectories, so
//!   the walk descends — to [`MAX_WALK_DEPTH`], and across no more than
//!   [`MAX_WALK_ENTRIES`] directory entries in total. A tree that exhausts
//!   either fails the whole scan closed rather than walking on. A `.app`
//!   directory is a sealed unit and is never descended into.
//! * **Fail-closed per bundle.** A bundle whose manifest is absent,
//!   unreadable, over-long, or undecodable contributes nothing and is
//!   counted, so one broken bundle costs only itself.
//! * **Deterministic.** Listings are consumed in sorted order, so the same
//!   tree always yields the same sequence.
