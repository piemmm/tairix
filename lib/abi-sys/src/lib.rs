//! `tairix-abi-sys` — the C-callable `abi-v1` syscall stub runtime.
//!
//! This crate is the implementation behind the generated C header
//! (`include/tairix/tairix_syscall.h`, produced by `cargo xtask c-header`).
//! It exports one `extern "C"` function per `abi-v1` syscall, named
//! `tairix_sys_<name>` (for example `tairix_sys_ipc_send`), each of which marshals
//! its arguments into the per-architecture syscall registers, issues the
//! trap, and returns the kernel's result. A program **not** written in Rust
//! (C first, then any language with a C FFI) links this runtime to reach the
//! TAIRiX kernel.
//!
//! It is the curated `/System/Libraries/` class *System runtime / C ABI*: deliberately minimal — it marshals to the kernel and
//! nothing more — and dynamically linked, so one security update covers every
//! consumer. See `plans/CCOMPAT.md` (stage CC2) for the staged build plan and
//! its security posture.
//!
//! # Not a privileged path
//!
//! These stubs add **no** authority (`plans/CCOMPAT.md`). Every capability check and every input validation happens kernel-side,
//! on the far side of the trap, exactly as for a Rust caller; a C program
//! reaches no syscall it could not reach in Rust and gains nothing by being C.
//! Because the kernel re-validates every argument and fails closed, no
//! argument value passed to a `tairix_sys_*` function can cause undefined
//! behaviour, so the stubs are safe `extern "C"` functions.
//!
//! # Symbol naming
//!
//! Each entry point is pinned to the stable symbol `tairix_sys_<name>` with
//! `#[export_name = …]` so the Rust compiler does not mangle it (`extern "C"`
//! alone fixes only the calling convention, not the symbol name). The Rust
//! item names are free to be idiomatic; only the exported symbol is frozen.
//!
//! # Panic-free boundary
//!
//! An unwind across an `extern "C"` boundary is undefined behaviour, so every
//! entry point is panic-free: each performs only constant-index array writes
//! and infallible integer casts before issuing the trap. Errors are reported
//! as the kernel's `int32_t` `TAIRIX_E_*` codes in the return value, never as a
//! panic.
//!
//! # Targets
//!
//! The user→kernel trap itself lives once, in `tairix-abi-trap`: this crate only marshals each call into register form
//! and hands it to [`tairix_abi_trap::raw_syscall`]. The trap instruction is
//! compiled in only for the three native Tier-1 targets (`x86_64`, `aarch64`,
//! `riscv64`); `wasm32` has no trap instruction and is out of scope for this
//! runtime (`plans/CCOMPAT.md` §1). On the host the entry points still build
//! and link (the marshalling logic is host-tested through the trap crate's
//! injectable `host-seam`), but there is no kernel to service the call.
