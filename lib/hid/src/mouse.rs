//! HID boot-protocol mouse report decode (USB HID 1.11 §B.2).
//!
//! A boot mouse delivers a report of at least 3 bytes:
//!
//! | byte | content                                              |
//! |------|------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 0    | button bitmap (bit 0 left, bit 1 right, bit 2 middle) |
//! | 1    | signed X displacement (two's complement)             |
//! | 2    | signed Y displacement (two's complement)             |
//! | 3    | signed wheel displacement (common extension, optional) |
//! | 4..  | device-specific (ignored)                            |
//!
//! Buttons carry *state* and are diffed against the previous report;
//! displacements are *edges* and surface as `Pointer` / `Scroll` deltas on
//! the shared axis encoding ([`crate::AXIS_X`] / [`crate::AXIS_Y`]), which
//! counts downward: the wheel byte counts rotation away from the user, so it
//! is negated on the way.
