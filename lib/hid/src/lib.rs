//! TAIRiX HID boot-protocol decode + console producer (`lib/hid`).
//!
//! This is the arch-neutral, transport-agnostic HID boot-protocol *decode*
//! logic the USB-HID keyboard/mouse **class** drivers are built from. It lives
//! in `lib/*` — not in a driver crate — so a class driver
//! (`drivers/input/usb_kbd`, …) composes it without a `drivers/*`→`drivers/*`
//! dependency, exactly as the bus-agnostic xHCI protocol lives in the
//! `tairix_usb` crate rather than the xHCI driver. Controller bring-up and
//! enumeration are **not** here: they belong to the host-controller driver
//! (`drivers/bus/usb/xhci`), which serves a class driver's transfers over the
//! URB transport (`plans/USB.md`).
//!
//! # What it decodes
//!
//! The two **HID boot-protocol** report formats — the fixed 8-byte keyboard
//! report and the 3-or-more-byte mouse report (USB HID 1.11 Appendix B) —
//! into platform-neutral [`tairix_abi::driver::input::InputEvent`]s. Boot
//! protocol is the fixed report shape every USB keyboard and mouse must speak
//! without a report-descriptor parse, which makes it the correct first
//! bring-up path for the Pi 4's USB ports (`plans/PI.md` P10): the decoder
//! needs no descriptor parsing and is proven host-side.
//!
//! # Layered seam
//!
//! The decoders ([`BootKeyboard`], [`BootMouse`]) are written against the
//! [`ReportSource`] seam, defined in `lib/abi` (`tairix_abi::driver::input`)
//! because its producer is the class driver's URB transport (which submits
//! interrupt-IN URBs to the host-controller driver servicing the device's
//! interrupt-IN endpoint), and a `lib/*` crate depends only on other `lib/*`
//! crates. Host tests drive the decoders over a mock report queue: the
//! protocol layer is proven host-side, the transport below it on metal.
//!
//! # Event encoding
//!
//! * Keyboard keys surface as [`InputEventKind::Key`] events whose `code` is
//!   the **HID usage ID** from usage page `0x07` (`0x04` = `A`, …); the eight
//!   boot modifiers surface as usages `0xE0..=0xE7`
//!   ([`keyboard::MODIFIER_USAGE_BASE`]). `value` is `1` for a press and `0`
//!   for a release.
//! * For a directly attached keyboard the [`console`] producer resolves those
//!   usage edges into the [`Key`](tairix_input::Key) a US layout produces —
//!   applying the held modifiers and caps/num lock — and emits the decoded
//!   [`KeyInput`](tairix_abi::input::KeyInput) record through the shared
//!   `lib/keymap` map; a driver loop injects each record through the
//!   `key_inject` syscall ([`pump_once`], `plans/PI.md` P11), leaving the
//!   encoding and routing to the kernel input-focus arbiter. Key repeat remains a higher-layer concern.
//! * Mouse buttons surface as `Key` events with codes
//!   [`POINTER_BUTTON_CODE_BASE`]` + n` (`0x110`/`0x111`/`0x112` for
//!   left/right/middle — the same codes a virtio pointer device delivers, so
//!   the WM sees one button vocabulary).
//! * Motion surfaces as `Pointer` events on axes [`AXIS_X`]/[`AXIS_Y`] and
//!   wheel motion as `Scroll` on [`AXIS_Y`], in the `lib/abi` axis encoding
//!   (`lib/abi/src/driver/input.rs`), which counts downward: the wheel byte
//!   counts away from the user, so it is negated.
//!
//! [`Input`]: tairix_abi::driver::input::Input
//! [`InputEventKind::Key`]: tairix_abi::driver::input::InputEventKind::Key
//! [`Key`]: tairix_input::Key
