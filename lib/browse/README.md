# tairix-browse

Stability tier: **experimental**.

The shared directory-browser engine (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW5): the one
navigation model and themed listing renderer every directory browser in
the system composes, so the `files.app` windowed file manager and the
desktop session's trusted file picker (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6)
can never diverge in navigation semantics, listing policy, or look.

- **Entries** (`Entry`/`EntryKind`): each listed child carries its name,
  its kind — including `Link(LinkTarget)`, which shows a symbolic link
  *and* names what it resolves to, because a file manager needs both
  facts — and the display metadata a file manager needs — apparent
  `size` and the modification `Time64` — mapped straight from the one
  `fs_readdir` stream the source already produced, so no child is opened
  and statted to fill a listing. `EntryKind` refines the VFS's
  file/directory split with the one distinction a manager must make
  structurally: a `<Name>.app` directory is a `Bundle` — a sealed unit the
  user launches, not a folder to descend into.
- **Content-type registry** (`media`): the one closed registry both the drawn
  file-type icon and the "Open With…" association vocabulary read, so the two
  can never drift apart. `MediaType` names a type by its IANA (or TAIRiX
  vendor) media-type spelling (`as_str` / `from_media_str`, round-tripping
  case-insensitively); `media_for_name(name)` maps a filename extension
  (ASCII-case-insensitive, allocating nothing) and `media_for_entry(entry,
  parent)` classifies a listed entry — `inode/directory` for a directory
  whatever its name, `application/x-tairix-service` for a `<Name>.app` listed
  from the system service store (`tairix_abi::SYSTEM_SERVICE_STORE`) and
  `application/x-tairix-app` elsewhere, and the extension's type for a regular
  file, falling closed to `application/octet-stream`. `MediaType::icon` is the
  `lib/icon` `IconKind` drawn for the type: deliberately **many-to-one** and
  the only part of the registry allowed to be, so two types are never merged
  merely because they draw alike (an application declaring the vanished type
  would silently stop matching its own files). `MediaType::parent` is the
  **subclass relation** the freedesktop.org shared-mime-info database models
  (`text/x-csrc` is a subclass of `text/plain`): every readable-text type names
  `text/plain` as its broader type — `image/svg+xml` reaches it through
  `application/xml` — while everything binary names none, the chain is finite
  and acyclic, and association matching walks it, so naming a format precisely
  never narrows what can open it. The whole registry is a **display and offer
  hint only**: it decides a glyph and which applications are *offered*, never
  an operation; authority stays in the VFS and the launcher.
  `icon_for_entry(entry, parent)` is the one classification both views draw
  through: the registry's glyph, except that a plain directory *known* to hold
  something takes `IconKind::FolderFilled`. Only a known answer changes the
  icon, so an unprobed, empty, or unreadable folder is the plain one.
- **Folder occupancy** (`Occupancy`, `DirectorySource::has_children`,
  `Browser::resolve_occupancy`): a directory's `size` is `0` and no VFS
  surface reports a child count, so "does this folder hold anything?" is a
  separate per-child read. An `Entry` carries the four honest answers
  — `Unprobed`, `Empty`, `NonEmpty`, `Indeterminate` (refused or failed) — and
  `resolve_occupancy(range)` answers only the indices its caller passes,
  probing only an entry that still needs one, so a hundred-thousand-entry
  directory costs what is on screen. A refusal is recorded rather than
  retried, and a fresh listing resets every answer. A source that does not
  implement the probe answers `NotImplemented`, which reads as
  `Indeterminate`: the trusted picker takes that default deliberately, so it
  exercises no directory-read authority it does not need. A source that probes
  *elsewhere* answers `Probe::Pending`, which leaves the entry unanswered and
  asks again next resolve — that is what lets a caller resolve occupancy from
  inside a paint while the paint performs no I/O at all.
- **Sort** (`SortMode`/`sort_entries`): the one listing order both views
  share — directories first, then a `Name`/`Size`/`Modified` key with a
  direction, with a case-insensitive name tiebreak so the result never
  depends on the source's incidental order. The default is name-ascending;
  `Browser::set_sort_mode` re-orders in place, keeping the selection on the
  same entry.
- **Scrolling columns** (`column::ScrollColumn`): the one offset-plus-bar
  every scrolling surface here holds — the listing, the places rail, the
  chooser, a Properties window — moved by the wheel (`wheel`) and by the bar's
  own pointer routing
  (`route`) through one definition. The offset is a request the surface's
  geometry clamps each time it is used, so a resize never leaves it past the
  end.
- **Model** (`Browser` over the injected `DirectorySource` seam):
  transactional, fail-closed navigation — descend, climb to the parent,
  refresh, a selection cursor, and the shared sort applied to every
  listing. The new directory is listed *before* any state changes, so a
  refused or failing read leaves the browser exactly where it was, and the
  engine never fabricates an entry: it shows exactly what its source
  returns, with every permission decision staying in the VFS behind the
  source under the composing process's own identity.
- **A listing may not be ready yet** (`Listing`, `Browser::resume`): a source
  that reads the directory on the calling thread answers `Listing::Ready`; one
  that reads it *elsewhere* — every interactive surface, whose loop must not
  stall on a slow disk — answers `Listing::Pending`, and the embedder asks again
  when its own wake says the answer has landed. Pending is never an error and an
  error is never retried by waiting. A pending navigation has moved **nothing**:
  `resume` commits the location, the entries, and exactly the history change the
  original gesture owed, all at once, so the transactional guarantee above is
  unchanged and a refusal that arrives late is reported in place.
  `Browser::is_listing` / `listing_target` are what a view draws its cue from.
  Nothing in the engine polls, waits, or sleeps.
- **The deferral policy is shared** (`ListingDesk<C: ListingClient>`): one
  request slot and one answer slot per named consumer, the staleness rule that
  drops an answer for somewhere the caller has since left, and the round-robin
  that stops one busy consumer starving another. It holds no lock, no thread,
  and no syscall, so every rule is a host test; the embedder supplies the
  exclusion and the blocking. Each program declares its consumers as a closed
  `ListingClient` set — the desktop session's icon column and trusted picker,
  the file manager's browser — so how many there are is a structural fact
  rather than a capacity.
- **Navigation history** (`Browser`): a bounded back /
  forward stack (`go_back` / `go_forward`, with `can_go_back` /
  `can_go_forward` supplying the enable state of the Back / Forward toolbar
  controls) and `navigate_to(components)`, the
  jump-to-an-arbitrary-location primitive (neither an ancestor nor a listed
  child — the file manager's "go to Trash" location uses it to reach
  `Library/Trash`). Every one of these is the same transactional, fail-closed
  navigation as descend / climb: the target is listed before any state or
  history changes, a fresh navigation clears the forward branch, and the
  history is a bounded ring that drops the oldest location rather than growing
  without bound.
- **Frame model** (`chrome`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM4b): the pure
  model behind the drawn toolbar, host-proven ahead
  of the chrome it drives. `ToolbarModel::for_browser` snapshots which
  `ToolbarCommand` is actionable — Back / Forward / Up reflect the navigation
  history and depth (`can_go_back` / `can_go_forward` / `!is_root`); Refresh,
  the view toggle, and sort are always available — plus the active view and
  sort so a tool renders disabled (never hidden) when it cannot apply.
  `ToolbarCommand::icon`
  gives each command its `lib/icon` glyph, and `apply_command(browser, cmd)`
  is the one shared, **read-only** dispatch (Back / Forward / Up / Refresh /
  view toggle / sort cycle over `ViewMode::toggled` and `SortMode::next`) both
  the toolbar click and its keyboard accelerator run through, so they cannot
  diverge and the read-only picker can drive the same toolbar.
  `ContextMenuModel::for_browser(browser, has_clipboard)` snapshots which
  `ContextCommand` the right-click menu offers is actionable: Open / Rename /
  Cut / Copy / Properties act on the selection (an empty directory offers
  none), Open With… is offered only for a regular file (a directory descends
  and a bundle launches itself, so neither has an application to choose), and
  Paste needs only the app's held clipboard — threaded in, since the clipboard
  lives in the app, not the browser. Each command's `label()` and
  keyboard-`shortcut()` caption drive its declared row, and `CONTEXT_COMMANDS`
  is the one top-to-bottom order the menu iterates. Only commands the file
  manager can carry out today are modelled, so none is speculative surface:
  New Folder is absent from `CONTEXT_COMMANDS` (it is a toolbar write tool) and
  lands with the stage that first wires its behaviour.
  `is_enabled` is **derived from** `reason`, so a row can never grey out with
  nothing to say — the reason is the text the seat shows as a tooltip when the
  pointer rests on the row, never a caption beside its label. **Nothing here draws a menu**: `context_menu(model, title)` declares
  the row model the desktop's own menu service renders
  (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md`), read back by `context_command_from_item`, whose
  one-based numbering is that declaration's exact inverse. The files app sends
  it on a secondary-button press and routes the one answer to the same verbs the
  toolbar and keyboard drive.
  The **Open With…** row carries both answers. Its submenu offers the
  highest-ranked candidates a plate can hold (`quick_applications`, bounded by
  `OPEN_WITH_QUICK_MAX`), each naming the bundle whose icon the desktop draws
  beside it. Its own click opens the complete list, which is *not* a menu:
  `open_with::OpenWithChooser` holds the candidates, a selection and a
  `ScrollColumn`, and the renderer's `draw_open_with_chooser` /
  `open_with_row_at` draw a list of `ListRow`s with Open and Cancel, sized to
  the candidates it holds, through one `ListView` the scrolling paths share:
  the wheel (`open_with_scroll_wheel`), the bar (`open_with_scroll_pointer`),
  and the keyboard's reveal (`open_with_reveal`). The list rests at any pixel,
  and a row its edge crosses is drawn whole, cut there, and pressed where it
  shows. A list, because the candidate set grows with the applications a user
  installs and no menu plate can promise to hold it.
- **In-place rename** (`rename`, `Browser::rename_selected`): the model of
  the file manager's first write operation (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM5),
  host-tested without a kernel. `validate_new_name` spells the typed name
  through the one shared `tairix_path::validate_file_name` rule and rejects a
  clash with an existing sibling or a no-op rename to the same name;
  `Browser::rename_selected` then applies it through an injected `fs_rename`
  seam and re-lists, transactional and fail-closed — validated before any
  syscall, a VFS refusal leaves the listing untouched, and the selection
  follows the entry to its new name. The engine adds no authority (the write
  is the caller's own permission-checked `fs_rename`, no new capability), so
  the read-only picker composes the same `Browser` and never calls it.
- **Activation** (`activate`, `Browser::activate_selected` /
  `activate_index`): the one dispatch-by-kind decision behind a double-click
  or `Enter` (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM6), so the file manager and the
  picker act identically. Exhaustive over the three kinds: a directory is
  *descended into* by the engine itself (its own fail-closed navigation); a
  bundle is named as `Activation::LaunchBundle` for the caller to launch
  through the ordinary signed app-load gate; a file is named as
  `Activation::OpenFile` for the caller to open in the associated viewer. A
  bundle is both a program and a directory, so the caller passes a
  `BundleIntent`: `Launch` runs it, `Browse` descends into it and returns
  `Descended` like any other directory — the caller names what the *gesture*
  meant, never the kind. The
  target's absolute path is spelled through the one shared `absolute_path`, so
  a launch or open can never name a different node than the browser shows, and
  a name that cannot be spelled fails closed. The engine holds no launch or
  open authority of its own — it decides *what* and *what should happen*, never
  performs the spawn or the `fs_open` (so the read-only picker never launches).
- **Double-click detection is not here.** The pairing rule a pointer
  double-click runs an `Activation` through (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM12)
  is `tairix_input`'s `DoubleClickTracker`, because its subjects are not only
  this engine's rows — the window manager pairs presses on a window's title
  bar with the same rule. A consumer imports it from `lib/input` and hands
  this engine the item the second press resolved to.
- **"Open With…" association** (`open_with`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM6b):
  the pure type→bundle model behind offering a file to a chosen application.
  A file's content type is the shared registry's (`media_for_name`), so the
  association vocabulary is exactly the one the drawn glyph comes from.
  `BundleSource` is the injected installed-bundle enumeration seam (the "Open
  With…" analogue of `DirectorySource`), and `applications_for` selects the
  `AppAssociation`s whose declared MIME set handles the file's type **or any
  broader type it is a subclass of** (`MediaType::parent`) — an editor
  declaring `text/plain` is offered for a `.rs` file. Candidates are ordered by
  how specifically they claim it (a bundle declaring `text/x-rust` before one
  declaring `text/plain`), and bundles claiming at the same level keep the
  source's enumeration order, so no existing ordering is disturbed. No match is
  an honest empty answer — a "no application" notice, never a fabricated
  default — and the type decision is a display hint only: the load gate still
  verifies and capability-checks whichever bundle the user picks. The engine
  never spawns. The renderer draws the candidate list as the scrolled
  `OpenWithChooser` panel above, so the files app can offer the full list —
  however long — where the default open picks the first.
  `association_from_appinfo(bundle_path, appinfo)` is the pure, fail-closed
  decode a running-system `BundleSource` uses per bundle: it reads a manifest's
  header and declared MIME table (the same body layout the loader reads) into an
  `AppAssociation`, skipping a corrupt or non-parsing manifest rather than
  offering it on a guess. It reads the declared types as a hint only and never
  verifies the signature — the signed load gate does that at launch.
- **Multi-selection** (`select`, `Browser` selection methods,
  `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7): the per-listing set of marked entries the
  management verbs act on. `Selection` models a plain click (`single`), a
  `Ctrl`-click (`toggle`), a `Shift`-click range (`range_to`, grown from the
  anchor), and Select All (`select_all`); `Browser::toggle_selection` /
  `extend_selection_to` / `select_all` / `clear_selection` bounds-check every
  index against the live listing. The selection is index-based, so any listing
  change (navigate, refresh, re-sort) collapses it to the single focused entry,
  and an unmodified keyboard move collapses it too — standard file-manager
  semantics.
- **Cut/copy clipboard** (`clipboard`, `Browser::clipboard`,
  `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7): the cross-directory set the move/copy verbs
  act on. `Browser::clipboard(op)` captures the selected entries' absolute
  component paths onto a `Clipboard` (`None` when nothing is selected), so it
  survives navigating to the paste target. `plan_paste(clipboard, target)`
  resolves each source to a destination in the target directory, **fail
  closed**: a target inside one of the moved items is `PasteError::WouldRecurse`
  (an exact component-prefix test — `/a/b` is within `/a`, `/ab` is not), and a
  paste back into an item's own directory is flagged
  (`PasteItem::overwrites_source`) for the app to confirm rather than silently
  clobber. The model names *what* would move where; the app performs the
  capability-checked `fs_rename` / streamed copy under the user's own identity,
  so composing it grants nothing and the read-only picker never builds a
  clipboard.
- **Paste execution** (`execute`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b): the pure
  model of *how* a planned paste is carried out, host-proven ahead of the app
  verbs. `paste_strategy(op, source, dest)` decides from the clipboard
  operation and the two items' `VolumeId`s (the 16-byte `fs_stat` volume id):
  a `Copy` streams, a `Cut` within one volume is a single `Rename`, a `Cut`
  across volumes is `CopyThenDelete` — the one `mv`/`st_dev` decision.
  `CopyCursor` walks a known-length source in fixed `COPY_CHUNK_LEN` steps,
  yielding the next `CopyChunk` to transfer; the app reads/writes it and
  reports the bytes carried with `advance`, so a large copy stays bounded and
  interruptible with no unbounded buffer and no spin, and it `resume`s from a
  persisted offset after a cancel or a preemption. It is fail closed:
  advancing (or resuming) past the source length is `CopyError::Overrun`,
  never a silent wrap. The engine does no I/O and the source is deleted only
  after a cross-volume copy fully succeeds — the app performs every syscall
  under the user's own identity, so the read-only picker never runs it.
- **Recursive copy** (`execute::CopyWalk`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b):
  the model of *how* a whole tree is copied — the copy-side analogue of
  `delete::DeleteWalk`. Where a delete removes contents before their container,
  a copy *creates* a destination directory *before* streaming its contents into
  it, so a child always has a parent to land in. `CopyWalk::from_items` starts
  the walk from resolved `(source, dest, is_directory)` items (the app supplies
  each item's kind, which the path-only clipboard does not carry) and is **fail
  closed** — an empty set or a source/dest naming the root yields no walk.
  `next_action` yields the next `CopyAction` — `MakeDir { dest }` (the app
  `fs_mkdir`s it and reports `created`), `List { source }` (the app reads it and
  reports its children with `expand`), or `CopyFile { source, dest }` (the app
  streams the bytes with a `CopyCursor` and reports `copied_file`). It does no
  I/O, keeps its own explicit stack (so a deep tree cannot overflow the call
  stack), stays within the shared `MAX_COPY_DEPTH` (a deeper tree is
  `CopyWalkError::TooDeep`, never descended without limit — the same
  `MAX_WALK_DEPTH` bound `DeleteWalk` obeys), and holds its exact position
  between steps so the app can cancel or be preempted without losing or
  repeating work. Driving it against the wrong step is
  `CopyWalkError::OutOfStep`, leaving the walk unchanged. `copied` is the honest
  rising count a progress indicator shows; the total is unknown until the reads
  reveal it, so no fabricated percentage. The app performs every syscall under
  the user's own identity, so composing it grants nothing and the read-only
  picker never runs it.
- **Delete** (`delete`, `Browser::plan_delete`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md`
  FM7b): the model of *what* a Delete removes, host-proven ahead of the app
  verb. `Browser::plan_delete()` captures the selection into a `DeletePlan`
  (`None` when nothing is selected) whose `DeleteTarget`s each carry the
  entry's absolute component path and whether it is directory-backed on disk
  — a directory *or* a bundle, so a sealed `<Name>.app` is removed with
  `UnlinkFlags::DIRECTORY` and recursed into as the directory it really is,
  while a regular file is a leaf. `DeletePlan::new` is **fail closed**: an
  empty selection, or any target naming the root (an empty component list),
  yields no plan rather than one that could remove nothing or the root.
  `len`/`has_directories` are the honest figures a delete confirmation reports. The
  model names the removals; the app performs each `fs_unlink` under the user's
  own identity (no new capability), so composing it grants nothing and the
  read-only picker never builds one.
- **Delete execution** (`delete::DeleteWalk`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b):
  the model of *how* a `DeletePlan` is carried out — the depth-first traversal
  that removes a directory's contents before the directory itself, the
  delete-side analogue of `execute::CopyCursor`. `DeleteWalk::from_plan` starts
  the walk; `next_action` yields the next `DeleteAction` — `List(path)` (the app
  reads that directory and reports its children with `expand`, so they are
  removed first) or `Remove { path, is_directory }` (the app unlinks the leaf or
  now-empty directory and reports it with `complete_removal`). It does no I/O,
  keeps its own explicit stack (so a deep tree cannot overflow the call stack),
  stays within `MAX_DELETE_DEPTH` (a fail-closed bound — a deeper tree is
  `DeleteError::TooDeep`, never descended without limit), and holds its exact
  position between steps so the app can cancel or be preempted without losing or
  repeating work. Driving it against the wrong step is `DeleteError::OutOfStep`,
  leaving the walk unchanged. `removed` is the honest rising count a progress
  indicator shows; the total is unknown until the reads reveal it, so no
  fabricated percentage. This is the browser engine's own component-path
  traversal, distinct from `rm`'s coreutils removal engine — two consumers with
  two data models, not one algorithm copied twice. The drawn verb is the
  renderer's `build_delete_dialog` (a `lib/controls` `Dialog` naming the honest
  target count and warning about folders, with the Action Warmth on the safe
  Cancel, never the destructive Delete), `delete_dialog_rect` (centred/clamped
  bounds), `draw_delete_dialog`, and the mirror `delete_dialog_action_at`
  hit-test resolving a press to the Delete or Cancel button (`DELETE_CONFIRM_INDEX`
  / `DELETE_CANCEL_INDEX`); the files app opens it on `Delete`, confirms with
  `Enter`/Delete and cancels with `Escape`/Cancel, then drives the `DeleteWalk`
  to completion over the user's own `fs_readdir`/`fs_unlink`. Only the write-capable
  file manager builds and drives it — the read-only picker never deletes.
- **Move to Trash** (`trash`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM10): the pure model
  of a *recoverable* delete — a delete is reversible when that costs nothing.
  `trash_strategy` decides, from the item's and the Trash directory's
  `VolumeId`s, whether the removal is a cheap `TrashStrategy::Move` (a single
  same-volume `fs_rename` into Trash, recoverable until emptied) or must fall
  back to the irreversible `TrashStrategy::Unlink` (a cross-volume removal — a
  rename cannot span volumes — the existing `DeleteWalk` path), reusing the same
  volume identity `execute::paste_strategy` compares. `trash_dest_path` resolves
  a collision-free home inside the Trash directory: the original leaf when free,
  otherwise the smallest ` (n)` disambiguation inserted before the extension
  (`notes (2).txt`), reusing the registry's one extension split. It is fail
  closed — it never overwrites an existing trashed item and refuses a root Trash
  dir (`RootTrash`), an invalid original name (`InvalidName`), a disambiguation
  past the per-name limit (`TooLong`), or a search past `MAX_TRASH_NAME_ATTEMPTS`
  (`NoFreeName`). It touches no filesystem and holds no authority (the app
  performs the `fs_stat`/`fs_rename` under the user's own identity), so the
  read-only picker never runs it. `trash_dir` spells the fixed `Library/Trash`
  subtree of the user's home — the one definition the app and its QEMU witness
  share so where a trashed item lands cannot drift. The confirmation dialog is
  disposition-aware: `DeleteDisposition` (threaded into `build_delete_dialog`)
  picks a safe, recoverable *Move to Trash* wording or the destructive *Delete
  Permanently* wording, so what the dialog promises always matches what the
  confirmed delete does (the app decides the disposition from the targets' and
  Trash's `VolumeId`s via `trash_strategy`, FM10b). `empty_trash_plan`
  (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM11) models the irreversible counterpart —
  emptying the Trash: it turns the Trash directory's listing into a
  `DeletePlan` over its *contents* (never the Trash directory itself), carried
  out by the same recursive `DeleteWalk` a permanent delete uses (§2.2), so
  emptying leaves the now-empty Trash folder in place. It returns `None` for an
  already-empty Trash (a no-op, not an error) and is fail closed: a root Trash
  dir (`RootTrash`) or an invalid child leaf (`InvalidName`) refuses the whole
  empty rather than remove outside Trash or silently skip an item. It touches
  no filesystem and holds no authority, so the read-only picker never builds one.
  The file manager wires both verbs through the manager-only toolbar tools
  (FM11b): `ManagerTool::Trash` navigates (`navigate_to`) to the user's Trash —
  the navigable Trash location — and `ManagerTool::EmptyTrash`, enabled only in
  a non-empty Trash (`ManagerToolModel`), builds the `empty_trash_plan`,
  confirms it with the `DeleteDisposition::Permanent` dialog, and drives its
  `DeleteWalk` through the same interleaved progress/cancel runner a delete uses.
- **New folder** (`mkdir`, `Browser::create_directory`,
  `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b): the model of creating a directory in the
  current listing, host-proven ahead of the New Folder tool. `validate_new_dir_name`
  spells the typed name through the one shared `tairix_path::validate_file_name`
  rule (the same rule the rename editor uses) and refuses a name already taken
  by a sibling (`MkdirError::Clash`) — both decided before any syscall.
  `Browser::create_directory` then spells the child path through the shared
  `spell_child`, applies the create through an injected `fs_mkdir` seam, and on
  success re-lists and follows the selection onto the new folder (ready for the
  app's inline rename); a VFS refusal leaves the listing exactly as it was and
  is surfaced as `MkdirError::Refused`. The create is the caller's own
  permission-checked `fs_mkdir` (no new capability), so the read-only picker
  composes the same `Browser` and never calls it. `suggest_new_dir_name`
  supplies the non-clashing placeholder name (`New Folder`, then `New Folder 2`,
  …) the manager creates with before opening the inline rename — bounded by the
  listing (pigeonhole), never an arbitrary cap.
- **Places / devices rail** (`places`, `layout::SidebarView`,
  `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md`): the shortcut column down the leading edge of a
  file-manager window — the user's own places above, every mounted volume
  below. `Places::new(home, volumes)` is **pure**: it takes the home
  directory's path components and the volumes the caller has already learned
  about and returns an ordered, validated, deduplicated list, so the model
  cannot open, stat, or list anything and is host-proven without a kernel.
  Reading the live mount table is the composing app's job — the file manager
  reads `MOUNT_LIST` through `lib/procinfo` and offers only mounts reporting
  themselves available, so a surprise-removed device is never drawn as a row
  that would fail on the first click.
  - **One fixed order**, so the rail never reshuffles between two paints of
    the same state: Home, Desktop, Documents, the application root, the system
    root — the fixed user places, offered whether or not their directories
    exist, since the model does no I/O and a shortcut that silently vanishes is
    less honest than one that says why it cannot open — then a drawn
    separation at `volume_start`, then the accepted volumes sorted stably by
    label. They are sorted *before* deduplication, so which row survives a
    duplicated target depends only on the set of volumes, never on the order
    the mount table happened to page them out in. An empty `home` drops the
    three home-derived rows rather than spelling a row that navigates nowhere.
  - **Fail closed on every offered volume.** A mount record is text this
    process did not author, so `Volume` is validated, never trusted: an empty
    label, one longer than `MAX_PLACE_LABEL`, or one carrying a control
    character is dropped; a target that is not absolute or does not parse into
    components is dropped; a target an already-accepted row (fixed or volume)
    covers is dropped. A malformed volume is never repaired, truncated, or
    guessed at into a row that would navigate somewhere else, and no stale
    volume row is ever fabricated.
  - **The medium is real data.** Each volume carries the storage medium its
    backing device actually reports (the mount record's `BlkDeviceClass`), and
    `tairix_icon::disk_icon` maps it to the shipped artwork — rotational,
    solid-state, and removable each draw their own drive icon, while a
    paravirtual or absent class draws the generic drive glyph. A USB stick can
    never masquerade as an internal disk, and nothing here classifies a device
    by its name or by guesswork.
  - **Below the toolbar, on the listing's row grid.** The command toolbar is
    *window* chrome: its band spans the full window width at the top, so it
    reaches the window's leading edge and aligns with the rest of the
    desktop's chrome. `sidebar_view` therefore insets the rail's top by the
    toolbar band, which puts the rail's first row top exactly at the path
    bar's top and every later row on the same `row_height` grid as the
    listing rows beside it — the rail reads as a navigation pane for the
    whole content region rather than a strip on a grid of its own.
  - **Geometry defined once** (`layout::SidebarView`): the rail's width is
    derived from the theme metrics and the theme's own body face — the padded
    row height plus the measured `WIDEST_FIXED_LABEL`, clamped to a third of
    the window — never a magic constant, so every fixed label fits at any UI
    density.
    `rail_rect`, `row_rect`, and `separator_rect` place the paint and
    `index_at` inverts exactly those rectangles, so the row drawn and the row a
    click resolves to can never disagree; a point outside the rail, on its bar,
    past the last row, or on the separation band resolves to nothing.
  - **A rail longer than the window scrolls** rather than dropping the rows
    past its end, so a machine with many volumes reaches every one. The rows
    are laid out unscrolled (`row_rect`, `separator_rect`) and shown through a
    `lib/controls` `ScrollView` (`view`); while `content_height` exceeds the
    rail, `bar_rect` carves a bar from its trailing edge and `rows_area` is
    what the rows keep. `shown_row_rect` is the part of a row the window shows
    and `index_at` takes a window point, so a row the edge cuts is hit on
    whatever part of it shows; `visible_range` names the rows that show from
    the offset alone, so the paint costs the rows it draws, not the rows the
    rail holds. The offset is the rail's own `ScrollColumn`
    (`Places::scroll`), moved by `render::sidebar_scroll_pointer` (the bar),
    `sidebar_scroll_wheel`, and `sidebar_reveal` (the least scroll that shows
    the cursor's row whole), each reporting the rows and the bar it moved.
  - **Drawn through the shared control.** Each row is a `lib/controls`
    `ListRow`, so it inherits the artwork seam (a volume shows its medium's
    shipped artwork and falls back to the built-in glyph) and every state the
    control offers is real: hover from the pointer, focus from the rail's own
    keyboard cursor while the rail holds the focus field, selected for the row
    matching the browser's current location (`index_of`, an **exact** component
    match — standing inside a subdirectory of a place highlights nothing rather
    than claiming the user is at the place itself), and disabled for a row
    `set_unavailable` marked after a navigation to it was actually refused,
    never a row assumed dead in advance.
  - **The interaction state lives on the model** (`cursor` / `move_cursor`,
    which clamps rather than wraps so a held arrow cannot cycle the rail
    endlessly; `is_focused` / `set_focused`; `hovered` / `set_hovered`;
    `scroll` / `scroll_mut`), so the paint, the hit-test, and the app's key
    routing all read one state. Where the pointer is belongs to the composing
    window, which hands it in; the model never guesses it. The volume rows are
    rebuilt when the kernel's mount notice says the table moved, or when the
    user asks the window to re-read what is there — never by a poll or a timer.
  - The trusted file picker passes no rail (`ManagerChrome::none`), and that
    emptiness is deliberate rather than unfinished: the picker's whole purpose
    is bounded to the directory tree the requesting application was authorised
    to be shown, so a rail offering one-click jumps to arbitrary mounted
    volumes would widen the pick beyond what was asked for. With no rail the
    window is laid out exactly as it is with no sidebar at all.
- **Item-view geometry** (`layout`): two views over one selection and one
  scroll offset — `ListView` (a column of full-width rows) and `GridView`
  (a wrapped grid of icon tiles) — behind the `ViewLayout` dispatch, the
  one definition of which items show for a given scroll offset, where each is
  laid out, and the point-to-index hit-test. The offset is in pixels along the
  scroll axis: the items are laid out unscrolled at their natural size and
  shown through a `lib/controls` `ScrollView` (`view(offset)`), so the view
  rests at any pixel and an item its edge crosses is drawn whole and cut
  there, never squeezed into what shows or skipped. `row_rect` / `cell_rect`
  are the unscrolled layout, `shown_rect` the part the window shows, and
  `index_at` resolves a window point through the view, so an item is hit on
  whatever part of it shows. Both clamp through the shared
  `scroll::ScrollRange` and share one `reveal` rule — the least scroll that
  shows the selection whole — so the renderer and the pointer hit-test can
  never disagree. `ViewMode` selects the view; toggling preserves the
  selection and re-reads nothing.
  A line holds only whole tiles (`cells_per_line`), because a tile cut across
  its line could never be scrolled whole. `GridFill` (`tairix_geometry`, whose
  `GridRun` is the one line arithmetic every grid shares) is the
  grid's policy for the space a line has left over, and it is a property of
  the *view*: a **resizable** grid takes `Spread`, sharing the leftover width
  out along the row so the gaps widen by equal amounts and the two end margins
  match — only the space between the tiles moves, a tile never stretches —
  while a **fixed** field, the desktop's icon column, takes `FixedPitch` and
  keeps one tile-plus-gap pitch from the edge its icons hug so an icon does
  not drift when the area's extent changes. The pitch is the floor under
  either policy, so a line that fits its tiles exactly is laid out
  identically, and the axis a grid *scrolls* along is never spread: the lines
  follow one another at their pitch, and the space past the last whole line
  shows the next one cut, one scroll from whole. A trailing desktop column is
  laid out in a frame as long as all its lines, and its view rests on the
  trailing edge at offset zero; the desktop never scrolls it.
- **Column formatting** (`format`): `format_size` (binary units — `1.5
  MiB`), `format_date` (`Time64` → an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, blank at the
  epoch so a stampless file is never given a fabricated date), and
  `format_datetime` (the properties view's `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
  date-and-time spelling, blank at the epoch for the same reason) — the
  file-listing convention shared by both views.
- **Properties** (`properties`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM8): the pure
  view model behind the Properties panel. `Properties::from_stat` turns an
  entry's name, its browser
  `EntryKind`, and the node's `fs_stat` `FileStat` into the display fields the
  panel shows — a human kind label (`Folder` / `File` / `Application`), the
  apparent and on-disk sizes (via `format_size`), the raw and octal mode, the
  ten-character permission string (the shared `tairix_abi::fs::mode_string`
  spelling, so it never disagrees with `ls -l`), the owning uid/gid, and the
  four `Time64` stamps rendered with `format_datetime` (blank when the backing
  keeps none — no fabricated wall time), the spelling a symbolic link stores,
  and the node's extended attributes (`Attributes`: `Unread` when the consumer
  never asked, `Unsupported` for a volume that stores none, `Refused` with the
  reason, or the `Visible` set — four distinct facts, never one empty list).
  It reads nothing and holds no authority: the app performs the one
  capability-checked `fs_stat` under the user's own identity and hands the
  result here, so the read-only picker builds the same view.
  `Browser::selected_target_path` is the shared spelling of the selected
  node's absolute path the `fs_stat` acts on. The closed `Field` vocabulary is
  the one definition of which facts the General section states and how each
  reads, so the display order, each label, each value, and which facts a given
  node shows cannot drift apart.
- **The Properties window.** The trusted picker shows no Properties. The file
  manager's is a **window** of its own
  (`render::draw_properties_window`, sized by `properties_window_extent`), so
  several nodes are inspected at once and the listing stays usable while they
  are: the client is the fields, the permission and ownership controls, and
  the extended-attribute list, with no second panel header inside a window
  that already has a title bar. A section taller than the body — the window
  may be dragged down to its declared floor — is laid out at its natural
  height and shown through it, with a bar beside it, cut at its edges: the
  wheel (`properties_scroll_wheel`), the bar (`properties_scroll_pointer`),
  and the keyboard's reveal of the row a cursor lands on
  (`properties_reveal`) move one `ScrollColumn` per window, and a section
  switch starts the new section at its top. `render::PropertiesFrame` is what it
  draws — `Reading` while the read is in flight, `Refused` with the reason, or
  `Ready` — because the read leaves the loop (one `fs_stat` plus one call per
  attribute key) and an empty summary would be a claim the reader cannot
  check. `render::properties_hit` is the one hit-test over the whole client,
  so the precedence between the controls is stated once: the capability-free
  permission toggles resolve before the privileged ownership control, and a
  press on nothing resolves to nothing.
- **Permission edit** (`mode_edit::set_mode`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md`
  FM8b): the model of committing a new permission mode to a named node,
  host-proven ahead of the drawn permission control. `validate_mode` fails
  closed on any bit above `tairix_abi::fs::FS_MODE_MASK` (the settable
  `rwx`/setuid/setgid/sticky word) — refused, never masked into a different
  mode, so the mode applied is exactly the one asked for. `set_mode` validates
  before any syscall and applies the change through an injected `fs_set_mode`
  seam; a VFS refusal leaves the node's mode unchanged and is surfaced as
  `ModeError::Refused`. The change is the caller's own permission-checked
  `fs_set_mode` (no new capability), so the read-only picker never calls it.
  The drawn control is the Permissions section, composed of the shared
  `lib/controls` form family with no layout arithmetic of its own: an
  **ACCESS** group — the mode as a `Reading` row over one `Owner`/`Group`/
  `Other` row per class, each slot a `FlagSet` of labelled `Read`/`Write`/
  `Execute` `Checkbox`es — over an **OWNERSHIP** group, stacked by the shared
  plate column (`tairix_controls::stack`). `render::PERMISSION_BITS` /
  `permission_cells` are the one definition of the nine owner/group/other
  `rwx` bits; the paint, `properties_hit` and `properties_permissions_key` all
  read one placement, so a press and a key reach the same toggle. The
  setuid/setgid/sticky bits stay in the octal/symbolic display and are edited
  via `chmod` — a deliberate scope boundary, and a toggle preserves them.
- **Ownership edit** (`owner_edit::set_owner`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md`
  FM8b): the model of committing a new owning user and/or group to a named
  node (the `chown(2)` / `chgrp(2)` shape), host-proven ahead of the drawn
  ownership control. Unlike rename, mode, and mkdir — the user's own
  per-inode-checked writes — reassigning the owner is a **privileged**
  operation: the kernel's secured VFS requires the dedicated `CAP_FS_CHOWN` to
  change the uid or set a group the caller is not a member of, and clears the
  set-*id* bits on any change. The engine models none of that policy — it
  names *what* to change via `OwnerChange` (each field `None` = unchanged,
  `Some(id)` = set), and `validate_owner` fails closed on a field set to the
  reserved `FS_OWNER_UNCHANGED` sentinel as an explicit target. `set_owner`
  validates before any syscall, maps `None` onto the sentinel, and applies
  through an injected `fs_set_owner` seam; a VFS refusal (including the
  missing-`CAP_FS_CHOWN` denial) leaves the ownership unchanged and surfaces
  as `OwnerError::Refused`. The drawn control is the Permissions section's
  ownership group: `render::OwnerField` and the `Owner` arm of
  `render::properties_hit` resolve a click to the uid or gid plate it edits,
  and `render::properties_owner_editor_rect` is the row slot the active
  `lib/controls` `TextField` takes. The plates are editable only where the
  launching user holds `CAP_FS_CHOWN` (read from the kernel-attested
  `self_origin`); a session without it is shown them refused, wearing the
  Authority Mark with the reason in the group's footnote, and resolves nothing
  on them.
- **Extended attributes** (`properties::Attribute`, `render::AttrAction`,
  `plans/ARXFS-METADATA.md`): the Properties window lists a node's visible
  extended attributes as selectable rows and applies a typed
  `key = value` line through `fs_attr_set` / `fs_attr_remove`. Keys are
  validated through the shared `tairix_fsmeta::attr::parse_assignment` grammar
  before the call, so a malformed or unknown-namespace key is refused in the
  app rather than by the kernel; the kernel still owns every authorisation
  (write permission on the node, a writable mount, the size bounds, the
  privileged namespaces). Values are opaque bytes shown through the shared
  `tairix_fsmeta::attr::display_value` escaping, so nothing a volume stored
  reaches a surface raw, and a value whose bytes a typed line could not
  reproduce is offered back by key alone. The rows scroll in pixels in the
  band above the `key = value` editor, which stays put; the cursor over them
  is the shared `RowList`.
- **Progress + cancel** (`progress`, `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7b): the
  pure display + cancel *state* of a long file operation the file manager
  drives interleaved with its event loop. `ProgressModel` carries the
  operation kind (`ProgressOp::Delete`/`Copy`/`Trash`), the honest rising count
  the driving walk reports (`DeleteWalk::removed` / `CopyWalk::copied` / the
  move-to-Trash item count), and a
  *latched* cancel; its `title`/`status_line` never fabricate a percentage,
  since the total is unknown until the walk's reads reveal it. The drawn
  surface is the renderer's `draw_progress_dialog` (a `lib/controls` `Panel`,
  an indeterminate `Progress` "working" trace captioned with the count, and a
  Cancel `Button`), with `progress_cancel_at` the mirror hit-test resolving a
  click to the drawn Cancel (fail closed off it). The model holds no authority
  and does no I/O, so the read-only picker (which never deletes or copies)
  never builds one. The delete, copy/paste, and move-to-Trash drives are all
  wired end to end in the files app, each reusing this one panel.
- **Renderer** (`render`): every entry point takes the desktop's
  `tairix_geometry::Scale` and the active `Theme`, and nothing takes a
  typeface: each resolves the body face the theme's own ladder names at that
  scale, so a caller cannot substitute a face the desktop does not draw with,
  and every chrome length — row pitch, tile size, toolbar strip, scrollbar
  gutter, panel and dialog bounds, menu placement — is authored logically and
  converted through that one scale, so the chrome tracks the display density
  the text does. `render_into` paints the current directory
  into a caller-owned `lib/raster` `Surface` in the browser's `ViewMode` — list
  entries as shared `lib/controls` `TableRow`s (name/size/modified columns),
  grid entries as shared `IconTile`s, each carrying the icon of its
  registry-classified type above the label and no plate of its own (only a
  hovered, selected, or focused entry paints a panel behind its icon) — so the
  file manager and the trusted picker render one coherent themed surface, the
  selected item carrying the shared selection state. Both views paint through
  their scrolled `ScrollView`, confined to the item area, so an item can never
  mark the chrome above it or the scrollbar gutter beside it whatever it draws
  inside its own rectangle.
  The caller owns that surface and holds it for the life of its window, so a
  repaint clipped to what one round changed (`Surface::with_clip`) leaves the
  pixels outside the clip standing; `entry_rect` and `item_area` name the
  rectangles such a round reports. `render_into`'s trailing
  `artwork: &mut dyn tairix_icon::IconArtwork` is the
  draw-site icon lookup: for each grid tile it is asked for the classified
  `IconKind` at exactly the side `IconTile::icon_side` reserves, and the tile
  blits what it returns or draws the built-in vector glyph when it returns
  `None` — so a missing, oversize, or refused asset degrades to a meaningful
  icon and can never blank the tile. A caller with no cache passes
  `tairix_icon::NoArtwork`; a list row carries the same classified kind in
  its name cell, drawn as the built-in glyph, so a folder and a file are told
  apart without the artwork lookup. `visible_range` is the one definition of
  which entry indices are on screen — dispatching on the view mode over the
  same list/grid geometry both painters use — so what a caller probes and what
  it draws cannot disagree. A vertical `lib/controls` `ScrollBar` is drawn in
  a reserved right-edge gutter over the same `ScrollRange`. `scroll_wheel`
  moves the listing by the wheel's scroll units through the browser's own bar
  — a fixed distance a detent, with what is short of a pixel carried to the
  next turn — and reports the bar and the items it slid; `scroll_pointer`
  routes the bar's own presses and drags and answers whether they repainted
  anything; `reveal_selection` scrolls the least that shows the selection
  whole; and `entry_index_at` is the shared item point hit-test. The in-place
  rename editor is drawn by `draw_rename_field` at the name's laid-out place,
  so it scrolls with its item and is cut with it, while `selection_name_rect`
  names the part that shows. Above the item view it draws
  the command toolbar (`chrome::TOOLBAR_COMMANDS` as a `lib/controls`
  `Toolbar` of themed `IconButton`s, disabled tools muted from the
  `ToolbarModel`); `toolbar_command_at` is that strip's hit-test, returning
  only an *enabled* command (fail closed). The toolbar band is the one piece
  of window chrome here, so `toolbar_bounds` and the three hit-tests that
  invert it (`toolbar_command_at`, `manager_tool_at`, `manager_tool_rect`)
  take the **whole window**, while `content_area` — the window less the rail —
  is what the item view, the scrollbar, and every overlay
  occupy. With no rail (the picker) `content_area` *is* the window, so that
  window is laid out exactly as it always was. Because a *write* action must never
  reach the read-only picker that shares this toolbar, the manager-only write
  tools live in a separate `chrome::ManagerTool` vocabulary (`MANAGER_TOOLS`,
  `ManagerTool::icon`): New Folder, the Trash location (go to the user's Trash),
  and Empty Trash (permanently remove the Trash's contents). A write-capable
  consumer hands `render` a `ManagerChrome`: its tools, a
  `chrome::ManagerToolModel` enable snapshot, and its places rail (the file
  manager passes `MANAGER_TOOLS`, a live model, and its `Places`; the picker
  passes `ManagerChrome::none()`), grouped into one value so a caller cannot
  draw a rail's rows while hit-testing a window that has none. The tools draw
  in their own toolbar group after the read-only commands, each rendered
  disabled (muted, never hidden) when the model reports it inactive — Empty
  Trash is offered only when the current directory is the user's non-empty
  Trash, a fact the file manager computes from `HOME` and threads in.
  `manager_tool_at` is their mirror
  hit-test, resolving only an *enabled* tool (fail closed), so the picker can
  neither draw nor resolve a write tool. `chrome_height` (the toolbar strip)
  is the one header offset the item views, the scrollbar
  gutter, and every hit-test share. `entry_rect` is
  `entry_index_at`'s inverse — the rectangle an item is drawn in, which is what
  a damage report names — and `selection_name_rect` is the narrower rectangle
  the selected item's **name** occupies, read from the drawn controls
  themselves (`TableRow::cell_text_rect` for a list row's name cell,
  `IconTile::label_rect` for a tile's label band) so the in-place rename editor
  sits on the name rather than over the icon and the columns beside it.
  `draw_properties_window` is the file manager's Properties
  surface, laid out from its own window's client: the metadata fields, the
  Permissions section's labelled `Read`/`Write`/`Execute` flags for each of
  `Owner`/`Group`/`Other`, the uid/gid values editable for a `CAP_FS_CHOWN`
  holder, and the extended-attribute list with its `key = value` editor —
  every one of them placed and hit-tested through the one shared layout.
  When the chrome carries a places rail, `render` paints the rail down the
  leading edge, below the window-wide toolbar band, and lays the listing out
  inside `content_area`: the list or grid and its scrollbar gutter are inset by
  the rail, and their hit-tests (`entry_index_at`, the scrollbar) resolve
  against that same inset area, while the toolbar's (`toolbar_command_at`,
  `manager_tool_at`) take the whole window it spans. `sidebar_index_at` is the
  rail's own mirror, through the rail's scroll. With no rail `content_area` is
  the viewport unchanged, so a window without one is pixel-for-pixel what it
  was before the rail existed. `WIN_WIDTH`/`WIN_HEIGHT` are the one
  browser-view geometry the files app, the picker, and the QEMU vertical's
  host-side assertions share; the files app opens its window `resizable` and
  re-maps this surface on a `WindowEvent::Resized`, laying the same renderer out
  to the new viewport.
- **Path spelling** (`vfs`): `absolute_path` (root-first components into
  a bounded, validated absolute path — each component checked by the shared
  `tairix_path::validate_file_name` rule, the same rule the rename editor
  spells a new name through, before any syscall) and `VfsDirectorySource`,
  the composition over an injected `fetch(path) -> stream` primitive so
  the engine is host-proven end to end without a kernel.

`no_std` (with `alloc`); depends only on `lib/abi`, `lib/path`,
`lib/geometry`, `lib/theme`, `lib/raster`, `lib/font`, `lib/controls`, and
`lib/icon` — never a kernel, driver, or window-manager crate. No `unsafe`.
