//! The cut / copy clipboard and its paste-target validation
//! (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM7`).
//!
//! Where the [`selection`](crate::select) is the *per-listing* set of marked
//! entries, the [`Clipboard`] is the *cross-directory* set the management verbs
//! act on: it captures the absolute paths of the items being moved or copied at
//! the moment of cut / copy, so it stays valid after the user navigates to the
//! directory they want to paste into. It is the one pure, host-provable model
//! behind Move / Copy / Paste — the engine names *what* would move where and
//! *why a paste is refused*; the app performs the capability-checked
//! `fs_rename` / streamed copy under the user's own identity in its own tail.
//! Composing this model grants nothing, so the read-only picker never builds a
//! clipboard.
//!
//! Paths are root-first component lists — the same
//! [`components`](crate::Browser::components) vocabulary the whole engine uses —
//! so the ancestor test that forbids pasting a directory into itself is an
//! exact component-prefix comparison, never a fragile string prefix (which
//! would confuse `/ab` with a child of `/a`).
//!
//! [`plan_paste`] is **fail closed**: a paste that would move an item into
//! itself or its own subtree returns a [`PasteError`] and nothing is planned. A
//! paste that would land an item back on its own current path is not refused —
//! it is flagged ([`PasteItem::overwrites_source`]) so the app can ask for
//! confirmation (or auto-rename a copy) rather than silently clobbering the
//! original.
