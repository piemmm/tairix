//! The places / devices sidebar model: the shortcut rail the file manager
//! draws down the left edge of its window.
//!
//! Two kinds of row share one list. The **user's own places** — Home, Desktop,
//! `UserFiles`, and the machine's application and system roots — are fixed: they
//! are always offered, in one order, because they are where a session's work
//! lives. The **volumes** are whatever is mounted right now, learned from the
//! live mount table and each carrying the storage medium it actually sits on
//! (`tairix_icon::disk_icon` turns that medium into the shipped drive artwork),
//! so a USB stick never masquerades as an internal disk.
//!
//! # Data in, no I/O
//!
//! [`Places::new`] is pure: the caller supplies the home directory's path
//! components and the volumes it has already learned about, and gets back an
//! ordered, validated, deduplicated list. Nothing here opens, stats, or lists
//! a directory — the model cannot be made to touch the filesystem, so it is
//! host-testable and can never smuggle an unchecked read past the app's own
//! capability-checked seam.
//!
//! # Fail closed on malformed input
//!
//! A volume arrives from the mount table, which reports what the machine has
//! mounted — including labels and targets this process did not author. A
//! volume whose target does not parse as an absolute path, whose label is
//! empty, over-long, or carries control characters, or which lands on a target
//! an earlier row already covers, is **dropped**. It is never guessed at,
//! repaired, or shown as a row that would navigate somewhere else.
