//! The in-place **rename** model: the pure, host-tested core of the file
//! manager's first write operation.
//!
//! Renaming an item is modelled here so every rule that decides whether a typed
//! name is acceptable — the spelling ([`tairix_path::validate_file_name`], the
//! *one* shared name rule), a no-op rename to the same name, and a clash with
//! an existing sibling — runs in `cargo test` with no kernel. The app supplies
//! only the `fs_rename` seam and the text editor; the decision of *whether* to
//! call the VFS, and *what* the two paths are, lives in
//! [`Browser::rename_selected`](crate::Browser::rename_selected).
//!
//! Authority is unchanged: the rename is an ordinary permission-checked VFS
//! call under the caller's own identity (no new capability), so the engine
//! adds nothing — the trusted picker composes the same [`Browser`](crate::Browser)
//! and simply never calls the write path. Validation is *spelling only*: a
//! name this module accepts may still be refused by the VFS (a permission
//! denial, a read-only mount, a lost race), which surfaces as
//! [`RenameError::Refused`] with the kernel's own [`Errno`].
