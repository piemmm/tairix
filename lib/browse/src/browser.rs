//! The filesystem-browser navigation model.
//!
//! A [`Browser`] holds the directory it is currently showing — an absolute
//! path and the entries the [`DirectorySource`] returned for it — plus a
//! selection cursor for keyboard navigation. It descends into a child
//! directory, climbs back to the parent, and re-reads the current directory,
//! taking the path policy and the permission decision from the source's
//! VFS rather than re-implementing them here.
//!
//! Every move is **transactional and fail-closed**: the
//! browser computes the new path, asks the source to list it, and only adopts
//! the new path *and* its entries if that read succeeds. A refused or failing
//! read leaves the browser exactly where it was.
