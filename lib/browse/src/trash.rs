//! The **move-to-Trash** model (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM10`): the pure,
//! host-provable core of a *recoverable* delete.
//!
//! A delete should be reversible when that costs nothing. Removing an item on
//! the same volume as the user's Trash directory is exactly that cheap case: a
//! single [`fs_rename`] moves the item into Trash intact, recoverable until the
//! user empties it, in place of an irreversible recursive `fs_unlink`. Only a
//! cross-volume removal (a rename cannot span volumes, exactly as `mv` decides
//! from `st_dev`) or the absence of a usable Trash forces the irreversible
//! unlink — the existing [`DeleteWalk`](crate::delete::DeleteWalk) path
//! (reused, not duplicated).
//!
//! This module is the pure decision behind that: it names *whether* an item can
//! be trashed cheaply and *where in Trash it lands* without clobbering anything
//! already there. It touches no filesystem and holds no authority — the
//! `files.app` `Run` binary performs the `fs_stat` / `fs_rename` / `fs_unlink`
//! under the user's own identity in its own capability-checked tail, so
//! composing this model grants nothing and the read-only picker never runs it.
//!
//! # Same volume, or unlink
//!
//! [`trash_strategy`] makes the move-vs-unlink decision from the item's and the
//! Trash directory's [`VolumeId`]s — the same 16-byte `fs_stat` volume identity
//! [`paste_strategy`](crate::execute::paste_strategy) compares, so the two
//! decisions share one definition of "can a single rename carry this".
//!
//! # A collision-free home in Trash
//!
//! Trash accumulates removed items, so a file named `notes.txt` may be deleted
//! while a previously-trashed `notes.txt` is still there. [`trash_dest_path`]
//! resolves a destination *inside* the Trash directory that no existing entry
//! carries: the original leaf when it is free, otherwise the smallest ` (n)`
//! disambiguation inserted before its ending (`notes (2).txt`,
//! `Logo (2),b60`, …). It never overwrites an existing trashed item (no silent
//! clobber) and is fail closed: it refuses a Trash directory that names the
//! root, an invalid original name, a disambiguation that would exceed the
//! per-name length limit, and a search that cannot find a free name within
//! [`MAX_TRASH_NAME_ATTEMPTS`].
//!
//! The ending is the one shared [`crate::media::Ending`], so the disambiguation
//! lands before the same extension and file type the content-type registry
//! classifies icons and "Open With…" associations by.
//!
//! # Emptying the Trash
//!
//! A trashed item stays recoverable until the user empties the Trash;
//! [`empty_trash_plan`] models that irreversible step. It turns the Trash
//! directory's listing into a [`DeletePlan`] over its contents — never over the
//! Trash directory itself — which the app carries out with the same recursive
//! [`DeleteWalk`](crate::delete::DeleteWalk) an ordinary permanent delete uses.
//! It is the inverse of the move above: the move is only offered because
//! emptying gives the user the way back to a permanent removal on their own
//! terms.
//!
