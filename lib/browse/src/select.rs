//! Multi-entry selection: the set of entries the user has marked in the
//! current listing (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM7`).
//!
//! The [`Browser`](crate::Browser) has always carried a single *focus* cursor —
//! the entry `Enter`, rename, and activate act on. A file manager also needs a
//! *set* of selected entries so the management verbs (cut / copy / delete) can
//! operate on many items at once. [`Selection`] is that set, modelled here as
//! the one pure, host-provable definition the file manager and the trusted
//! picker share — the picker composes the same [`Browser`](crate::Browser) and
//! simply never invokes the write verbs the selection feeds.
//!
//! The selection is **per-listing**: its members are indices into the entries
//! the browser is currently showing. Another directory's listing or a re-sort
//! collapses it to the single focused entry; a reload or a reported change
//! carries it across by entry ([`Selection::remap`]). Persisting a
//! *cross-directory* set of items for a move or copy is
//! the [`clipboard`](crate::clipboard)'s job, which captures absolute paths at
//! the moment of cut / copy and so survives navigating away.
//!
//! This module holds no authority and touches no filesystem: it is bookkeeping
//! over `usize` indices, bounds-checked by the browser against the live listing
//! before every mutation.
