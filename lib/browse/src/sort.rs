//! The one listing sort order the file manager and the trusted picker share.
//!
//! Both views drive the same [`Browser`](crate::Browser), so the order they
//! show a directory in must come from a single definition — otherwise the two
//! could disagree about which row a click lands on. [`sort_entries`] is that
//! definition: a pure, total, stable order over [`Entry`], parameterised by a
//! [`SortMode`] the app may toggle.
//!
//! The order is **directories first, then the chosen key**. Grouping folders
//! ahead of files (and bundles) is fixed regardless of direction — reversing
//! only reverses the order *within* each group — because a file manager that
//! scattered folders through a descending size list would be harder to scan,
//! not easier. Equal keys fall back to a deterministic case-insensitive name
//! order so the result never depends on the source's incidental ordering.
