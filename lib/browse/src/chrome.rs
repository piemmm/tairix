//! The file-manager frame *model* (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM4b`): toolbar
//! command state, derived purely from the shared [`Browser`].
//!
//! The model is what a surface asks "is Back enabled here?", so a drawn
//! toolbar and a pointer hit-test answer from one place rather than each
//! re-deriving it. The window itself carries the location — there is no path
//! bar.
//!
//! * [`ToolbarModel`] reports, from a [`Browser`], whether each
//!   [`ToolbarCommand`] is currently actionable and which view and sort are
//!   active — the enable/disable and pressed state the drawn toolbar paints.
//!   A tool whose action cannot apply renders *disabled*, never hidden, so the
//!   toolbar's shape is stable.
//! * [`ContextMenuModel`] reports, from a [`Browser`] and the app's held
//!   clipboard state, whether each [`ContextCommand`] the right-click menu
//!   offers is currently actionable, and why not when it is not
//!   ([`reason`](ContextMenuModel::reason)). [`context_menu`] turns that into
//!   the row model the desktop's own menu service renders
//!   (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md`), read back by [`context_choice_from_item`]; the
//!   file manager draws no menu pixel. Only commands the file manager can
//!   actually carry out today are modelled — Open
//!   ([`activate_selected`](crate::Browser::activate_selected)), Open With…
//!   (the [`open_with`](crate::open_with) chooser over a regular file), Pin to
//!   taskbar (the window channel's pin request over a bundle), Rename
//!   ([`prepare_rename`](crate::Browser::prepare_rename)), Cut/Copy
//!   ([`clipboard`](crate::Browser::clipboard)), Paste
//!   ([`plan_paste`](crate::clipboard::plan_paste)), New ▸
//!   ([`create_entry`](crate::Browser::create_entry)), Properties
//!   ([`Properties`](crate::properties::Properties)), and Delete
//!   ([`plan_delete`](crate::Browser::plan_delete)).
//!
//! The model decides *what is offered*; it performs no navigation or I/O
//! itself, so composing it grants nothing (the read-only picker builds the
//! same model and simply never invokes a write action).
