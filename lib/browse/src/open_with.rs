//! The "Open With…" type→bundle association model (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md`
//! `FM6b`).
//!
//! When the user asks to open a regular file with a chosen application, the
//! file manager offers the installed bundles whose signed `AppInfo` claims the
//! file's type. This module is the **pure model** behind that offer, host-proven
//! without a kernel exactly as the [`Activation`](crate::activate) decision is:
//!
//! * [`applications_for`] derives a file's content type from its filename
//!   extension through the shared content-type registry
//!   ([`media_for_name`]) — the one bridge from a
//!   name (all the VFS listing gives us) to the media-type vocabulary a bundle
//!   declares its associations in. Because that registry is also what the icon
//!   classifier draws from, the applications offered and the glyph shown can
//!   never drift apart. It is a display *hint*, never authority: it decides
//!   which applications are *offered*, and the load gate still verifies and
//!   capability-checks whichever one the user picks.
//! * [`applications_for`] selects the bundles that handle a file's type or any
//!   broader type it is a subclass of
//!   ([`MediaType::parent`](crate::media::MediaType::parent)), so a text editor
//!   declaring `text/plain` is offered for a `.rs` file while an application
//!   declaring `text/x-rust` is offered ahead of it. Bundles that declare the
//!   same type keep the source's order. No match is an **honest empty answer**
//!   — the caller shows a "no application" notice, never a crash and never a
//!   fabricated default.
//!
//! * [`OpenWithChooser`] is the surface the user picks on: the ranked
//!   candidates, a selection, and a scroll offset. It is deliberately **not** a
//!   menu — the set grows with the applications a user installs, so no menu
//!   plate can promise to hold it (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §6, decision 2).
//!
//! The engine holds no launch authority: it *names* the candidate bundles and
//! *what should happen*; spawning the chosen bundle through the signed load gate
//! stays in the file manager's own capability-checked tail under the user's
//! identity (so the read-only picker, which composes the same engine, never
//! launches). Deciding a file's type here never opens it.
