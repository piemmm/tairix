//! The directory-read seam the browser is built on.
//!
//! [`DirectorySource`] is the one thing the browser needs from the outside
//! world: the children of an absolute path. Keeping it a trait means the
//! navigation and rendering logic is exhaustively testable against an
//! in-memory tree without a kernel, exactly as `appmgr`'s `BundleStore` and
//! `ps`'s transport are injected seams.
//!
//! On a running system the source is backed by the VFS: a `list` call is a
//! capability-checked directory read, so the permission decision and the
//! path policy live in the VFS, not here. The browser shows exactly the
//! entries the source returns — it never fabricates a `/proc`/`/sys`-style
//! synthetic entry.
//!
//! # A listing may not be ready yet
//!
//! A source that reads the directory on the calling thread answers
//! [`Listing::Ready`] and is the simple case. A source that reads it
//! *elsewhere* — the desktop session, whose event loop must not stall on a
//! directory a slow disk is still walking — answers [`Listing::Pending`], and
//! the embedder asks again when its own wake says the answer has landed
//! (`Browser::resume`). Nothing here ever polls or waits: the trait reports
//! what it has, and the party that owns the wake decides when to ask again.
