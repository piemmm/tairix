//! The production, VFS-backed [`DirectorySource`] engine.
//!
//! [`VfsDirectorySource`] is what the shipping file-manager program wires
//! behind the [`Browser`](crate::Browser): it spells the browser's
//! root-first components into one bounded, validated absolute path, hands
//! that path to an injected *fetch* primitive (on a running system,
//! `tairix_rt::read_dir_all` — the kernel-authorised `fs_open` +
//! `fs_readdir` transfer under the caller's own attested identity), and maps
//! the returned packed `DirEntry` stream onto the browser's [`Entry`]
//! vocabulary through the shared `lib/abi` stream walker.
//!
//! Keeping the fetch injected keeps the whole engine host-provable: tests
//! drive a `Browser` end to end over an in-memory tree of *encoded* streams,
//! so every path-spelling, decode, and refusal branch runs in `cargo test`
//! with no kernel. The engine adds no authority of its own — every
//! permission decision stays kernel-side behind the fetch — and it fails
//! closed: a malformed component, an over-long path, or one bad stream
//! record refuses the whole listing rather than showing a partial or guessed
//! one.
