//! TAIRiX **shared directory-browser engine** (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW5).
//!
//! The one navigation **model** plus themed **renderer** every directory
//! browser in the system composes: the `files.app` bundle's windowed file
//! manager and the desktop session's **trusted file picker**
//! (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6) both drive exactly this engine, so the
//! two views can never diverge in navigation semantics, listing policy, or
//! look. Both are driven through an injected [`DirectorySource`]:
//!
//! * [`Browser`] holds the current directory's path and entries and a
//!   selection cursor. Descending, climbing to the parent, and refreshing
//!   are transactional and fail closed: the new directory is listed
//!   *before* any state changes, so a refused or failing read leaves the
//!   browser exactly where it was.
//! * [`render_into()`] paints the toolbar and the (scrolling) entry list into
//!   a caller-owned `lib/raster` [`Surface`](tairix_raster::Surface) using the
//!   active theme's palette and the shared `lib/font` face — the same surface
//!   the compositor places and rounds.
//!
//! # No `/proc`, no fabrication
//!
//! TAIRiX has no `/proc` and no `/sys`. The browser shows exactly the
//! entries its [`DirectorySource`] returns — it never injects a synthetic
//! entry — and it makes no permission decision of its own: the check and
//! the path policy live in the VFS behind the source, under the identity
//! of whichever process composes the engine (the files app's own, the
//! session's for the picker). A directory the caller may not read surfaces
//! a [`BrowseError`] rather than a partial or guessed listing.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! * [`entry`] — the [`Entry`]/[`EntryKind`] listing vocabulary, including
//!   the [`LinkTarget`] a symbolic link resolves to and the
//!   [`resolve_target`] rule a relative one is reached through.
//! * [`activate`](mod@activate) — the [`Activation`] dispatch-by-kind decision
//!   (descend / launch a bundle / open a file) the manager and picker share.
//! * [`chrome`](mod@chrome) — the file-manager frame model: the [`ToolbarModel`]
//!   command enable/pressed state, the [`ContextMenuModel`] right-click command
//!   enable state, and the manager-only [`ManagerTool`]
//!   write-tool vocabulary (with the [`ManagerToolModel`] enable state) the
//!   read-only picker never composes.
//! * [`select`](mod@select) — the [`Selection`] multi-entry set (single /
//!   toggle / range / select-all) the management verbs act on.
//! * [`clipboard`](mod@clipboard) — the cut/copy [`Clipboard`] and
//!   [`plan_paste`] paste-target validation (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM7).
//! * [`delete`](mod@delete) — the delete model: the [`DeletePlan`] naming what
//!   the Delete verb would remove, captured from the selection, and the
//!   [`DeleteWalk`] driven cursor that carries the recursive removal out
//!   depth-first, bounded and interruptible (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM7b`).
//! * [`execute`](mod@execute) — the pure paste-execution model: the
//!   [`paste_strategy`] move-vs-copy volume decision, the bounded, resumable
//!   [`CopyCursor`] streaming single-file copy, and the depth-first,
//!   depth-bounded [`CopyWalk`] recursive directory-copy cursor the management
//!   verbs run (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM7b`).
//! * [`media`](mod@media) — the one closed content-type [`MediaType`] registry
//!   the manager and picker share: it drives both the file-type
//!   [`IconKind`](tairix_icon::IconKind) glyph and the "Open With…" association
//!   vocabulary (a display hint, never authority), and names each type's
//!   broader type ([`MediaType::parent`]) so association matching can widen.
//! * [`open_with`](mod@open_with) — the type→bundle "Open With…" association
//!   model ([`applications_for`]) over the injected [`BundleSource`] seam,
//!   resolving a file's type through [`media`](mod@media) and matching along
//!   its subclass chain, most specific declaration first.
//! * [`sort`](mod@sort) — the [`SortMode`] and the one shared listing order.
//! * [`trash`](mod@trash) — the recoverable-delete model: the
//!   [`trash_strategy`] same-volume move-vs-unlink decision, the
//!   collision-safe [`trash_dest_path`] destination naming
//!   (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM10`), and the [`empty_trash_plan`]
//!   permanent empty-Trash model (`FM11`).
//! * [`error`] — [`BrowseError`], the fail-closed navigation outcomes.
//! * [`source`] — the [`DirectorySource`] seam.
//! * [`browser`] — the [`Browser`] navigation model.
//! * [`layout`](mod@layout) — the [`ListView`]/[`GridView`] item-view geometry
//!   and the [`ViewLayout`] dispatch (the one visible-window/item-rect/hit-test
//!   definition the renderer and the pointer hit-test share), plus [`ViewMode`],
//!   the [`GridFlow`] that also lays the desktop's trailing-edge icon column out
//!   of the very same grid, and the [`GridFill`](tairix_geometry::GridFill) policy that decides what a line
//!   does with the space it has left over.
//! * [`format`](mod@format) — the size/date column formatting and the
//!   properties view's date-and-time spelling.
//! * [`properties`](mod@properties) — the [`Properties`] view model: the
//!   display-ready summary of a node's `fs_stat` metadata the file manager's
//!   Properties panel shows (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM8).
//! * [`mkdir`](mod@mkdir) — the new-folder [`MkdirError`]/[`validate_new_dir_name`]
//!   model and the [`suggest_new_dir_name`] placeholder-name helper, committed
//!   through the `fs_mkdir` seam (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM7b`).
//! * [`mode_edit`](mod@mode_edit) — the [`ModeError`]/[`validate_mode`]
//!   permission-change model committed through the `fs_set_mode` seam
//!   (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM8b`).
//! * [`owner_edit`](mod@owner_edit) — the [`OwnerError`]/[`validate_owner`]
//!   ownership-change model ([`OwnerChange`]) committed through the privileged
//!   `fs_set_owner` seam (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM8b`).
//! * [`progress`](mod@progress) — the [`ProgressModel`] progress + latched-cancel
//!   state of a long delete/copy the file manager drives interleaved with its
//!   event loop (`plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` `FM7b`).
//! * [`places`](mod@places) — the places/devices rail model: the user's fixed
//!   shortcuts plus the mounted volumes, each carrying the storage medium it
//!   really sits on, validated and ordered without touching the filesystem.
//! * [`rename`](mod@rename) — the in-place [`RenameError`]/[`validate_new_name`]
//!   rename model the file manager's first write operation is built on.
//! * [`column`](mod@column) — the [`ScrollColumn`] every scrolling surface
//!   holds: its offset in pixels and the bar that draws it, moved by the wheel
//!   and the bar's own pointer routing through one definition.
//! * [`rowlist`](mod@rowlist) — the [`RowList`] cursor the *Open With…*
//!   chooser and the Properties window's attribute list share.
//! * [`render`](mod@render) — painting the current directory into a
//!   `Surface`.
//!
//! # Layering & safety
//!
//! `no_std` (with `alloc`); the only dependencies are the audited
//! `lib/abi` ABI crate and the shared `lib/*` desktop libraries, so this
//! engine never links a kernel, driver, or window-manager crate. No
//! `unsafe`, and no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths.
