//! TAIRiX shared pointer input-event vocabulary (`lib/input`).
//!
//! This crate owns the device-level pointer event types the desktop routes:
//! the [`PointerButton`]s it distinguishes and the [`InputEvent`]s a pointing
//! device reports (motion, press, release). They are pure data with no
//! window-manager or taskbar dependency.
//!
//! # Where it sits
//!
//! These types were defined inside `userland/gui/wm`, but the taskbar must
//! route the *same* pointer events to hit-test its regions, and a
//! `userland/gui/*` crate may not depend on the window manager nor on a
//! sibling userland crate. Per the shared
//! vocabulary therefore lives in `lib/*` — exactly the reasoning that placed
//! `Point`/`Rect` in [`tairix_geometry`] and the colour algebra in
//! `tairix_raster`. The window manager re-exports these types, so both the
//! compositor's [`InputRouter`] and the taskbar's input router consume one
//! definition.
//!
//! # Device events and the seat's own answers
//!
//! [`InputEvent`] is strictly what a *device* reported. Which surface a
//! pointer event belongs to is a different kind of fact: it is derived from
//! the window stack, which only the desktop's seat can see, and it is carried
//! by [`PointerFocus`] rather than smuggled into the device vocabulary. The
//! two together are the whole pointer contract every router here obeys —
//! a router acts on the events it is handed, and is told when the pointer
//! stops resting on it.
//!
//! Keyboard input is modelled alongside the pointer: a [`Key`] (a produced
//! character or a [`NamedKey`]) and the [`Modifiers`] held with it travel as
//! the [`InputEvent::KeyPressed`] / [`InputEvent::KeyReleased`] variants the
//! window manager delivers to the focused surface. This is the in-process
//! routing vocabulary; the bytes that cross the kernel boundary are
//! `tairix_abi`'s `KeyInput`, the same producer/consumer split as the pointer
//! ([`PointerButton`] vs `tairix_abi`'s `PointerButtonCode`).
//!
//! # Gestures composed from those events
//!
//! [`click`](mod@click) holds the one double-click rule: two presses of the
//! same button on the same *subject* within the desktop's published interval.
//! It lives beside the events rather than in any one surface because the
//! subjects differ but the rule does not — a listing row in the file manager,
//! an icon on the desktop, a window id on the window manager's title bars.

/// dragged across it, and a surface that acted on that position alone would

///
/// * **A surface acts on pointer input only while it holds the pointer.** The
///   seat delivers pointer events to that one surface's router and to no
///   other, so one press does one thing and it happens where the user was
///   looking.
/// * **A surface is told when it stops holding the pointer.** Hover is state a
///   surface *draws*, so it has to be dropped when the pointer goes — by
///   motion, by a window rising over it, or by a grab taking the pointer
///   elsewhere — or it is left stranded on screen with nothing under it.
