# tairix-input

Shared input-event vocabulary for the TAIRiX desktop (`lib/input`,
`AGENTS.md` §6 / §17.4 — `PLAN.md` Stage 7).

This crate owns the device-level input types the desktop routes:

- `PointerButton` — the primary / secondary / middle buttons the desktop
  distinguishes.
- `Modifiers` / `NamedKey` / `Key` — the keyboard vocabulary: the held
  modifier keys, the named non-character keys (Enter, the arrows, F1–F12, …),
  and a `Key` that is either a produced `Char` or a `NamedKey`.
- `ModifierState` / `ModifierKey` / `ModifierSide` — which modifier keys are
  held. The one definition every keyboard producer shares: each maps its own
  device's usage or keycode space to a `ModifierKey` + `ModifierSide` and feeds
  the edge here, so the left/right collapsing rule (releasing one shift key
  while the other is held is not a change) and the "did the visible set
  actually change?" test cannot differ between two drivers.
- `InputEvent` — what a device reports: the pointer's `PointerMoved`,
  `PointerPressed`, `PointerReleased` (button events act at the pointer's
  current position, which a router tracks from the motion events), the
  keyboard's `KeyPressed` / `KeyReleased`, delivered to the focused surface,
  and `ModifiersChanged` — a modifier key produces no character and is no
  `NamedKey`, so it reaches no surface as a key, but the state it leaves
  behind qualifies gestures that are not keys at all (a shift-click). The seat
  keeps the current set from these edges and stamps it onto what it routes.
- `PointerFocus` — the *derived* half: `Entered { at }` / `Left`, the
  enter/leave pair a seat hands to a surface's router. No device produces it;
  the seat resolves it from the window stack, which is the one fact a surface
  cannot see about itself. A surface acts on pointer input only while it holds
  the pointer, and is told when it stops holding it so the hover it is drawing
  goes away with the pointer rather than being stranded under whatever is now
  drawn over it. It is deliberately *not* an `InputEvent` variant: mixing a
  seat's conclusions into the device vocabulary would make every producer of
  device events look like it could reach a conclusion. It is a *message*, not
  state, and carries no `Default`: the seat is the one owner of which surface
  holds the pointer, and a surface keeping its own copy would be a second
  answer that could disagree.

## Gestures composed from those events

- **Double-click detection** (`click`, `DoubleClickTracker`,
  `plans/NEW-FILEMANAGER.md` FM12): the one pure rule that turns a stream of
  presses into single-click and double-click gestures.
  `register(now_ns, subject, button, interval)` pairs a press with the previous
  one only when it lands on the *same* subject with the *same* button within
  `interval` — the desktop's one double-click interval, which its session
  publishes in `DesktopInfo::double_click` — and the two buttons mean different
  gestures, so one press of each is two begun rather than one completed; a
  completed double consumes both presses (a third quick press starts a fresh
  single), a non-monotonic clock reading fails closed to a single, and `reset`
  breaks the pair when an intervening chrome press interrupts it.
- **Click runs** (`ClickRun`): the same pairing rule counted past two, for a
  text surface that selects a word on the second press and a line on the
  third. `register(…, most)` answers the press's place in the run and starts a
  fresh run past `most`; `DoubleClickTracker` is this with `most = 2`.
- The **subject** is an opaque `u64` the caller compares presses on: a listing
  row index in the file manager and the trusted picker, a window id on the
  window manager's title bars. It lives here rather than in any one of those
  surfaces because the subjects differ and the rule does not (§2.2).
- It holds no authority and does no I/O — the caller supplies the subject, the
  button, and the capability-free monotonic clock, and performs the action
  itself.

## Where it sits

These types were defined inside `userland/gui/wm`, but the taskbar must route
the **same** pointer events to hit-test its regions, and a `userland/gui/*`
crate may not depend on the window manager nor on a sibling userland crate
(`AGENTS.md` §17.4). Per §6 / §2.2 the shared vocabulary therefore lives in
`lib/*` — the same reasoning that placed `Point`/`Rect` in `lib/geometry` and
the colour algebra in `lib/raster`. It is `no_std`, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`,
and depends only on `lib/geometry` (a motion event names a screen `Point`). It
is depended on by the GUI crates, never the reverse — `Layer::Lib` in the
§17.4 layering.

Keyboard input is modelled alongside the pointer; this is the in-process
routing vocabulary, while the bytes that cross the kernel boundary are
`tairix_abi`'s `KeyInput` (the same producer/consumer split as `PointerButton`
vs `tairix_abi`'s `PointerButtonCode`).

## Stability

Tier: `experimental`.
