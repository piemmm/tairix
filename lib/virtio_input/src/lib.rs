//! TAIRiX virtio-input device logic (keyboard / pointer).
//!
//! The arch-neutral, transport-agnostic open/poll/decode engine for a
//! virtio-input device, implementing [`tairix_abi::driver::input::Input`]
//! on top of the cross-arch virtio transport from `lib/virtio`. As with
//! `virtio_blk` / `virtio_net`, the logic is bus-agnostic: the same
//! source drives the PCI and MMIO transports (the
//! queue protocol lives once, in the transport crate).
//!
//! It lives in `lib/*` so both the in-kernel `-M virt` input verticals
//! and the user-space input-driver process compose it without a
//! `drivers/*`→`drivers/*` dependency (the
//! virtio analogue of `lib/hid` ↔ `drivers/input/usb_kbd`). The thin
//! `drivers/input/virtio_input` crate keeps only the `register` entry
//! and the bind table built from [`VIRTIO_INPUT_DEVICE_ID`].
//!
//! # Wire protocol
//!
//! Virtio 1.1. A virtio-input device exposes two virtqueues —
//! the **eventq** (index 0), on which the device delivers
//! `struct virtio_input_event` records to the driver, and the
//! **statusq** (index 1), on which the driver returns status (LEDs,
//! force-feedback) to the device. This logic consumes the eventq
//! only; the statusq is optional and left unprogrammed (`abi-v1`
//! input reports events, it does not drive device feedback).
//!
//! Each event is the 8-byte little-endian record
//! `{ __le16 type; __le16 code; __le32 value; }` (virtio 1.1 §5.8.6).
//! The `type`/`code` namespaces are the Linux `evdev` ones, so the
//! decode below maps `EV_KEY` to [`InputEventKind::Key`] and `EV_REL`
//! pointer axes to [`InputEventKind::Pointer`], discarding the `EV_SYN`
//! frame markers and any namespace this `abi-v1` surface does not model.
//! A wheel reaches [`InputEventKind::Scroll`] in either of the two ways
//! devices report one — `REL_WHEEL` motion, or the `BTN_GEAR_*` presses
//! QEMU's HID pointers send — on the shared axis, which counts downward.
//!
//! No feature bits are negotiated: the only virtio-input feature
//! (`VIRTIO_INPUT_F_*` selects config-space reporting, which this
//! event-path logic does not use), so it accepts the empty
//! feature subset.
