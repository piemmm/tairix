//! Shared glyph-coverage engine (`lib/fontface`).
//!
//! This crate is the single home of TAIRiX's glyph rasterisation: it reads a
//! committed TrueType face ([`Face`]), walks its simple and composite glyph
//! outlines, and fills them into 4-bit (`0..=15`) coverage bitmaps with an
//! anti-aliased non-zero-winding rasteriser — **at any requested pixel size**.
//! [`FontFamily`] layers earliest-wins codepoint resolution over an ordered
//! set of faces on top, so a scalar maps to exactly one face's glyph. The
//! characters that exist to tile rather than to be read — Box Drawing and
//! Block Elements — come from [`lineart`] instead of from an outline, so a
//! border is whole pixels at any cell size.
//!
//! # Variable fonts
//!
//! A face may be an OpenType variable font. [`Face::parse_instance`] resolves
//! a set of [`AxisSetting`]s — a chosen weight, width, or optical size — into
//! a point in the face's design space, and every glyph is then instanced
//! against it: `fvar` axes ([`Face::axes`]), the `avar` axis remap, the full
//! `gvar` tuple variation store (with Interpolation of Untouched Points) for
//! outlines, and `HVAR` (or the varied phantom points) for advances. A
//! request at a face's defaults, and any static face, applies no variation and
//! rasterises byte-identically to an unvaried face.
//!
//! # Monospace and proportional
//!
//! [`Face::rasterise_glyph`] fills a fixed cell for a monospace grid, while
//! [`Face::rasterise_proportional`] returns a [`GlyphRaster`] tight to the
//! glyph's own ink with its left bearing, for laying out proportional text by
//! per-glyph [`Face::advance`].
//!
//! Two consumers share this one engine:
//!
//! * `cargo xtask font-atlas` rasterises every mapped scalar once, at the
//!   native [`ATLAS_EM_PX`] size, to emit the generated `lib/font` console
//!   atlas.
//! * the font service (`fontd`) rasterises a glyph on demand at the desktop's
//!   requested cell height and weight, so UI text is drawn from the outlines
//!   at its true size and weight instead of resampled from a fixed bitmap —
//!   crisp whether tiny or very large.
//!
//! # Outlines, for a consumer that is not drawing pixels
//!
//! [`Face::glyph_outline`] hands a glyph over as closed [`Contour`]s in font
//! units, quadratics intact. A resolution-independent consumer — `lib/svg`,
//! whose text is filled, stroked, clipped and transformed exactly as a
//! `<path>` is — cannot start from a coverage bitmap: that would fix a size
//! at decode time. It flattens the curves itself, at the accuracy the
//! placement it finally draws under actually needs.
//!
//! Both surfaces are the *same* walk over `glyf`, differing only in what they
//! do with each segment, so an outline cannot be decoded two ways. The
//! rasteriser flattens and maps to pixels as segments arrive and pays nothing
//! for the sharing.
//!
//! The engine is `no_std` + `alloc` (a rasterised glyph is a heap
//! `Vec<u8>` of coverage) and contains no `unsafe`. It fails closed: any
//! malformed or unsupported table — including a hostile variation store —
//! yields a [`FontError`] rather than a wrong glyph, an out-of-bounds read, or
//! a panic. One glyph's decode is bounded in outline points and in composite
//! component records, both charged across the whole walk rather than per
//! nesting level, so a composite cannot multiply its work by recursing.
//! Floating-point rounding uses the shared `tairix_util::mathf`, so it needs no
//! `std` libm and rounds exactly as every other rasteriser does.
