# tairix-fontface

Shared glyph-coverage engine: the one parser + anti-aliased non-zero-winding
rasteriser that turns a committed TrueType face into 4-bit coverage bitmaps
**at any requested pixel size**, plus the earliest-wins merged-family
codepoint resolution (`FontFamily`) that both the atlas generator and the
runtime font build on, and the pixel-exact `lineart` geometry for the
characters that exist to tile rather than to be read.

## Variable fonts

The engine instances OpenType **variable** fonts. `Face::parse_instance`
resolves a set of `AxisSetting`s (a chosen weight, width, or optical size)
into a point in the face's design space, and every glyph is instanced against
it:

- `fvar` — the declared variation axes, exposed via `Face::axes()`;
  `Face::is_variable()` reports whether a face varies.
- `avar` — version-1 segment maps applied to the normalised axis coordinate.
- `gvar` — the full tuple variation store for `glyf` outlines: shared and
  embedded peak tuples, intermediate regions, shared and private point
  numbers, packed x/y deltas, and **IUP** (Interpolation of Untouched Points)
  for the points a tuple does not touch. Composite-glyph component offsets and
  the four phantom points participate.
- `HVAR` — advance-width variation through an `ItemVariationStore` and a
  `DeltaSetIndexMap` (both formats, and the implicit no-map case). When a
  variable face carries no `HVAR`, the advance delta is derived from the
  glyph's varied phantom points instead.

Instancing at a face's defaults, and any static (non-variable) face, applies no
variation and rasterises byte-identically to an unvaried face — the generated
console atlas depends on that.

## Grid fitting

A face puts its stems and its x-height where the design wants them, which at a
text-console cell size is almost never a whole pixel: 1.2 pixels of stem
straddling two columns fills both at about 60%, and a screen of that is grey
haze rather than type. A face carrying TrueType hinting bytecode grid-fits
itself; the committed faces do not (`Inconsolata-EX` ships a stub `prep` and no
`fpgm`/`cvt`), so `gridfit` synthesises the fitting from the outline, the way
FreeType's autofitter does for the same reason.

The fit is a monotone piecewise-linear warp of one coordinate. Near-axis
segments cluster into edges (a stroke's two sides run opposite ways, so they
never merge into one), edges with ink between them pair into strokes, each
stroke snaps to a whole number of pixels — never fewer than one, so a hairline
darkens rather than disappears — and the rest of the outline interpolates. An
edge keeps the runs it covers rather than their span, because a side is often
several: an `m`'s top is the left stem's flat and two arch crowns, a `g`'s is
its bowl's crown and its ear, so the ink test has to be asked where both sides
really have material and not in the valley between them. An edge's segments
all land on its fitted row, so a slightly slanted side comes out straight
rather than overhanging the next pixel. A side that wanders just past the edge
cut-off is still fitted when the side facing it is an edge — the two sides of a
stroke are parallel, and judging them apart left a slanted bay of `#` half on
two columns — but never alone. Diagonals never register as an edge, so they
stay straight rather than becoming staircases, and monotonicity means a fitted
contour cannot fold over itself.

Rows also snap to the face's own alignment zones — baseline, x-height, cap
height, ascender, descender, read once at parse from the face's `x`, `o`, `H`,
`O`, `b`, `p`, `g` — so a line of text agrees on those rows instead of each
letter rounding alone. A round letter's overshoot is flattened onto its zone
only while it is worth less than a pixel, which is exactly when drawing it
would cost a whole row. A stroke with no zone of its own is centred where its
design falls between the zone rows, so `E`'s middle bar splits its counter as
drawn and lands on the rows of `H`'s crossbar; and a bar within 8% of the
face's standard thickness (its `H` crossbar, measured at parse) is drawn at the
standard's width, so bars drawn alike are drawn alike.

Columns are snapped only for a fixed cell, where the cell owns the advance and
moving a stem costs no spacing; the cell path also scales columns so the
face's uniform advance lands on a whole number of cells rather than rounding
to them — one for the face the grid was derived from, two for a full-width
fallback face lending glyphs to a half-width grid. A stroke there keeps its
design distance to the nearest stroke beside it, rounded as a whole, so a
`#`'s legs stay parallel and an `m`'s stems even, and every stroke is fitted
inside the cells the glyph occupies. Proportional text is fitted along rows
alone, because ink snapped sideways would drift out from under the unfitted
advance that laid the run out.

Measured on the console face at its 8×16 cell, the share of ink at full
coverage rises from 9% unfitted to 37%, against about 27% for FreeType's
autofitter on the same face and size.

## Line art

Box Drawing (U+2500–U+257F) and Block Elements (U+2580–U+259F) do not come
from an outline at all. They exist to tile — a border has to join its
neighbours into one unbroken rule and a filled block has to abut the next with
no seam — which a rasterised hairline manages only where it happens to land on
pixel boundaries. `lineart::coverage` draws them as whole pixels computed from
the cell instead, so they stay crisp at any cell size. A double rule is derived
as the outline of the region its arms sweep, so all twenty-nine junctions agree
without a per-glyph table.

## Monospace and proportional

- `Face::rasterise_glyph` fills a fixed `CellGeometry` cell for a monospace
  character grid.
- `Face::rasterise_proportional` returns a `GlyphRaster` tight to the glyph's
  own ink in x, with the integer left-bearing column, for laying proportional
  text out by per-glyph `Face::advance` (and `Face::line_gap`).

Two consumers share this engine, so the rasteriser is written once
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2):

- `cargo xtask font-atlas` rasterises every mapped scalar once, at the native
  `ATLAS_EM_PX`, to emit the generated `lib/font` console atlas.
- the font service (`fontd`) rasterises a glyph on demand at the desktop's
  requested cell height and weight, so UI text is drawn from the outlines at
  its true size — crisp whether tiny or very large — rather than resampled
  from a fixed bitmap.

A monospace family takes the cell path either way — the atlas by
construction, `fontd` because the family declares itself fixed-pitch — and
both substitute `lineart` for the two tiling ranges, so a border on the
framebuffer console and one in a terminal window are the same picture. Only a
proportional family is served tight to its ink.

## Outlines

`Face::glyph_outline` returns a glyph as closed `Contour`s in the face's own
font units, y up, with its quadratics intact. It exists for the consumer that
is not producing pixels: `lib/svg` fills, strokes, clips and transforms text
exactly as it does a `<path>`, and an `SvgImage` is resolution-independent, so
a glyph has to arrive as geometry. A coverage bitmap would fix a size at decode
time and put text on a second rasterisation path.

Curves are **not** flattened here. How finely a quadratic must be subdivided
depends on the scale it is finally drawn at, which only the caller knows —
`lib/svg` resolves its tolerance against each shape's own placement — so a
chord count chosen in this crate would facet an asset drawn large. The
rasteriser's own fixed eight chords are right for a bitmap cell and only for
one.

Nothing is pre-transformed either: the y-flip and the pixels-per-em scale are
left to the caller, because the two consumers place a glyph differently (the
rasteriser flips about a baseline row in a cell; `lib/svg` flips about the
baseline in user units). Contours fill by non-zero winding, the TrueType rule
— a counter is a contour wound against the one enclosing it.

Both surfaces are the **same** walk over `glyf`, differing only in what each
does with a segment, so an outline can never be decoded two ways
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2). Sharing costs the raster path nothing measurable:
rasterising D2Coding's 19,966 mapped glyphs takes 0.4641 s through the shared
walk against 0.4628 s before it, and the generated console atlas is
byte-identical.

`no_std` + `alloc`, no `unsafe`. Fails closed: any malformed or unsupported
table — including a hostile variation store — yields a `FontError` rather than
a wrong glyph, an out-of-bounds read, or a panic, and every count taken from
the file is bounded by the glyph's own point count. One glyph's decode is
additionally bounded in outline points and in composite component records,
both charged across the whole walk rather than per nesting level: a per-level
cap still multiplies with depth, so 65535 components each naming another such
composite would expand without end. Float rounding is `lib/util`'s `mathf`,
so it needs no `std` libm and rounds as the SVG decoder and rasteriser do.

## Stability

`experimental` — the API is settled around the in-tree consumers (the atlas
generator and `fontd`) but may change as installed-font support grows.
