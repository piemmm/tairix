# `tairix-appdata` — the app-data client

Stability tier: **experimental**.

The one way an application reaches its own settings (`plans/APPDATA.md` §3.9).
An app opens its store once, reads every setting out of the document it already
holds, and publishes the changes it made as one atomic commit.

```rust
let mut host = RtHost;
let mut settings = Settings::open(&mut host, "terminal");
let size = settings.u32("font.size")?.unwrap_or(14);
settings.set_u32("font.size", 16)?;
settings.commit()?;
```

## Five scopes

`Settings::open` is the application's **private** scope. `Settings::open_published`
is its **published** one — what it says about itself for other applications to
read through `read_published` — and the two are separate documents with separate
commits, because one atomic publish replaces one document.

`Vault` is the **sealed** scope: the application's secrets, encrypted at rest by
the service under a key derived per (account, application).

```rust
let mut vault = Vault::open(&mut host)?;      // one call, whatever it holds
let saved = vault.get("imap.password");       // local
vault.set("imap.password", typed)?;           // sealed before it returns
```

It differs from the other two in three ways, each the sealed scope's own: no
layer beneath it, because a secret an application did not write is not one it may
be made to believe; no staging and no commit, because the service seals each
write before it replies; and opening can **fail**, because "I could not read
your secrets" is not "you have none" — an application must report a damaged vault
rather than behave as though the user had never saved a password. A write ends by
re-reading, so the handle reflects what the service holds rather than a guess.
The plaintext is wiped when the handle goes out of scope, by the format engine
that owns the document's storage, and each read wipes the transport buffer it
was answered out of — the userland heap does not re-zero freed bytes, so a
buffer left holding a secret would hand it to the next allocation.

`blobs` and `temp` are the **bulk** scopes, and neither is a document: an index,
a cache, a queue, or a staged download is reached as a *descriptor*, so its
bytes never cross the app-data channel.

```rust
let handle = blobs::open(&mut host, "mail.index", BlobMode::ReadWrite)?;
let index = File::from_delegation(handle)?;   // an owned descriptor

let scratch = temp::create(&mut host)?;       // a fresh file, service-named
temp::release(&mut host, &scratch.name)?;     // done with it

let used = bulk_quota(&mut host)?;            // both scopes, one moment
```

They differ in who names the file. A blob is durable and the application names
it. `temp::create` takes no name and nothing *opens* a temporary file, so the
only way to hold one is to have just created it — freshness without coordination
is what a scratch file is for, and an application can never read scratch it did
not write in this process. Their lifetime is the boot. What a delegation conveys
is bounded: only the access asked for, and a byte-extent ceiling the kernel
enforces on a writable one, so direct access is not unbounded access.

## No app spells a path, and none names itself

Nothing here takes a store path or a user, and nothing but `read_published` takes
a bundle **identifier**: the app-data service derives all of those from the
identity the kernel attests for the calling task. So an application cannot reach
outside its own scope by construction rather than by a check some caller might
forget, and this library has no privileged surface to misuse. The one identifier a
caller does name selects a *published* document and nothing else.

The one argument `open` does take is the program's own command **word**, and it
selects nothing but layer 1 below — the app's own shipped defaults. A wrong
value there can only mislead an application about itself. `open_published` and
`Vault::open` take none, because neither of those scopes has a layer beneath it.

## Three layers, and which of them this library owns

Layering is the **private** scope's alone. A read answers from the highest layer
that sets the key:

1. `<Bundle>.app/DefaultSettings/settings.conf` — the defaults the bundle ships.
   **This library's layer**: it needs the *bundle's* path, and nothing attested
   gives the service one, while the app knows its own bundle with no lookup.
   Resolved through the one shared bundle-resolution order (`tairix_cmdres`), so
   an app's defaults and its `man` page can never come from different bundles.
2. `/System/Settings/<bundle-id>/settings.conf` — optional machine-wide
   administrator policy. The service's layer.
3. The user's own document — overrides only. The service's layer.

Layers 2 and 3 arrive already merged, as one document, in one call.

## One call to open; reads are local; writes are published once

`open` does the one round trip. Every read after it is a lookup in memory, so an
application that consults forty settings issues no further calls — where a
per-key protocol would have cost the service a file read and a parse *each*.

Every `set` is memory too, until `commit` stages the keys that changed and
publishes them as one atomic document replacement. A handle that is never
committed changes nothing on the volume. Two things a `set` deliberately does
**not** do:

- stage a value the effective layers already carry, so an app that saves a
  setting it did not change does not rewrite the user's document; and
- copy a policy or default value up into the user's file, which is what keeps
  that file holding only what the user actually chose.

A commit ends by re-reading the store, so the handle goes on reflecting what the
service actually holds — which matters after an `unset`, where the effective
value comes back from a layer below rather than from the value removed. A commit
answers whether its edits landed: one whose re-read then fails still succeeds,
and `store_refusal` says why the view is not fresh.

## Closed registries, and the open namespace that needs enumeration

Most applications read a **closed** registry: a fixed set of keys they know,
declared as a `tairix_appconf::Registry` and read through
`tairix_appconf::Lookup`, which `Settings` implements. `save`, `clear` and
`loaded` keep such a record in the private scope, and a settings surface stays
live while it is written through `Publication` and `publish`: edits write
nothing, a settle asks for one write off the loop, and the store's answer is
adopted wherever the user has not edited since. Some app data is an **open**
namespace, though — a catalog, a recent-file list, a set of per-host
preferences — and `Settings::settings` lists every key the layers effectively
carry, each once, with the value that wins. It costs no call: the client
already holds the document and parsed it, which is why the wire carries no
listing operation at all.

## No service, or no store: read the defaults, refuse the writes

`open` never fails. A store the service cannot serve — early boot before the
encrypted root is unlocked, a crashed service, a caller the kernel admitted from
no signed bundle — leaves the bundle's shipped defaults standing and records the
reason in `store_refusal`. The application therefore starts and behaves, can say
why its settings are the shipped ones, and is never told a change was saved that
was not: the commit reports the same typed error.

A `defaults_refusal` is reported separately, and only for a defaults document
that *exists* and could not be used — a packaging defect worth saying out loud.
A bundle that ships none is the ordinary case and reports nothing.

## One publisher, one operation

`Settings::replace` makes a scope say exactly the document handed in (stale keys
unset, every setting set, one commit), and `Settings::document` answers the
effective settings as one owned snapshot that outlives the handle. Together they
are what lets a program render its whole registry and publish it from a worker
thread, so a settings write never happens on the loop that owes a window a
frame (`AGENTS.md` §28).

## Whole documents, never fragments

A read declares the reply capacity the caller has. A document that does not fit
comes back as the byte count it needs and **no body at all**, and the client
asks again at exactly that length. So a caller never parses a truncated prefix
and never assembles a store out of two snapshots — every answer is one
point-in-time view. The retry count is bounded, so a service that keeps asking
for more is given up on rather than chased.

## Layering and testability

The crate is `no_std` (with `alloc`) and the engine performs no I/O: its three
syscalls sit behind the `AppDataHost` seam, so the layered read, the capacity
negotiation, staging, the commit, and the sealed scope are all exercised on the
host against a fake that speaks the *real* `appdata-v1` codec. `RtHost` (feature
`rt`) is the syscall-backed one.

The fake does not *encrypt* the sealed scope — the sealing is the service's,
behind its own tests. What it reproduces is everything a client can observe: one
document, no layers, no staging, a write applied before the reply, and a refusal
that is a refusal rather than an empty vault.

The `key = value` format is not defined here: it has one home, `lib/appconf`,
and this client applies the same validators the service does — so a `set` is
refused where the mistake was made rather than at commit time.
