//! The app-data client (`tairix-appdata`): how an application reaches its own
//! settings, and the only way it can.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut settings = Settings::open(&mut RtHost, OWN_WORD);
//! let size = settings.u32("font.size")?.unwrap_or(14);
//! settings.set_u32("font.size", 16)?;
//! settings.commit()?;                       // one atomic publish
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing here takes a store path or a user, and nothing but
//! [`read_published`] takes a bundle identifier: the app-data service derives
//! all of those from the identity the kernel attests for the calling task. So
//! an application cannot reach outside its own scope by construction rather
//! than by a check some caller might forget, and this library has no
//! privileged surface to misuse.
//!
//! A closed registry ([`tairix_appconf::Registry`]) is kept in the private
//! scope by [`save`], [`clear`] and [`loaded`], and a settings surface stays
//! responsive while it is written through [`Publication`] and [`publish()`].
//!
//! One entry point per scope: [`Settings::open`] for the **private** document,
//! [`Settings::open_published`] for what the application publishes about
//! itself and [`read_published`] for another application's, [`Vault`] for its
//! **sealed** secrets, and [`blobs`] and [`temp`] for the durable and per-boot
//! **bulk** scopes, which are descriptors rather than documents so their bytes
//! never cross the channel ([`bulk_quota`] reports both).
//!
//! Four contracts a caller depends on:
//!
//! - [`Settings::open`] costs the one round trip and never fails: a store the
//!   service cannot serve leaves the bundle's shipped defaults standing and
//!   [`Settings::store_refusal`] says why. [`Vault::open`] does fail, because
//!   "I could not read your secrets" is not "you have none".
//! - Every read after the open is a lookup in memory, and every
//!   [`Settings::set`] is memory too until [`Settings::commit`] publishes the
//!   changed keys as one atomic document replacement. A handle that is never
//!   committed changes nothing on the volume.
//! - A commit ends by re-reading the store, so the handle reflects what the
//!   service holds — which matters after a [`Settings::unset`], where the
//!   effective value comes back from a layer below.
//! - The sealed scope has no staging and no commit: the service seals each
//!   write before it replies.
//!
//! Only the private scope is layered, and layer 1 of it is **this library's**:
//! the bundle's own `DefaultSettings/settings.conf`, which needs a bundle path
//! nothing attested gives the service. That is the one thing
//! [`Settings::open`]'s command word selects. The machine-wide policy layer
//! and the user's own document arrive already merged, in one call.
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` (with `alloc`) and performs no I/O of its own: every
//! syscall sits behind the [`AppDataHost`] seam, so the whole client is
//! exercised on the host. The `rt` feature supplies the real seam.
//!
//! The scope walkthrough and the design behind it are
//! `docs/src/lib/appdata.md`.
