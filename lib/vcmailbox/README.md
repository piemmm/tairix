# tairix-vcmailbox

The single **BCM2711 `VideoCore` firmware mailbox property-channel client**
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2 — `plans/PI.md` P7/P7b).

On a Raspberry Pi the GPU firmware owns the display pipeline; the ARM side
talks to it over the mailbox property channel — a 16-byte-aligned buffer of
little-endian `u32` tag words posted through the doorbell registers. This
crate owns that protocol once:

- the **pure framing layer**: `FramebufferRequest::encode` /
  `decode_framebuffer_response` (allocate a scan-out surface) and
  `encode_display_size_query` / `decode_display_size_response` (probe the
  attached display's EDID-derived geometry; `0×0` means no display), and
  `encode_blank_screen` / `decode_blank_screen_response` (switch the
  firmware's display output off and on, the Raspberry Pi display service's
  power switch). `FIRMWARE_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPATIBLE` is the binding a
  firmware-allocated surface is published under, so the port that publishes
  it and the driver that binds it name it once. Every firmware answer is
  validated fail-closed — the firmware is an external input (`AGENTS.md`
  §5.4).
- the **bus ↔ ARM-physical translation** (`bus_to_arm_physical`,
  `arm_physical_to_bus`, `DEFAULT_BUS_ALIAS`) over the 30-bit `VideoCore`
  SDRAM aperture, failing closed on anything outside it.
- the **transport seam**: `MailboxTransport` with `MmioMailbox` as the metal
  doorbell implementation over two capability-gated `RegisterWindow`s, whose
  reply waits spin within a poll budget each (the pre-MMU boot path has no
  scheduler to park on), and `DmaMailbox` as the same over a carved property
  buffer it owns, which it withholds rather than frees while the firmware owes
  it a reply, and whose reply waits park on the inbox interrupt
  (`InboxInterrupt`) until a deadline of their own. QEMU
  does not model the firmware, so host tests drive the seam with a
  protocol-faithful mock and the doorbell is the on-metal acceptance item
  (`AGENTS.md` §2.1).
- the **firmware clocks and GPIO expander**: `query_clock_rate` /
  `set_clock_rate` over `FirmwareClock` (the ARM clock the frequency driver
  moves, the EMMC2 base clock the SD host divides), and `set_gpio_state` for
  the expander lines only the firmware drives (`FIRMWARE_GPIO_COMPATIBLE`;
  on a Pi 4 the SD card's power and I/O-voltage rails).
- the **real-time clock registers** (`RtcRegister`, `read_rtc_register` /
  `write_rtc_register`): the Pi 5's clock is inside the board's PMIC and is not
  memory-mapped, so the property channel is the only route to it
  (`plans/TIMESYNC.md` TS-4). Both directions require the per-tag response bit
  and check the register selector the firmware echoed, so a firmware that
  stamps success without processing the tag, or answers about a different
  register, is a fault rather than a plausible wall time.

## Why it lives in `lib/` (the §2.20 / §2.22 carve-out, legitimately)

This is single-device support — it knows the BCM2711 `VideoCore` — yet it
**stays** in `lib/*`, unlike the VL805 / BCM2711-PCIe device logic, which was
collapsed into its driver crate (`AGENTS.md` §2.22). The difference is the
second consumer: independent consumers speak this protocol — the aarch64
port's framebuffer boot console (`kernel/arch/aarch64`, P7b), the HVS display
driver (`drivers/display/rpi_hvs`, P7), the firmware framebuffer's display
service (`drivers/display/rpi_fb`, P7c), the VL805 firmware reload
(`drivers/bus/usb/vl805`, P10), the PMIC clock (`drivers/rtc/rpi`), and the
storage floor's SD-card bring-up (`kernel/arch/aarch64::sd_supply`, P8). The
boot console is a
**charter-legal non-driver** consumer (a genuine early-boot need, not a
removable scaffold), so the §2.20 carve-out applies and the shared definition
belongs in `lib/*` (`AGENTS.md` §2.22 / §6 / §2.2); a driver crate may not be
a kernel dependency (`AGENTS.md` §17.4). By contrast the VL805 / PCIe device
logic had only a `drivers/*` consumer (its illegitimate second consumer was a
removed in-kernel scaffold), so it has no `lib/*` home. This crate depends
only on `lib/abi` (the `DisplayFormat` / `RegisterWindow` / `DmaSlab` /
`DriverError` vocabulary).

## Stability tier

`experimental` — the Raspberry Pi bring-up firmware seam. It is `no_std`,
with no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths (`AGENTS.md` §2.9). Its
one `unsafe` block builds the window `DmaMailbox` holds over its own slab, and
the crate runs under `cargo xtask miri`.
