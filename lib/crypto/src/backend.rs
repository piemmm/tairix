//! The authoritative crypto backend-availability decision and the boot-time
//! cryptographic known-answer self-test (POST).
//!
//! TAIRiX ships **one generic image per architecture** compiled against a
//! conservative baseline (no `+aes`/`+sha2` build-time floor), and recovers
//! the acceleration a booted CPU actually offers at runtime from its single
//! authoritative feature detector (the Arch HAL `cpufeatures` slice, read from
//! `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1` / `CPUID` / `misa`). Every accelerated operation makes
//! that recovery through the one generic dispatch framework (`lib/cpuops`), and
//! crypto is no exception — with one absolute restriction the framework
//! enforces: **crypto is decided on availability only, never benchmarked**.
//! A "fastest AES" or "fastest SHA" benchmark would happily pick a table-driven
//! variant that leaks keys through cache timing, so the crypto family is always
//! [`Selection::ByPriority`] and the self-verify runs the real primitive against
//! fixed known answers, never a timing measurement.
//!
//! # What this module owns, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! The charter forbids hand-rolling cryptographic primitives: both the
//! "hardware" and "software" SHA-256 paths are the *same audited* `sha2` crate,
//! which selects its own compression backend internally, through
//! `cpufeatures`. That detection answers nothing on a target with no
//! operating system — every TAIRiX target, `x86_64` included — so there the
//! crate always runs its software path, and TAIRiX cannot override the
//! internal gate without transcribing the SHA-256 round function over
//! intrinsics itself, i.e. hand-rolling the primitive. Recovering hardware
//! SHA-256 therefore waits on a vetted, driveable audited backend
//! (`plans/OPEN-DEFECTS.md` D363), and until then this module records the
//! honest `Software` answer rather than a backend that does not run. Only a
//! hosted `x86_64` build — the crate's own host tests — offers the hardware
//! candidate, because only there does the crate's detection run.
//!
//! So this module does **not** fork the crypto computation (that lives inside
//! the audited crate). What it owns is the part TAIRiX must own to be *better*
//! than a scatter of per-crate ad-hoc detection:
//!
//! 1. **One authoritative availability decision.** Which backend is active is
//!    derived from TAIRiX's single feature detector — not each crate's private,
//!    bare-metal-broken detection — and expressed through the uniform
//!    `lib/cpuops` registry so it is observable and consistent with every other
//!    accelerated family.
//! 2. **A mandatory boot-time known-answer self-test (POST).** The framework's
//!    self-verify *is* the self-test: before the availability decision is
//!    trusted, the live SHA-256 path is run over FIPS 180-4 §A.1 vectors and
//!    compared to their published digests. A crypto core that computes a wrong
//!    answer cannot be reported as working — it drives a fatal boot halt in the
//!    kernel, exactly as a FIPS power-on self-test failure renders the module
//!    inoperable rather than letting it run with broken crypto.
//! 3. **An audit record.** The kernel records the typed [`Decision`] this
//!    returns, so the active crypto backend for the boot is on the audit log.
//!
//! The result is never a panic and never a benchmark; a target with no
//! runtime-selected hardware path resolves to the audited constant-time
//! software backend, which is a real, correct primitive and always the last
//! resort (fail closed).
