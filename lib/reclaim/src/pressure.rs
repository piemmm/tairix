//! VM pressure bands and cache reclaim ordering (`plans/SMARTRAM.md`
//! SMART2, `plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md` section 6).
//!
//! This module is the one definition of the system's memory-pressure
//! state and of the order reclaimable caches are shrunk in as pressure
//! rises. The band vocabulary (normal, mild, moderate, severe,
//! critical) is shared with `plans/SWAPSWAPSWAP.md`; there is no
//! parallel vocabulary and no second pressure model. The `ramzip`
//! handoff and VM escalation ordering, which need the kernel's own
//! anonymous-memory tier, live beside it in `kernel/mem::pressure` and
//! consume the band defined here.
//!
//! # Three gauges, one band
//!
//! [`PressureGauge`] is the interface every cache consults, with one
//! implementation per vantage point:
//!
//! - [`MemoryPressure`] — the kernel's *measuring* gauge. It samples a
//!   [`FreeMemorySource`] (in production the physical frame allocator,
//!   whose free-frame count is the authoritative "how much RAM is
//!   left" figure) and folds the reading into a banded state machine
//!   with hysteresis: each band is entered below one watermark and left
//!   above a strictly higher one, so a reading that hovers on a single
//!   threshold cannot oscillate the band. Sampling happens on the
//!   caller's own operations (a cache consults the gauge as it works);
//!   there is no background worker and no periodic tick.
//! - [`ReportedPressure`] — a *receiving* gauge for a process that
//!   cannot see physical memory at all. It holds the band the kernel
//!   last reported and answers from that, so a userland cache obeys
//!   exactly the same policy as a kernel one without inventing a second
//!   notion of pressure. Until the first report arrives it answers
//!   critical: an unknown band admits nothing.
//! - [`Unpressured`] — a *fixed* gauge reading normal, for a drawing that
//!   must not depend on the machine it was drawn on.
//!
//! # Reclaim ordering
//!
//! [`shrink_target`] maps a band and a [`ReclaimClass`] to the byte
//! ceiling that class must shrink to, following `plans/SMARTRAM.md`
//! section 7: disposable and speculative classes drop at mild
//! pressure, clean file data begins reclaim at mild and finishes at
//! moderate together with transform cache, metadata and recovery
//! assist are preserved longest, and at severe or critical pressure
//! every class obeys a forced shrink to zero. A cache whose entries
//! cannot be rebuilt without the filesystem or another process declares
//! a working-set floor ([`CacheBudget::with_working_set_floor`]) that
//! mild and moderate leave alone, and a rasterised-UI cache additionally
//! declares the irreducible reserve
//! ([`CacheBudget::with_reserved_floor`]) that no band takes, because a
//! desktop with none of its pixels left re-derives every one of them per
//! repaint instead of drawing a cheaper frame.
//!
//! Growth reads that same [`shrink_target`], so a class the band
//! preserves keeps admitting and one the band empties admits nothing.
//! Two policies would eventually disagree, and the disagreement is
//! invisible: a cache that may keep three quarters of its entries but
//! admit none of them decays to uselessness while reporting a healthy
//! ledger.
//!
//! # Reserves
//!
//! The thresholds carry a reserve floor derived from the backing size.
//! A reading at or below the reserve is critical pressure regardless
//! of band history, and the [`GrowthAllowance`] one reading yields
//! refuses any cache growth that would dip into the reserve or exceed
//! the band's own ceiling for the growing cache's class — cache
//! expansion can never be the cause of reserve exhaustion, and a
//! caller admitting a whole run of entries draws each one down from
//! that single allowance rather than re-asking per entry. A backing
//! whose size is unknown (zero) reports critical pressure and admits
//! nothing: fail closed, never a guess.
