//! The one desktop-session disposable-UI cache policy (`plans/SMARTRAM.md`
//! section 6.4).
//!
//! A scale/theme-rasterised pointer cursor and a rasterised notification
//! glyph are the same kind of memory from the reclaim model's point of
//! view: cheap to lose, expensive to rebuild, owned by the seat that is
//! showing them, and invalidated wholesale the moment the scale, theme, or
//! source set changes. [`disposable_ui_candidate`] is the one declaration
//! of that classification, and [`disposable_ui_cache`] is the one place a
//! [`ReclaimCache`] is assembled from it, so the window manager's cursor
//! cache and the taskbar's icon cache — which may not depend on each
//! other — never carry two copies of the same six declared dimensions.
//!
//! # Why this lives here and not in the desktop session
//!
//! The natural first guess is that this is desktop-session policy and
//! belongs in `userland/gui/session`. It cannot. The window manager and
//! the taskbar each need to *name* the type of cache they hold and to
//! offer their embedder a way to build one, and neither may depend on the
//! session — the session composes them, and the reverse edge is
//! forbidden. They may not depend on each other either. `lib/reclaim` is
//! the only crate both already depend on and that sits below every
//! `userland/gui/*` crate, so it is the sole layering-legal home for the
//! one shared definition.
//!
//! This is not new policy leaking into the generic model:
//! [`ReclaimClass::DisposableUi`] and [`ReclaimOwner::DesktopSession`]
//! are already part of the closed taxonomy `model` defines, and this
//! module only composes them into the one declaration both consumers
//! would otherwise each spell out.
//!
//! # Every one of them keeps a reserve
//!
//! Every constructor declares
//! [`UI_CACHE_RESERVE_BYTES`] irreducible,
//! clamped by each cache's own derived ceiling. They differ in how much they
//! hold above that — a cursor fraction for pixels a rasterise rebuilds, a
//! screenful for the bulkier kinds bounded by what can be seen, the machine's
//! share for glass stacked deeper than that — and in which bands take it;
//! none of them is ever emptied outright, because
//! a session with no rasterised
//! pixels left redraws the same screen through a filesystem read, a
//! sandbox round trip, or an IPC call per element, every repaint.
//!
//! # One constructor, injected
//!
//! There is exactly one way to build such a cache, and it demands the
//! real backing size, the real gauge, and the real audit sink. There is
//! deliberately no parameterless fallback: a cache built without a live
//! gauge would classify and serve correctly while retaining nothing, and
//! a desktop that silently rasterised every cursor afresh — with the
//! diagnostics that would reveal it discarded — is a defect that looks
//! exactly like working software. A consumer therefore takes its cache as
//! a constructor argument, and the session that knows the display size,
//! the seat, and the process gauge assembles it.
