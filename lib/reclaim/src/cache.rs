//! The one bounded, classified, pressure-governed cache
//! (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` sections 5 and 7).
//!
//! Every reclaimable cache in TAIRiX owes the same obligations: it is
//! classified through the [`classification gate`](crate::CacheCandidate::classify)
//! before it holds a single byte, it is bounded by a
//! [`CacheBudget`] derived from its backing rather than a hand-picked
//! ceiling, it shrinks to the [`shrink_target`] its class and the live
//! [`PressureGauge`] band dictate, it charges every entry to a
//! [`CacheAccounting`] ledger with checked arithmetic, it invalidates
//! precisely on a generation change, it wipes anything that was not
//! public before releasing it, and it fails closed — poisoning itself
//! and serving uncached — the moment its books stop balancing.
//!
//! [`ReclaimCache`] is that obligation, implemented once. A consumer
//! supplies only what is genuinely its own: the key it looks up by, the
//! value it retains, the generation that invalidates the lot, and how
//! to build a value on a miss.
//!
//! # Generations
//!
//! A *generation* is whatever the consumer decides invalidates every
//! entry at once — the active display scale combined with the active
//! theme, a mount generation, a policy epoch.
//! [`get_or_build`](ReclaimCache::get_or_build) drops the whole cache
//! the moment the generation differs from the one the entries were
//! built at, so a stale entry cannot be served: this is the
//! [`InvalidationSource::GenerationToken`](crate::InvalidationSource::GenerationToken)
//! contract, not a best-effort sweep.
//!
//! # Never required for correctness
//!
//! A reclaimable cache is an accelerator. Every refusal path here — a
//! poisoned cache, a band that forbids growth, a value larger than the
//! whole budget, a ledger that would overflow — still hands the caller
//! the value it asked for, as [`Served::Uncached`]. The caller never
//! has to decide what to do when caching is unavailable, and no path
//! renders twice.
//!
//! # Hot path
//!
//! A hit is one generation comparison, one gauge sample, one hash probe, and
//! one three-link splice — expected constant time, never a linear scan of the
//! entries and never the O(log n) a recency index keyed by a tick would cost.
//! Eviction takes the entry at the cold end of that same order, so a forced
//! shrink visits only what it actually releases.
