//! Keeping a process's memory-pressure band current
//! (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` SMART5, `plans/NOTICE.md`).
//!
//! A process that holds reclaimable memory sizes that memory against the band
//! the kernel publishes, and has no way to measure free memory itself. It
//! learns the band through the `MemoryPressure` system notice: the
//! edge-triggered `WaitSourceKind::SystemNotice` member says the band moved,
//! and `notice_read` answers with the depth it moved to.
//!
//! Arm the wake, read the band, publish it — the same three steps in every
//! program that caches anything, so they live here once rather than being
//! re-spelled per program. `lib/rt` owns the gauge itself and deliberately
//! does not fetch it (choosing what to do about a band is not the runtime's
//! business).
//!
//! # The read is a syscall, not a service call
//!
//! The band arrives from the kernel directly. It has to: the wake lands on the
//! loop that owes the user a frame, and an IPC round trip to the System
//! Information service there is exactly the blocking I/O an interactive
//! surface may not perform. The gated
//! [`crate::kstats::memory_pressure_band`] query remains what a *monitor*
//! reads to display the band; a cache holder converges on the notice.
//!
//! # A gauge nobody reports to admits nothing
//!
//! [`ReportedPressure`](tairix_reclaim::ReportedPressure) starts at [`PressureBand::Critical`] so a process that
//! never learns the band cannot grow a cache on a machine that may be
//! starving. That default is only safe while it is *transient*: a program that
//! never arms the wake leaves every cache in the process permanently unable to
//! retain anything, turning each cached value into a fresh rebuild — for a
//! glyph, a whole IPC round trip per character drawn. Any program with an
//! event loop and a cache calls `watch` once and `refresh` on the wake.
