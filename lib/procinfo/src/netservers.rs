//! The shared walks over the network-supplied server sets the host holds:
//! the recursive resolvers, and the network time servers.
//!
//! TAIRiX has no `/etc/resolv.conf` and no `/etc/ntp.conf`: each set is read
//! through a typed, versioned, capability-checked `sysinfo-v1` query served
//! by `sysinfod` (which forwards to `netstack`'s broker read). Both sets are
//! aggregated and deduplicated across every managed interface by the stack,
//! and both are the one source their reader and their client share — so the
//! two can never disagree. The paging loop is the generic
//! [`walk_pages`](crate::list) the socket and mount walks use, so only the
//! per-record decode lives here, once for both sets.
