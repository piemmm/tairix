//! The userspace `info:`/`state:`/`stats:` resource resolver
//! (`plans/ALIAS.md` §6.2, §6.3, §6.4, §14).
//!
//! `info:`, `state:`, and `stats:` references are **not** kernel-owned resources: they
//! name facts and measurements that must be served by the System Information
//! API, never by a virtual file, by text scraping, or by a kernel
//! `resource_open` backing (which would bypass the `sysinfod` broker's
//! per-principal scoping). This resolver is therefore userspace: it maps a
//! parsed [`ResourceRef`] onto a [`SysinfoQueryId`], issues it through the
//! shared [`Transport`] seam (the same path `ps`/`sysinfo` use), and turns
//! the typed reply into a [`ResourceResponse`] (`crate::resinfo`).
//!
//! It fails closed: an unknown selector, a decoration (`@guard`, `::facet`,
//! `?param`) on a resource that takes none, a capability the caller does not
//! hold, or a reply that does not decode all yield a typed [`ResolveInfoError`]
//! and never a fabricated value. The served set grows in place here as sibling
//! queries land; today it covers exactly the ungated/self-scoped and
//! kernel-memory `sysinfo-v1` queries that already exist
//! (`info:system/{hostname,kernel,machine-id,boot-time}`,
//! `info:process/{pid,uid,gid,proc-id,trust-domain,caps}`,
//! `info:mem/{physical,page-size}`, `info:limits/<kind>/{soft,hard}`,
//! `stats:uptime`, `stats:mem/*`, and `stats:limits/<kind>`) plus the
//! network-interface queries `netstack` answers through the broker
//! (`info:net/<iface>/{mac,mtu,kind}`, `state:net/<iface>/{link,address}`, and
//! `stats:net/<iface>/{rx,tx}.{packets,bytes,dropped}`, the windowed throughput
//! rates `stats:net/<iface>/{rx,tx}.{pps,bps}?window=…`, plus the stack-wide
//! `stats:net/stack/…` defence counters — the packet-path aggregates
//! `{icmp-errors,icmp-suppressed,reassembly-evicted}` summed across interfaces,
//! and the TCP connection-defence totals
//! `{syn-cookies,syn-cookies-accepted,syn-cookies-rejected, syn-backlog-started,syn-backlog-expired,accepts,accept-overflow, tcp-resets}`
//! read from the stack's one socket table, `plans/NETWORK.md` §5).
//!
//! **A selector added here must be added to the registry too.** The served set
//! is advertised for display and completion by
//! [`KnownNamespace::selector_catalogue`](tairix_resref::KnownNamespace::selector_catalogue),
//! and the `catalogued_selectors_are_recognised` test below proves every
//! advertised selector is one this resolver answers. That check is
//! one-directional — no test can enumerate match arms — so a new arm left out
//! of the catalogue simply stays undiscoverable in the shell.
