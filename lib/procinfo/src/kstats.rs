//! The shared kernel-statistics fetches (`plans/STRESSTEST.md` ST1/ST4).
//!
//! The kernel-wide observability queries — the memory-pressure gauge, the
//! reclaim ledger and its per-cache breakdown, the `ramzip` tier counters,
//! the per-CPU scheduler load, the bound-interrupt table, and the network
//! stack's interface and bond tables — are consumed by both the
//! `info:`/`stats:` resolver ([`mod@crate::resolve`]) and its terminal
//! clients (the `sysmon` monitor, the shell's resource-selector
//! enumeration), so the fetch + fail-closed decode lives here once. The
//! paged walks are the generic [`walk_pages`](crate::list) the process and
//! mount lists use; the scalar queries share its convention that a
//! structurally invalid reply is [`Errno::BadMagic`], never a partial
//! decode.
//!
//! A walk here is the *only* paging of its query in this crate: the
//! resolver's own per-name lookups are built on these walks (stopping at the
//! record they want) rather than re-deriving the loop, so a consumer that
//! needs the whole table — completion listing every interface — adds no
//! second walk of the same query.
//!
//! Most queries here are gated on `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` by `sysinfod`; a
//! denial surfaces as [`CallError::PermissionDenied`] so a consumer can
//! render the refusal and continue (the queries are observability, never
//! load-bearing for a session). The exceptions are the two coarse
//! self-regulation reads every process may make —
//! [`memory_pressure_band`] and [`memory_total_bytes`] — which each
//! document why they need no capability.
