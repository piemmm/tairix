//! RFC 1951 DEFLATE decompression.
//!
//! One resumable state machine serves two shapes. [`inflate_into`] decodes a
//! whole stream in one call — what `lib/image`'s PNG `IDAT` path wants, and
//! what a *foreign* encoder's finished output is. [`Inflater`] carries the
//! same machine plus a 32 KiB history window across calls, so a stream that
//! arrives in pieces — one SSH packet at a time, back-referencing packets
//! already delivered — decodes without ever holding the whole of it.
//!
//! A peer that flushes with zlib's `Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH` leaves the bit stream
//! mid-byte at a packet boundary, so the machine suspends and resumes at an
//! arbitrary bit, not merely between blocks. [`Inflater`] absorbs every byte
//! it is handed, so a caller never has to carry a remainder forward.
//!
//! # Bit and code ordering
//!
//! Per RFC 1951 §3.1.1, multi-bit *values* (block-type bits, HLIT/HDIST/
//! HCLEN, extra-length and extra-distance bits) are packed least-significant
//! bit first, while a Huffman *code* is packed most-significant bit first.
//! The internal bit accumulator serves the former; `decode_symbol` serves the
//! latter by growing the candidate code one bit at a time.
//!
//! # Huffman table strategy
//!
//! Symbols are decoded through the canonical count/offset walk from the
//! RFC's reference algorithm (as implemented by zlib's public-domain `puff`
//! decoder): the internal `build_huffman` counts codes per bit length,
//! checks the codespace is neither over- nor under-subscribed, and lays out
//! symbols in canonical order; `decode_symbol` then reads one bit at a
//! time, tracking the first code and symbol-table offset at each length,
//! and returns as soon as the bit-length band containing the accumulated
//! code is reached. This is O(code length) per symbol — never a linear scan
//! over all codes — and needs no allocation: every alphabet in RFC 1951
//! (288 literal/length symbols, 32 distance symbols, 19 code-length
//! symbols) fits a fixed-size table, so the internal `HuffmanTable` is a
//! plain array, keeping this module exactly as allocation-free as the rest
//! of the crate.
//!
//! A canonical Huffman code set is normally required to be *complete*
//! (every codepoint reachable): RFC 1951 permits exactly one exception,
//! reproduced from the reference decoder — a set with precisely one
//! nonzero-length code, of length 1, is under-subscribed but still legal
//! (some encoders emit this degenerate single-code table for a symbol
//! alphabet, such as a distance alphabet, that a particular block never
//! actually uses). `build_huffman` reports this case to the caller, which
//! accepts it only for the literal/length and distance tables — the
//! code-length alphabet that describes them must always be complete.
//!
//! # Trailing-byte policy
//!
//! [`inflate_into`] decompresses the whole stream in `src` and returns only
//! the number of bytes produced, per its signature. The zlib envelope
//! (`crate::zlib`) additionally needs to know exactly where the DEFLATE
//! stream ends within `src`, to locate the Adler-32 trailer that follows
//! it — a boundary that is only known once the final block has been
//! decoded, since DEFLATE carries no overall compressed-length field.
//! [`inflate_into_consumed`] reports that boundary (rounded up to the byte
//! containing the last bit of the final block — DEFLATE never leaves a
//! stream mid-byte) as a second return value. Bytes in `src` beyond that
//! boundary are never inspected by this module; whether they are trailing
//! garbage or, as in zlib, a meaningful trailer is entirely the caller's
//! concern. [`Progress::consumed`] reports the same boundary once
//! [`Progress::finished`] is set.
