//! The catalog document: its closed key registry, and the fail-closed
//! reading and canonical render over the one `key = value` document engine.
//!
//! One setting is one field of one record — a `<id>.<field>` dotted key —
//! in a plain [`tairix_appconf`] document, which is the format the app-data
//! store speaks. This module therefore defines the *registry* over that
//! format and no grammar of its own: the document's length, line, key and
//! value bounds, its comment rule, and its quoting are the engine's
//! (`plans/APPDATA.md` §1.3).
//!
//! [`load`] and [`document`] are inverses: reading a rendered catalog yields
//! the same catalog, and rendering a parsed one yields a byte-identical
//! document whatever order the records were built in. That is what lets an
//! editor read a store, change one record, and write it back without
//! disturbing anything else it holds.
//!
//! # Fail closed, whole document
//!
//! A catalog is read **strictly**: a line the grammar did not read as a
//! setting, a key outside the registry, or a value outside a field's
//! validator refuses the whole document. That is the opposite of a
//! *settings* registry, where one bad value costs only its own field, and
//! deliberately so — a catalog is a list, and a half-read one silently drops
//! or mis-files an application a user expects to find, with no field left
//! standing to say that anything is missing.
