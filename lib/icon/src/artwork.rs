//! Resolving an icon to drawable pixels: the shared artwork layer.
//!
//! [`IconKind`] and [`builtin_picture`] give the desktop a *total* set of
//! scalable built-in pictures — every kind always draws something: a settings
//! category its colour badge, every other kind a tintable glyph.
//! On top of that floor this module adds the preferred tiers: the shipped
//! **class artwork** under `/System/Graphics/Icons`, as either an
//! `<asset-id>.png` raster master or an `<asset-id>.svg` vector one, and above
//! it the icon a thing carries of its *own* — an application bundle's
//! `Resources/` master, named by its signed manifest. A draw site states both
//! in one [`IconRequest`] and the answer resolves in one order: the thing's
//! own icon, then its class's raster artwork, then its class's vector
//! artwork, then the built-in picture. Resolution is therefore total however
//! much of it is missing, and the order lives here rather than being
//! re-decided by each surface.
//!
//! Both the desktop session and the file manager are separate processes that
//! need this exact behaviour, so it lives here rather than in either of them.
//! Like [`IconAssetSource`](crate::IconAssetSource), the crate stays `no_std`
//! and owns no path to the filesystem or to a decoder: the bytes come through
//! an injected [`ArtworkReader`] (a capability-gated read) and the pixels
//! through an injected [`ArtworkRasteriser`] (the parser sandbox in
//! production), so the untrusted decode never runs in this library or in the
//! renderer that consumes it.
//!
//! # Who does the decode, and on which thread
//!
//! A miss costs a read plus a sandbox round trip, which is far too much to
//! spend inside a compositor's paint. [`ArtworkResolver`] is therefore the seam
//! between *deciding what a draw needs* and *producing it*: [`InlineArtwork`]
//! reads and decodes on the calling thread, and a caller with a worker thread
//! implements the trait over its own hand-off and answers [`Resolved::Pending`]
//! until the pixels land — the draw falls to the built-in glyph in the
//! meantime and the same lookup serves the artwork once it is there. Both use
//! [`render_artwork`], so an off-thread decode is the very same work the
//! inline one would have done.
//!
//! [`ArtworkCache`] retains each decode — success *or* refusal — keyed by what
//! was resolved and the requested side, over the one shared reclaimable-memory
//! cache (`lib/reclaim`) so a crowded or crafted bundle store can never grow a
//! session without bound. [`IconArtworkSource`] binds a cache to its resolver
//! so a renderer can be handed a plain [`IconArtwork`] lookup that borrows the
//! pixels without knowing anything about I/O, and [`NoArtwork`] is the
//! all-glyph lookup a headless build or a test uses.
