//! A settings category's or pane's colour badge: its symbol in white on a
//! plate of its own hue.
//!
//! A reader finds a category by colour before they read its name, so the hue
//! is part of the icon's identity rather than a tint a theme applies — the
//! same badge reads on the light and dark desktops alike. It is vector art
//! drawn at the exact side a slot asks for: the plate's flat edges fall on the
//! slot's own pixel boundaries, and nothing is ever resampled, so no scale
//! leaves one edge of a stroke solid and its opposite edge grey.
