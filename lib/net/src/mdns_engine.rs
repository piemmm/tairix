//! The per-interface multicast DNS responder and querier (RFC 6762 §5–§10).
//!
//! One engine per interface. It owns no socket, no clock, and no randomness:
//! the caller hands it received datagrams with the address and port they came
//! from, monotonic `now` values, a CSPRNG for the jitter the protocol
//! mandates, and a buffer to write outgoing datagrams into.
//!
//! # Tickless
//!
//! [`MdnsEngine::next_deadline`] folds every timer the protocol needs —
//! probe, announce, response delay, query backoff, cache expiry, cache
//! refresh — into one instant. The caller arms a single one-shot for it and
//! calls [`MdnsEngine::poll`] when it fires, repeatedly until it answers
//! `None`. Nothing here spins and nothing here polls.
//!
//! # What a query costs a hostile sender
//!
//! Answering is bounded three ways. A record is multicast at most once per
//! second (RFC 6762 §6), so a flood of identical questions produces one
//! answer. A unicast reply is charged to a per-peer budget and to a budget
//! for the interface, so a peer that asks faster than the segment can
//! usefully carry is answered less, not more. And a query whose source is
//! not on-link is not answered at all — an mDNS reflector is an amplifier
//! with a published multiplier.
