//! The text-measurement memo: one string's cumulative per-`char` advances,
//! retained beside the glyph bitmaps they were derived from.
//!
//! A proportional family has no cell width to multiply by, so measuring a
//! label costs one advance lookup per character — work a repaint redid every
//! frame for text that never changed. [`measure`] walks the string once into a
//! [`MeasuredText`], and width, truncation, and elision are then all queries
//! over that one array: the width is its last entry, and the longest prefix
//! that fits a box is a binary search for the last entry within it.
//!
//! # The key fingerprints the text, the value keeps it
//!
//! The measured bytes live in the value, keyed by their length and CRC-32C.
//! A lookup then builds its key without allocating, and the cache wipes a
//! released value where a dropped key would leave the text — a user's own
//! filenames and window titles — readable in reused heap. A fingerprint clash
//! is caught by comparing the retained bytes, so a colliding string is
//! measured afresh rather than served the wrong width.
//!
//! # The face is in the key, not the epoch
//!
//! An epoch change empties the whole cache, and one frame measures several
//! text roles at several sizes, so an epoch keyed on the face would throw
//! away every other role's measurements at each switch. Family, pixel height,
//! and weight are part of the key instead: a different scale or face is a
//! different entry, so a stale answer cannot be served. The epoch carries what
//! changes the advances of a face already measured — the generation of the
//! advance source itself, moved on whenever a font transport is installed or
//! replaced.
