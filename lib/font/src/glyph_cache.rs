//! The one shared cached-glyph declaration used on both sides of the
//! font-service boundary: the render path's client cache ([`crate::client`])
//! and the sandboxed font service's own cache (`fontd`,
//! `userland/system/fontd`).
//!
//! A client-fetched glyph and a service-rasterised glyph are the same kind
//! of memory from the reclaimable-memory model's point of view: the same
//! 8-bit coverage bitmap, cheap to lose (the canonical source — the service
//! or the outline it parsed — rebuilds it), and revealing of a user's own
//! displayed text. Before this module they were declared twice, with the
//! same bounded-entry-count shape and the same hand-picked ceiling on each
//! side of the endpoint; that duplication is exactly what let one of the two
//! copies remain an *entry-count* bound while the other side's caller
//! (a remote, hostile-capable IPC client) could drive it to hundreds of
//! megabytes by varying the requested cell height. [`CachedGlyph`],
//! [`glyph_cache_candidate`], and [`glyph_cache_budget`] are the single
//! definition both sides build their own [`tairix_reclaim::ReclaimCache`]
//! from, so the shape and the budget can never drift apart again.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `lib/font`
//!
//! `fontd` already depends on `lib/font`'s atlas geometry constants, so
//! adding this module here creates no new reverse edge:
//! `userland/system/fontd` gains a second import from a crate it already
//! imports from, while `lib/font` gains nothing from `fontd` at all. The
//! alternative — a third crate holding just this module — would be a
//! one-line wrapper crate for two consumers that already share a home.
//!
//! # The budget fraction
//!
//! [`glyph_cache_budget`] derives its ceiling from the machine's total RAM
//! rather than a hand-picked constant, so a small board and a large server
//! each get a cache proportioned to what they actually have. The chosen
//! fraction, 1/4096th, is deliberately far smaller than the 1/16th a
//! kernel-heap-backed cache takes: a font glyph's working set is a few
//! hundred distinct `(scalar, height, weight)` combinations at any one
//! time — the visible character repertoire at the handful of sizes and
//! weights a session actually draws — each at most
//! `FONT_MAX_COVERAGE_LEN` (the widest, tallest permitted bitmap) bytes and
//! typically a few hundred. A 1 GiB machine is left 256 KiB, already generous for that
//! working set; a 64 GiB server is left 16 MiB, still a vanishing fraction
//! of its RAM. Zero total RAM (the query unanswered or the service absent)
//! yields a zero budget, which admits nothing: every glyph is then served
//! freshly built and never retained — correct, merely uncached, and never a
//! fallback to an unbounded or hand-picked cache.
