//! Shared text rasterisation primitives (`lib/font`).
//!
//! This crate is the system's text-rendering front end. It holds two things
//! and no font outline: the compiled-in **console atlas** ([`atlas`], emitted
//! by `cargo xtask font-atlas --write` from the committed SIL OFL 1.1 primary
//! Inconsolata EX face in `assets/`) with the Unicode glyph lookup over it
//! ([`glyph`]), and — behind the default-on `render` feature — the
//! service-backed blitter ([`font`]) that draws onto a `lib/raster` `Surface`.
//! Font rendering is one of the curated shared-library classes; like
//! `lib/geometry`, `lib/theme`, and `lib/raster`, it lives in `lib/*` so the
//! taskbar and the default apps can draw text without depending on the window
//! manager.
//!
//! # The atlas is the console's whole repertoire
//!
//! The compiled-in atlas covers every face of the console family — Latin,
//! Greek, Cyrillic, box drawing, arrows, punctuation and currency from
//! Inconsolata EX, the Japanese, Korean and Hebrew companions, and U+FFFD for
//! anything outside them (`plans/FONT-SERVICE.md` §2.4). It is the
//! boot/headless text console's glyph source (`lib/fbcon`, which brings its
//! own allocator-free blitter via `default-features = false`), and it supplies
//! the render path's monospace **geometry constants**. The console runs in the
//! kernel and cannot call `fontd`, so a script left out of the atlas is one it
//! could never draw at any point — a `man` page, a login prompt or a panic
//! alike. `fontd` reads the same faces at runtime for scalable proportional
//! text (below).
//!
//! # Rendering goes through the sandboxed font service
//!
//! With the `render` feature, [`BitmapFont`] is a thin, cached client of the
//! OS font service `fontd` (`plans/FONT-SERVICE.md`): it parses no TrueType
//! and holds no face, and [`BitmapFont::draw_text`] fetches each glyph's 8-bit
//! coverage, and each family's line metrics, from the service over
//! `FONT_ENDPOINT` (see [`client`]) and blits it. `fontd` owns the installed
//! `/System/Fonts` faces and rasterises every family, scalar, and size on
//! demand in a minimum-capability sandbox, so a malformed face faults only
//! that sandbox, never a compositor or terminal. The transport is injected: a
//! program links it with `tairix-font/rt`, a host test installs a mock
//! ([`set_font_transport`]); with no transport a draw composites nothing
//! (fail closed) rather than reaching for local font data.
//!
//! A [`BitmapFont`] names a **family** ([`FamilyKey`]) and renders it at a
//! chosen pixel height in physical pixels. [`BitmapFont::console`] keeps the
//! fixed-pitch built-in family at its native size (what the text console
//! draws), [`BitmapFont::monospace`] renders that same family at any other
//! size, and [`BitmapFont::new`]
//! renders any family at any size — the desktop resolves a comfortable size
//! from the theme's logical font size and the DPI scale. A monospace family
//! shares one advance for every glyph; a proportional family advances each
//! glyph by its own reported width, so [`BitmapFont::advance`],
//! [`BitmapFont::text_width`], and [`BitmapFont::truncate_to_width`] measure
//! through the per-glyph advance either way. The cell model for a monospace
//! grid stays one scalar per grid entry, a wide Japanese or Korean bitmap
//! covering the lead and continuation cells reserved by `tairix_vt::char_width`.
//!
//! # Fitting a label to its box
//!
//! Above that measurement sit the two shared fitters every text region too
//! narrow for its label uses, so none of them writes its own break loop:
//! [`BitmapFont::elide_to_width`] cuts to a prefix and reports that
//! [`ELLIPSIS`] is needed, and [`BitmapFont::wrap_to_width`] lays a label
//! over a bounded number of lines, breaking at whitespace and eliding only
//! the last. Wrapping is a lazy iterator of [`TextLine`]s borrowing the
//! label, so a caller counts the lines and draws them without allocating.
//!
//! # A shared cache declaration for the whole endpoint
//!
//! [`glyph_cache`] (feature `glyph-cache`, pulled in by `render`) declares
//! the one cached-glyph value type, classification, and RAM-derived byte
//! budget both this crate's own client cache and `fontd`'s service-side
//! cache build their bounded cache from, so a glyph cache is declared once
//! rather than separately on each side of the font-service boundary.
//!
//! # Measurement is memoised, not recomputed per frame
//!
//! Measuring a proportional label costs one advance lookup per character, so
//! the walk is memoised on the same RAM-derived, pressure-governed terms as
//! the glyph bitmaps: [`BitmapFont::text_width`],
//! [`BitmapFont::truncate_to_width`], and [`BitmapFont::elide_to_width`] are
//! all queries over one retained array of cumulative advances, and a repaint
//! of unchanged text measures nothing. A monospace family multiplies a cell
//! width instead and never consults the memo.
