//! The font-service client: the render path's thin, cached front end to the
//! sandboxed OS font service (`fontd`) over the reserved `FONT_ENDPOINT`.
//!
//! `lib/font` parses no TrueType and holds no font outline: the faces live
//! only in `fontd`, which rasterises a scalar from a named family at a
//! chosen pixel height in its own minimum-capability sandbox and returns the
//! small 8-bit coverage bitmap the blitter composites, or reports a family's
//! line metrics. A malformed face can therefore fault only that sandbox,
//! never a compositor or a terminal.
//!
//! # Transport seam
//!
//! Drawing text takes no client handle — [`crate::BitmapFont::draw_text`] is a
//! plain method — so the client is a process-global behind a [`FontTransport`]
//! seam: production installs the `ipc_call`-backed transport, a host test
//! installs a mock. Under the optional `rt` feature the seam defaults lazily
//! to the runtime transport, so a program that links `tairix-rt` needs no
//! setup; without a transport a draw composites nothing, fail closed, rather
//! than reaching for a device.
//!
//! # Two locks, and never both at once
//!
//! Userland is multi-threaded, so this process-global state is locked — with
//! the runtime's futex mutex, because a preempted holder would make a spinning
//! waiter burn a whole quantum against a thread that is not running. The state
//! is split in two: the *caches* are pure memory and their lock is held for the
//! span of a run; the *channel* owns the one transport and its lock *is* held
//! across the `fontd` round trip. A fetch releases the caches before taking the
//! channel, so the caches lock never spans a syscall and no thread ever holds
//! both — the whole discipline, with no lock order to get wrong. The crate's
//! internal font-client trait is where it lives.
//!
//! # Local caches
//!
//! Each glyph reply is memoised per `(scalar, family, pixel height, weight)`
//! in a [`tairix_reclaim::ReclaimCache`] ([`crate::glyph_cache`]), so a
//! steady-state redraw of the same text in the same family, size, and weight
//! issues no IPC. The byte budget is derived from the machine's total RAM,
//! never a hand-picked entry count, so a hostile or careless caller who
//! renders at ever more sizes and scalars can grow the cache only up to that
//! budget before the oldest entries are evicted. Until a cache is installed —
//! before an `rt` program's first draw, or in a host test that never calls
//! [`set_glyph_cache`] — every glyph is fetched and served uncached: correct,
//! merely one IPC per glyph.
//!
//! Each family's line metrics are memoised per `(family, pixel height,
//! weight)` in a small fixed-capacity cache: a process draws only a handful
//! of distinct combinations (the theme's role ladder, times a couple of
//! families, times the three weights), so unlike the glyph cache a byte
//! budget would be over-engineering — a bounded ring buffer of entries is
//! cheap, simple, and already generous for that working set.
//!
//! A proportional family's *measurements* are memoised the same way as its
//! glyphs, in the crate's `measure` module: the per-character advance walk a
//! label costs is done once and answered from thereafter, so a repaint of
//! unchanged text measures nothing. A monospace family never reaches the memo
//! — its width is a multiplication.
