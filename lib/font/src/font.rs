//! The system bitmap font and the glyph blitter that draws it onto a
//! [`Surface`].
//!
//! [`BitmapFont`] is a thin, cached front end to the sandboxed OS font
//! service (`fontd`): it names a **family**, a pixel height, and a weight,
//! and fetches both a family's line metrics and each glyph's coverage
//! bitmap from the service over [`crate::client`]. No font outline or face
//! lives in this process.
//!
//! # Monospace and proportional families draw through one path
//!
//! A family is either fixed-pitch (every glyph shares one advance,
//! [`BitmapFont::monospace_advance`] reports it) or proportional (each
//! glyph advances by its own reported width). [`BitmapFont::advance`],
//! [`BitmapFont::text_width`], [`BitmapFont::truncate_to_width`], and
//! [`BitmapFont::draw_text`] all measure through the per-glyph advance the
//! service reports, so the same code lays out either kind of family — a
//! monospace family simply reports the same advance for every glyph. A
//! caller that must draw a character grid (a terminal, a hex view) uses
//! [`BitmapFont::monospace`] or [`BitmapFont::new`] with a monospace family
//! and reads [`BitmapFont::cell_width`] for its column width; desktop chrome
//! measures with [`BitmapFont::text_width`]/[`BitmapFont::advance`] instead
//! of multiplying a character count by a cell width.
//!
//! [`BitmapFont::draw_text`] composites each fetched glyph onto a `lib/raster`
//! [`Surface`] through that crate's single premultiplied-alpha
//! [`Pixel::over`] path: the text colour is premultiplied once, scaled per
//! 8-bit coverage level into a 256-entry table, and blended per lit pixel —
//! so anti-aliased edges and translucent text both come out right with no
//! colour arithmetic duplicated here.
//!
//! # Fitting a label to its box
//!
//! [`BitmapFont::elide_to_width`] and [`BitmapFont::wrap_to_width`] build on
//! that one measurement: the first reserves room for [`ELLIPSIS`] and cuts,
//! the second breaks a label at whitespace across a bounded number of lines
//! and elides only the last. Both borrow slices of the caller's text and
//! allocate nothing, so a label laid out every repaint costs no heap
//! traffic.
