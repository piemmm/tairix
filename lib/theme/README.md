# tairix-theme

The single shared desktop **theme definition** for TAIRiX (`AGENTS.md` §6,
§10 — `PLAN.md` Stage 7). One theme drives the colours, corner radii, fonts,
and cursors of the window manager, the taskbar, and the default apps, with a
default dark theme and a light theme switchable at runtime.

This crate is pure theme *data*. A `Theme` is a table of:

- `Palette` — semantic `Rgba` colour roles (`desktop`, `surface`,
  `surface_raised`, `on_surface`, `on_surface_muted`, `accent`,
  `on_accent`, `selection_fill`, `border`), the four window-command highlight
  hues (`window_close`, `window_minimize`, `window_maximize`,
  `window_put_to_back`), plus the two floating-chrome opacities and
  `title_hue_alpha`. Roles are fixed fields, so a theme can never omit one and a
  consumer can never ask for one that does not exist.
  `title_hue_alpha` (`82`) governs a colour the palette does not name: a title
  bar washes its band with the dominant hue of its *window's identity icon*, so
  the theme sets only how far through it reads, and `title_hue_reach` (`500`
  logical pixels) how far it travels from the icon before it is gone.
  `chrome_alpha` (`204`) is how opaque a floating desktop-chrome surface is —
  the taskbar and the popups it opens, laid over a backdrop the compositor
  blurs by `chrome_backdrop_blur` — and the ground of a frosted application
  window. Such a surface keeps whichever colour role
  it wears when solid and takes this alpha, so a frosted bar is recognisably
  the same grey a solid one was and what is behind it reads through; anything
  that reads as *part* of it — a list row, a menu row — takes the same alpha
  on floating chrome, which is what keeps a resting row exactly its ground
  rather than a patch on it. `chrome_plate_alpha` (`229`) is the step more
  solid a control plate *raised* on floating chrome takes — a button, a text
  field, a card — so it reads as furniture standing on the glass rather than a
  hole cut in it. On a frosted window only the ground is glass: its rows and
  plates are solid. Both are alphas, not colours; `255` draws
  chrome solid.
  `selection_fill` is the plate a selected item is filled
  with — each theme's own `accent` at three tenths opacity (`#d1550f4d` on dark,
  `#c8500c4d` on light), authored per theme so a theme can tune its weight
  rather than have it derived at the draw site. It is this light because the
  frosted backdrop under a selected item is what marks it, leaving the accent
  to tint rather than to cover.
- `Metrics` — corner radii (window, taskbar, popup) and border thickness,
  the data the window manager's single anti-aliased rounded-corner path
  consumes; `taskbar_margin`, how far the bar stands off the three screen edges
  it faces (`5`), and `chrome_backdrop_blur`, how far the backdrop behind it
  and its popups is blurred (`7`); plus `selection_backdrop_blur`, how far the
  *backdrop* behind a
  selected item is blurred, in logical pixels (`6` in both themes). The fill
  itself keeps a crisp edge; the pixels it covers — a window's surface, the
  wallpaper — are frosted through the same filter the compositor frosts a
  window's backdrop with. Short on purpose: a box blur of radius `r` averages
  `2r + 1` samples, so a radius approaching the item's own size averages its
  whole backdrop to one colour and the mark becomes a smudge instead of glass.
  It takes the fine detail and leaves the larger shapes; `lib/controls`
  brackets it from both sides where the mark is actually drawn.
- `Timeline` — one animation in flight: the single definition of how a theme's
  duration becomes frames. A surface starts one for the interaction it is
  beginning, reads `progress` (linear, for a strength fade) or `eased`
  (smoothstep, for anything that travels) when it paints, and reads
  `next_frame_in` to know when to wake — the nearer of what remains and one
  frame at 60 Hz. It reads no clock of its own; the embedder passes the
  monotonic instant it already holds. Running and settled are the whole of the
  model. A zero duration starts *settled*: complete, asking for no wake, so
  reduced motion needs no second code path and an idle surface arms no timer.
  A *running* one always owes at least one more frame, due **now** once the
  span has run out or the clock has jumped behind its start — that frame is
  the end state, which presenting the previous one routinely outlasts, so
  answering "nothing" there would strand it undrawn. The owner draws it and
  then settles or drops the timeline; that, not the clock, ends the sequence.
- `Fade` — one strength ramp in flight: a `Timeline` carrying a value from
  where it started to where it is going. A timeline answers *how far
  through*; a fade answers *what the strength is*. Every surface that
  dissolves between two strengths — the login screen's veil covering the
  screen and lifting off it again, a session's screen revealing from black
  and going back to it — is this one state machine, so the two directions
  cannot drift apart. The direction is nothing more than the two ends: a ramp
  to `u8::MAX` covers, one to `0` uncovers, and one begun part-way names the
  strength it starts from, so a fade that interrupts another resumes from
  what is actually on screen rather than snapping somewhere it never was.
  The interpolation is linear, like every fade's, because the strength is
  what the eye reads and not the travel.
- `MotionTheme` — one duration per `MotionInteraction`, in milliseconds, held
  as a table indexed by the interaction so a duration can never be transposed
  onto the wrong one. `StageTransition` (`240` ms) is one view giving way to
  another, `AttemptRejected` (`420` ms) the shake on a refused attempt, and
  `SessionFade` (`1000` ms) a whole session's screen appearing or leaving —
  the login screen appearing out of black and fading back to it once a secret
  is accepted, the desktop revealing from that black and dissolving back into
  it when the session ends. `BackdropChange` (`600` ms) is the desktop's
  backdrop giving way to another: the wallpaper arriving over the plain
  backdrop colour, and one wallpaper dissolving into the next.
  `SelectionChange` (`100` ms in both themes) is the
  cross-fade as a selection mark moves between items. Reduced motion reports
  every duration as `0`, which a consumer reads as "change it now", so no
  control carries a second reduced-motion path.
- `Fonts` — one `FontSpec` (family, size, weight) per `TextRole`, referencing
  faces under `/System/Fonts`. A theme sizes text by the *job* it does
  (`Display`, `Heading`, `ItemTitle`, `WindowTitle`, `Body`, `Metric`,
  `Caption`, `SectionHeader`, `Monospace`), and every role's size is a
  percentage of one authored base size measured from the design boards, so a
  theme states one number and the whole scale follows (`AGENTS.md` §2.2).
  `Fonts::ladder` clamps that base into `MIN_BASE_SIZE_PX..=MAX_BASE_SIZE_PX`,
  so text can be neither too small to read nor too large to rasterise
  (`AGENTS.md` §5.4). `Display` is the top rung — the single dominant line on
  a screen of its own, such as the login and lock screens' clock — and is the
  one deliberate break from the tight ladder the other roles keep. Every rung
  is set `TEXT_WEIGHT_LIFT` heavier than its named weight along the face's own
  `wght` axis (`lifted`), so interface text reads full rather than thin while
  the hierarchy stays as the boards set it.
- `CursorSet` — one cursor asset id per `CursorKind`, referencing assets
  under `/System/Graphics`. `CURSOR_KINDS` is the closed kind list, beside the
  enum, so a loader or a cache never restates it.

A theme also carries the **ground** its surfaces are drawn on (`SurfaceGround`,
reported by `Theme::ground`): `Opaque` by default, `Floating` on the copy
`Theme::floating()` returns — the theme the taskbar draws its bar and its
popups with — and `Frosted` on the copy `Theme::frosted()` returns, for an
application window whose own ground is that glass and whose content is solid.
`Theme::backdrop_blur()` is the blur that ground reads over, so the fills and
the blur come from one answer, and `ThemeRegistry::active_on(ground)` holds
each grounded form beside the active theme, dropped with it on every switch.
The ground rides on the theme rather than on each control, so everything drawn
with one theme agrees and no control can be forgotten and left an opaque patch;
`lib/controls` is where a background becomes the chrome alpha for its layer.

The crate owns no rendering or compositing arithmetic — that lives in the
shared rasteriser `lib/raster`. A consumer converts a theme `Rgba` into the
shared render colour at the edge (`lib/raster` provides `From<Rgba> for
tairix_raster::Color`), so the colour algebra is never duplicated
(`AGENTS.md` §2.2).

`ThemeRegistry` owns the available themes and the active selection. It always
holds the two built-ins (so there is always an active theme), switches with
`set_active`, and accepts custom themes with `register` — adding a theme is
data, not code (`AGENTS.md` §10). Both mutators fail closed: an unknown id or
a duplicate id returns a `ThemeError` and changes nothing (`AGENTS.md` §5.4 /
§2.9).

The runtime light/dark control toggles the `Appearance` axis rather than a
specific id: `set_appearance(Appearance)` activates the matching built-in and
`toggle_appearance` flips to the opposite built-in based on the active theme's
appearance. Both return the now-active `ThemeId` and cannot fail (the
built-ins are always present), so there is no error path to surface.

`Appearance` itself is `tairix_abi::desktop::Appearance`, re-exported rather
than restated: the desktop session reports the active appearance to every
application over the window channel, and the byte on that wire must be the
same value a theme carries (`AGENTS.md` §2.2). An app told the desktop has
switched simply passes it to `set_appearance`.

## Why it lives in `lib/`

Sibling userland crates may not depend on one another (`AGENTS.md` §17.4), so
the one definition the GUI crates and apps all read belongs in `lib/*`,
exactly as `lib/procinfo` is the shared home for the System Information
client helpers. The crate sits at the bottom of the §17.4 layering: its only
dependency is `lib/abi`, for the two vocabularies a theme shares with an ABI
surface (`FontWeight`, which the font service rasterises at, and
`Appearance`, which the window channel reports) — imported rather than
restated so the values cannot drift. It depends on no kernel, driver, or
userland crate.

## Stability tier

`experimental` — the surface is the Stage 7 desktop theming seam, consumed
first by `userland/gui/wm` and, in later increments, by the taskbar and the
default apps. It is `no_std` (with `alloc`) and depends only on `lib/abi`. No
`unsafe`, and no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths (`AGENTS.md`
§2.9).
