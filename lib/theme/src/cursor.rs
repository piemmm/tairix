//! The pointer cursors a theme selects, and the identity of a cursor *set*.
//!
//! Two independent selections meet in the cursor store, and the names of
//! both live here rather than beside the artwork:
//!
//! * a [`CursorSetId`] names one **set** — a family of artwork the user
//!   chooses, a directory in the shipped store;
//! * a [`CursorSet`] names one **asset per kind** *within* whichever set is
//!   active, so a theme may point at artwork of its own. It is a fixed
//!   record with one field per kind, so a theme always defines every cursor
//!   and a lookup can never miss.
//!
//! An asset therefore resolves as `<set>/<asset id>.svg`, and
//! [`CursorSet::canonical`] is the naming the shipped sets are authored
//! against.
