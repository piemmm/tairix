//! The runtime theme registry.
//!
//! [`ThemeRegistry`] owns the themes available on a running system and the
//! one that is currently active. It always contains the two built-in
//! themes, so there is always an active theme to return; switching themes
//! at runtime is [`set_active`](ThemeRegistry::set_active), and adding a
//! custom theme is [`register`](ThemeRegistry::register) — data, not code.
//!
//! Both mutators fail closed: selecting an unknown theme
//! or registering a duplicate id returns a [`ThemeError`] and leaves the
//! registry unchanged, rather than panicking.
