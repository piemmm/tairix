//! Geometric theme metrics: the corner radii and line thicknesses that

//!
//! These are the *data* the window manager's single anti-aliased
//! rounded-corner path consumes: the theme says how round a window is, and
//! the compositor rounds it. A radius of `0` means square corners. The
//! taskbar is not among them — it is a stadium, so its radius follows its own
//! thickness rather than a number a theme could set.
//!
//! Every length here is in *logical* pixels at the reference density
//! (`tairix_geometry::REFERENCE_DPI`). The desktop's DPI / UI scale
//! (`tairix_geometry::Scale`) converts them to physical pixels at render
//! time, so the same theme stays a comfortable physical size across panel
//! densities.
