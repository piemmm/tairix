//! The fonts a theme selects, one per *text role*.
//!
//! A theme names text by the job it does — a panel heading, a list item's
//! title, its secondary detail line, a column header, a metric readout — not
//! by the widget that draws it. Each role resolves to a [`FontSpec`]: the
//! key of an installed family under `/System/Fonts` plus a size and a
//! weight. This crate stores the reference, it does not rasterise glyphs.
//!
//! Sizes are *logical* pixels at the reference density
//! (`tairix_geometry::REFERENCE_DPI`); the desktop's DPI / UI scale
//! (`tairix_geometry::Scale`) converts a size to physical pixels when a face
//! is rasterised, so text stays a comfortable physical size across panel
//! densities.
//!
//! # One ladder, derived from one base size
//!
//! The design boards (`plans/desktop1.png`, `plans/desktop2a.png`) carry their
//! hierarchy with a deliberately *tight* size ladder and a rising weight: a
//! secondary detail line is a little smaller than the item title above it, a
//! column header is smaller still but bold, and a panel heading is a step
//! larger. Every role therefore states its size as a percentage of the one
//! authored base size ([`Fonts::ladder`]) rather than as an independent
//! number, so the whole desktop's type scales together and no two roles can
//! silently drift apart.
