//! The colour roles a theme defines.
//!
//! A [`Palette`] is a fixed set of *semantic* colour roles, not a free-form
//! map: every role is a named field, so a theme cannot omit one and a
//! consumer cannot ask for a role that does not exist (illegal states are
//! unrepresentable). The window manager, the taskbar,
//! and the default apps all read these same roles, which is what makes a
//! theme switch apply consistently everywhere from one definition.
