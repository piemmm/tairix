//! x86_64 hardware CRC-32C candidate, over the SSE4.2 `crc32` instruction.
//!
//! Compiled only when the target architecture is x86_64 (the build-script
//! `crc32c_x86_64` cfg). The `crc32` instruction (`CPUID.1:ECX.SSE4_2`)
//! computes exactly the Castagnoli CRC-32C the portable baseline does, on
//! general-purpose registers — no XMM/vector state — so it carries none of the
//! freestanding-SIMD codegen risk the wide-vector extensions do, and needs no
//! FPU/SIMD save across the call.
//!
//! The function is only ever reached after `lib/cpuops` has confirmed the
//! [`CpuFeature::Sse42`](tairix_abi::cpufeatures::CpuFeature::Sse42) bit is
//! present and self-verified the output against the portable reference, so the
//! instruction can never trap on a core that lacks it and a decode bug can
//! never be selected.
