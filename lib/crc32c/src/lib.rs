//! TAIRiX CRC-32C (Castagnoli) checksum — the one first-party definition.
//!
//! CRC-32C is the fast, **non-cryptographic** block-integrity checksum TAIRiX
//! uses to catch media / transport corruption (bit rot, torn writes,
//! misdirected reads) cheaply, before the expensive cryptographic checks run.
//! It is *not* a security primitive: authenticity rests on the AEAD tag and
//! the cryptographic content hash, so a first-party implementation is
//! permitted (the charter's "never hand-roll crypto" bar does not apply to an
//! error-detecting checksum).
//!
//! CRC-32C (the Castagnoli polynomial, reflected `0x1EDC_6F41` →
//! `0x82F6_3B78`) is chosen over an ad-hoc hash because it has *guaranteed*
//! Hamming-distance error-detection properties a general-purpose hash lacks,
//! and because both Tier-1 native ISAs with a CRC instruction compute exactly
//! it in one general-purpose-register instruction: x86_64 SSE4.2 `crc32` and
//! the `ARMv8` `crc32c*` family. It is the same checksum ext4 metadata, btrfs,
//! `iSCSI`, and SCTP standardised on.
//!
//! # Two implementations, one selected at runtime
//!
//! The crate carries a portable table-driven [`crc32c_portable`] baseline that
//! is always correct on every target, plus per-architecture hardware
//! candidates (`x86_64`/`aarch64` modules, compiled behind a build-script-emitted
//! `crc32c_<arch>` cfg — the charter-legal `lib/abi-trap` precedent, so no
//! target-architecture conditional-compilation predicate appears in the source
//! the `cfg-check` guards). Which one
//! a process uses is decided **once**, by [`resolve`], from the
//! [`CpuFeatureSet`] the kernel delivers it (never by probing the instruction
//! blindly, which would trap). Selection goes through the generic `lib/cpuops`
//! framework, so the hardware candidate is:
//!
//! 1. **capability-gated** — chosen only when the required feature bit is set;
//! 2. **self-verified** — its output is checked bit-for-bit against the
//!    portable reference over a fixed vector of edge-case inputs before it can
//!    ever be selected, so a decode bug is structurally unpickable;
//! 3. **fail-closed** — if the bit is absent or verification fails, the
//!    portable baseline is used. [`checksum`] before [`resolve`] runs (or after
//!    a failed resolve) is the portable baseline too — never a trap, never a
//!    panic.
//!
//! [`checksum`] is the hot-path entry consumers call; it reads the resolved
//! implementation from a set-once cell (no code patching — a plain function
//! pointer, W^X-clean).
