//! aarch64 hardware CRC-32C candidate, over the `crc32c*` instructions.
//!
//! Compiled only when the target architecture is aarch64 (the build-script
//! `crc32c_aarch64` cfg). The ARMv8 CRC32 extension
//! (`ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1.CRC32`, the [`CpuFeature::Crc32`](tairix_abi::cpufeatures::CpuFeature::Crc32) bit) provides both the
//! ISO-HDLC `crc32*` and the Castagnoli `crc32c*` instruction families; this
//! candidate uses `crc32cx`/`crc32cb`, which compute exactly the Castagnoli
//! CRC-32C the portable baseline does, on general-purpose registers (no NEON
//! state), so it carries no freestanding-SIMD codegen risk.
//!
//! [`CpuFeature::Crc32`](tairix_abi::cpufeatures::CpuFeature::Crc32) gates the
//! whole extension, so the same bit that admits this candidate guarantees the
//! `crc32c*` encodings are legal. It is only reached after `lib/cpuops`
//! confirms the bit and self-verifies the output against the reference.
