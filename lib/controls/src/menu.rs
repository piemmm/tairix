//! The menu command surface: [`MenuItem`] and [`Menu`] (spec §11.10), the
//! shared plate placement rule [`plate_rect`], and [`ChainModel`] — the one
//! model every menu the desktop renders is built as.
//!
//! A menu is a *pinned command plate*, not floating ornament: an elevated
//! `surface_raised` plate with a Signal Rim, carrying a column of row controls.
//! Each [`MenuItem`] is a row with a label and an optional leading icon,
//! trailing shortcut, and submenu marker. The [`Menu`] owns keyboard
//! navigation (Up/Down move the current row, Enter/Space activate it, Escape
//! dismisses), pointer hover/click, and emits a typed [`MenuAction`]; it
//! performs no privileged work — the owner enforces authority. Every colour,
//! metric, radius, and *face* resolves from the active [`Theme`]
//! and [`Scale`]; nothing here restates a recipe the shared `crate::paint`
//! core already owns.
//!
//! [`ChainModel`] lives here rather than with the chain that renders it
//! (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §1.6) because a menu's *clients* are not all in the
//! process that owns the chain: the desktop's own icon bar builds one, the
//! desktop's backdrop builds one, and an application's wire declaration
//! decodes into one. One model, beside the rows and plates it is made of.
