//! Decision-surface controls: [`Dialog`], [`Tooltip`], and [`HelpTip`]
//! (spec §11.24, §11.32).
//!
//! These are the desktop's *decision* surfaces — the modal choice, the
//! immediate-affordance hint, and the explanation of why an action is
//! unavailable or recommended. Each is drawn over the shared `crate::paint`
//! core (the one elevated-plate recipe) and the shared `lib/theme` tokens, so
//! nothing here restates a visual recipe. A dialog and a
//! help tip render state and emit typed actions; the owning service enforces
//! authority, and a capability denial reads distinctly from a disabled control
//! — never collapsed into a generic inactive look (spec §13).
