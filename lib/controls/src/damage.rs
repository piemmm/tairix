//! The damage sink a control reports its own repainted pixels into.
//!
//! A control is host-composed: it owns no tree, and the host's only signal
//! that anything changed is the render-equivalence comparison every family
//! derives, which fails for the whole surface as soon as one control's hover
//! flips. The sink is the missing seam. An input or update call takes it, the
//! control pushes *its own* bounds when a drawn state field changes, and the
//! host renders and presents only what came back.
//!
//! Reporting goes through one guarded write, so no family — and no host — grows
//! its own idea of when a change is worth a repaint. Hit-testing bookkeeping —
//! the last pointer position, a press latch — is not a drawn field and reports
//! nothing, the same rule that keeps it out of the render comparison.
//!
//! [`set`] and [`move_mark`] are public because a host reports its own drawn
//! changes with them. A control reports what it changes itself; a host that
//! commits a value into a control, or moves a mark of its own between two
//! controls, is the only party that knows where it put them, so it guards its
//! own field here rather than hand-rolling a comparison beside every setter.
//!
//! [`Repaint`] is what a host carries between the reporting and the painting:
//! a surface's own standing account of what it still owes the screen. It lives
//! here because it is the same account for every host-composed surface — the
//! desktop's menu plates and the icon bar's five surfaces read one definition.

///
/// A host pays for a reported rectangle twice: once to re-render clipped to
/// it, once to present it. The compositor already refuses more than eight
/// present round trips for one frame and collapses anything past that to a
/// single bounding box, so a ninth rectangle can never buy its own present —
/// it would only add another clip-and-render walk for pixels the present is
/// going to carry anyway.
///
/// Eight is also comfortably above what one routed pointer event can produce:
/// it reaches at most the child the pointer left, the child it entered, a
/// child holding a press, and the container's own chrome — four. So an
/// interactive frame stays exact to the control that changed, while a
