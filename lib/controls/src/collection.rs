//! The collection controls: [`ListRow`], [`TableRow`], [`TableCell`],
//! [`TableHeader`], [`Card`], and [`Panel`] (spec §11.13–§11.16).
//!
//! Rows, tables, cards, and panels are the surfaces that *group* other state
//! and actions. They are controls in their own right: a row can be hovered,
//! selected, focused, and activated; a table keeps its columns aligned while a
//! row's state changes; a [`TableHeader`] names those same columns and, for a
//! sortable one, reports a sort request without ever reordering anything
//! itself; a card carries a dominant state on its leading edge, progress on
//! its bottom edge, and a count/alert on its top-trailing corner; a panel is a
//! stable-layout container with a header, grouped actions, and a content
//! region, optionally pointing an anchor notch back at its invoker.
//!
//! [`TableHeader`] and [`TableRow`] share exactly one column-width model — the
//! private `column_spans` helper both call over the shared `row_content_span`
//! leading/trailing reservation — so a header can never drift out of
//! alignment with the rows it names, and a row's own state (a Signal Bead
//! appearing or disappearing) can never shift that same row's columns either.
//!
//! Every visible property resolves from the active [`Theme`] and [`Scale`], and
//! every shared recipe (plate rounding, Signal Bead, Pressure Rail, focus ring)
//! comes from the shared `crate::paint` core rather than a second copy. A
//! control renders state and emits a typed action; it performs no privileged
//! work — the owning service enforces authority. A denied
//! surface keeps its value and shows an Authority Mark rather than collapsing
//! into a plain disabled look (spec §13).

// --- IconTile ----------------------------------------------------------

/// One item of an icon view: a picture with its name beneath it, and no plate
/// of its own (spec §11.34).
///
/// This is the tile a file manager's icon view and the desktop's icon field are
/// made of. A resting tile paints nothing but its picture and its label, so a
/// folder of items reads as a field of pictures over whatever lies behind them
/// — a window's surface, or the desktop wallpaper — rather than as a grid of
/// boxes. That is what separates it from a [`Card`]: a card is a *grouped
/// state-and-actions surface* and wears a plate to bound the group it owns; a
/// tile is one item among many and would only add a box per picture.
///
/// State is what makes a tile paint anything behind its picture:
/// * the pointer wash while hovered or pressed, in the shared plate colours;
/// * the selection fill, the palette's accent at three tenths opacity over the
///   whole tile, rounded like every other plate and laid crisply over a
///   frosted backdrop, so a selected item is plainly the accent while the
///   surface or wallpaper under it still reads through — the pointer washes
///   are different colours entirely, so neither can imitate it. An owner
///   animating a selection draws the mark part-way through
///   [`with_selection_fade`](Self::with_selection_fade);
/// * the keyboard Focus Ring, through the one shared outline every row and tab
///   family draws, so a focused tile reads distinctly from a hovered one. A
///   tile already wearing the selection fill takes no ring on top of it;
/// * the Signal Bead of an authority or recovery state, so a denied or
///   unhealthy item is legible without relying on colour.
///
/// The tile renders state and never dispatches. An icon view lays its tiles out
/// on a geometry it owns and hit-tests pointer input against that same
/// geometry, so a tile holds no pointer position or press latch of its own —
/// unlike a [`ListRow`], which is a control the user clicks directly.
///
/// Equal tiles draw the same pixels, so a host may use `==` as its repaint
/// gate.
