//! The toolbar / toolstrip: [`Toolbar`] (spec §11.11).
//!
//! A toolbar is a strip of tool controls — [`IconButton`]s and
//! [`SplitButton`]s — arranged in groups along one axis: across a window, or,
//! laid out [`ScrollOrientation::Vertical`], down its side as a tool box. It
//! draws the strip's background and the quiet divider between groups,
//! positions each tool, marks the *active* tool with a persistent accent seam —
//! beneath it across a window, along its leading edge down one — and routes
//! pointer and keyboard input to the tool controls it owns (each tool's own
//! Heat Seam, Signal Bead, and pressure rail come from that tool's
//! [`crate::button`] state, so background work shows on the tool, not across
//! the whole strip). Activation is reported as a typed [`ToolbarAction`]; the
//! toolbar enforces no authority. Every metric resolves from the active
//! [`Theme`] and [`Scale`].
//!
//! A strip too short for its tools **scrolls** rather than running off its
//! own edge: it seats whole tools only, reserves one slot at each end for the
//! overflow affordances, and offsets in whole tools through the shared
//! [`crate::scroll`] engine. Nothing is ever painted or hit-tested outside the
//! bounds the owner gave.
