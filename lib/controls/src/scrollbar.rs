//! The scrollbar renderer: the one orientation-parameterized [`ScrollBar`]
//! control (spec §11.28–§11.30). The `ScrollCorner` at a two-bar junction
//! (§11.31) is drawn by the window-manager furniture family.
//!
//! Vertical and horizontal scrollbars are a single behavioural component; the
//! [`ScrollOrientation`] only decides how the shared one-dimensional thumb math
//! ([`crate::scroll`]) maps onto the screen. This module is the *drawn* form of
//! that component: it lays a bar out into a decrement button, a track (before
//! thumb / thumb / after thumb), and an increment button; paints the quiet
//! Scroll Channel, the thumb, and the end-button chevrons from the active
//! [`Theme`] and [`Scale`]; classifies a pointer position; and maps pointer
//! drag, track paging, end-button line steps, the wheel, and arrow/page/home/
//! end keys back to a clamped offset through the shared [`ScrollModel`].
//!
//! The control does **not** keep a private offset beside the owning viewport:
//! it holds the viewport's own [`ScrollModel`] (refreshed by the owner through
//! [`ScrollBar::set_model`]), updates it immediately so a drag reads smoothly,
//! and reports the requested offset as a typed [`ScrollAction`] the owner
//! applies. Every result is clamped and every division guarded, so an empty,
//! non-scrollable, or degenerate bar simply does not move (fail closed).
