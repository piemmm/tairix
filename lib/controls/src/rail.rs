//! The action rail: [`ActionRail`].
//!
//! An action rail is the vertical column of full-width commands a detail
//! surface offers about the thing it is showing — labelled commands, where a
//! [`Toolbar`](crate::toolbar::Toolbar) holds icon tools. Each item *is* a
//! [`Button`], so the rail restates none of a button's plate painting, press
//! feedback, role emphasis, disabled look, or Authority Mark for a denied
//! action; it owns only the stacking geometry, which item the pointer is
//! over, which item holds keyboard focus, routing input to the item under
//! the pointer or in focus, and translating a completed
//! [`ButtonAction`](crate::button::ButtonAction) into a typed [`RailAction`].
//!
//! Items stack top to bottom, each spanning the rail's full width so their
//! labels align, separated by the theme's control gap; an item's height is
//! the button family's own standard control height, never a number the rail
//! invents. When the given bounds are too short for every item, the rail
//! draws as many whole items as fit from the top and omits the rest —
//! hit-testing, rendering, and measurement all walk the one shared layout so
//! a press can never land on an item that was not drawn.
//!
//! A rail anchored beside a scrollable list — its content beside it moving
//! while the rail itself stays put — can light an Edge Wake down its own
//! leading edge with [`ActionRail::with_edge_wake`], so the reader can tell
//! the list has moved even though the anchored column of commands never
//! does.
