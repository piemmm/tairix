//! Shell-surface controls: [`Notification`], [`TaskbarItem`],
//! [`WindowPreview`], and [`TraySignal`] (spec §11.25–§11.27).
//!
//! These are the desktop's *shell* surfaces — the transient message, the
//! icon-bar entry, the window-picker cell, and the notification-area status
//! capsule. Each is a
//! first-class Reactive Alloy control drawn over the shared `crate::paint`
//! core (plate, rail, Heat Seam, Signal Bead) and the shared `lib/theme`
//! tokens, so nothing here restates a visual recipe. A
//! control renders state and emits a typed userland action; the owning
//! service enforces authority, and a denied action reads distinctly from a
//! disabled one (spec §13).
