//! The window-manager furniture family (spec §11.17–§11.23, §11.31).
//!
//! These are the window-manager-owned controls around one client viewport:
//! the [`WindowFrame`] boundary, the [`TitleBar`] with its window commands,
//! the compact [`WindowControl`] buttons (close, minimize, put-to-back,
//! size-toggle), the [`ResizeGrabber`], and the neutral [`ScrollCorner`] at a
//! two-scrollbar junction.
//!
//! The window manager owns frame rendering, hit testing, pointer capture,
//! move and resize, stacking, minimization, and size-state transitions;
//! applications provide typed metadata and receive typed events. The client
//! surface can never receive furniture input: the frame's hit map classifies
//! every point as either client or a specific furniture part, and the resize
//! corner never overlaps a scrollbar thumb.
//!
//! Every visible property resolves from the active [`Theme`] and [`Scale`]
//! through the shared `crate::paint` core (the same plate, rim, focus-ring,
//! press-latch, and keyboard-activation recipe the button family uses); the
//! command glyphs are drawn here once, as `paint::paint_chevron` is. The
//! controls render state and emit typed actions; the window manager enforces
//! authority (a denial reads distinctly from a plain disabled control, spec
//! §13). Nothing here animates, so it is reduced-motion correct by
//! construction — a minimize/size transition is a window-manager animation of
//! geometry, not a property of these controls.

// is), rather than added to the notification-icon set in `lib/icon`: they are
// window-control primitives, not the taskbar's status vocabulary. Each is a
// crisp geometric mark that reads without colour (spec §15): the close cross,
// the minimize bar, the maximize/restore squares, and the put-to-back stacked
// plates, so a monochrome theme still tells the four commands apart.

/// on. A glyph is authored once against this grid and then grid-fitted to the
/// device pixels of whatever box it is drawn in (see [`Glyph`]).

/// `a / b` rounded to the nearest whole number, for a non-negative `a` and a
/// positive `b`.

/// Grid fitting must round, never truncate: truncation drags every fitted
/// coordinate toward the box's leading edge, so a mark authored symmetrically
/// in the design grid comes out off-centre and a stroke authored just under
