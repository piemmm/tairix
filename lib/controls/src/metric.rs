//! The metric-readout family: [`MetricTile`], the at-a-glance card that
//! reports one resource; [`StatusPill`], the compact capsule that names a
//! state; and [`CompositionBar`], the split of a measured whole into its
//! named parts (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`'s System overview resource
//! cards).
//!
//! A metric tile is what a resource becomes when it needs its own bounded
//! card rather than a row in a shared header band: an optional leading icon
//! naming the resource, a quiet label, a large reading with a quieter unit,
//! an optional line of supporting detail, and an optional instrument beneath
//! — either a proportional track, or a [`Chart`] of the resource's recent
//! history. Like those two instruments, a tile is read-only: it carries the
//! facts its owner supplies and never accepts pointer or keyboard input.
//!
//! A tile draws in one of two [`MetricLayout`]s. [`MetricLayout::Stacked`],
//! the default, is the form a tile uses when it owns a column of its own:
//! the label sits above the large reading, exactly as the control has always
//! drawn. [`MetricLayout::Inline`] is the compact single-line form a stack of
//! readings uses when several must fit a narrow column and be scanned down:
//! the label leads, the reading (with its unit) trails, right-aligned on the
//! same line, and the reading keeps the room it needs when the two cannot
//! both fit — the label truncates first, never the reading, because the
//! reading is what the reader came for. Both layouts still draw the optional
//! detail line and instrument beneath, spanning the tile's full width.
//!
//! A tile is plated by default: an Alloy Plate of its own, exactly as before.
//! [`unplated`](MetricTile::unplated) drops that plate, its rim, and its own
//! padding, for a tile that sits inside a container — a [`Panel`
//! ](crate::collection::Panel) — that already provides the surface, so
//! several readings can share one plate without nesting a second one inside
//! it.
//!
//! A composition bar answers a question neither of the other two can: *where
//! did it go*. A track says how much of a resource is in use and a chart says
//! what it has been doing, but neither splits that use into the parts it is
//! made of. The bar draws those parts as one proportional row through the same
//! measured-track geometry a track uses, tinted down one ladder of the
//! resource's own hue so they separate by weight rather than by a second
//! colour vocabulary, and names each one with its amount in a key beneath.
//! Parts that do not sum to the whole are a construction error: a composition
//! that does not account for everything is not one.
//!
//! A status pill fills a gap neither instrument covers: naming a condition —
//! "Healthy", "Denied", "Recovering" — in a compact capsule with no action of
//! its own, for a surface that needs to badge a state without offering a
//! button. It reuses the theme's own [`SignalRole`] vocabulary rather than
//! inventing a second one, so a pill's tone always means the same thing a
//! Pressure Rail or Signal Bead of that role means elsewhere.
//!
//! Every colour, radius, thickness, gap, and font metric resolves from the
//! active [`Theme`] and [`Scale`] through the shared accessors
//! (`crate::paint`), and a tile's embedded track is the one shared
//! groove/fill/outline recipe every measured track in the crate draws from,
//! and its leading icon is the same slot [`Button`](crate::Button)'s
//! [`ButtonContent::Icon`](crate::button::ButtonContent::Icon) draws through,
//! so neither control here carries its own copy of that geometry.
