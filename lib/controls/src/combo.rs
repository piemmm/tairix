//! The choice-entry control: [`ComboBox`] (spec §11.9).
//!
//! A combo box is a field plus a disclosure action: a quiet Alloy Plate showing
//! the currently selected choice with a trailing down chevron, expanding to a
//! [`Menu`] of choices. It composes the text-field focus model (a plate, a
//! focus ring, the spec §13 authority treatment) and the [`Menu`] model for the
//! expanded list rather than re-deriving either: the popup
//! *is* a [`Menu`] built from the choices, so the menu's keyboard navigation,
//! hover, and rendering are reused unchanged. Selection belongs to the choice
//! list, never to string parsing inside the control. Every activation is a
//! typed [`ComboAction`]; the control enforces no authority.
