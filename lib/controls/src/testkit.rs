//! Shared test support for the control-family unit tests.
//!
//! Every family exercises the same two axes — the built-in themes and the
//! heavier-contrast path — so the fixtures they need in common live here once
//! rather than being restated in each family's test module.
//!
//! Compiled in for this crate's own tests and, behind the `test-support`
//! feature, for a downstream crate's tests too — a composition built from
//! these controls exercises the same two axes and must reach for this one
//! fixture rather than growing its own copy.
