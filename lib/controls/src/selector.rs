//! The boolean-selector family: [`Toggle`], [`Checkbox`], and [`Radio`].
//!
//! Each is a labelled boolean control that reads by *shape* as well as colour
//! (spec §11.4–§11.5): a toggle's thumb slides to the active side, a checkbox
//! draws a filled square when on and a horizontal bar when mixed, and a radio
//! draws a centre bead when selected. They share the button family's plate
//! helpers (`crate::paint`) and press/keyboard interaction model rather than a
//! second copy, resolve every colour/metric/radius from the active [`Theme`]
//! and [`Scale`], and emit a typed [`SelectorAction`] on activation — the
//! owning service applies the change and enforces authority. A denied selector
//! keeps its value and shows an Authority Mark rather than silently looking
//! disabled (spec §13).
//!
//! The glyph itself is compact — the theme's `selector_extent`, centred in the
//! row the owner lays the control out in — so the row stays a comfortable hit
//! target and a keyboard focus band while the mark stays small.
