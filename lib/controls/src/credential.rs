//! [`CredentialSheet`]: the one surface that asks for an account and its
//! password so a more-privileged program can be started as that account.
//!
//! Two places on the desktop ask that question — the session, when a command
//! it may not perform is chosen, and the Settings application, when a machine
//! setting is applied by re-running the tool that owns the store — and they
//! may not depend on one another. Two credential surfaces is one too many:
//! the wording, the focus order, the "an empty field is never offered" rule,
//! and the secret's hygiene would each have two places to get wrong.
//!
//! The sheet owns none of that context. It knows nothing of a compositor, a
//! window, an account database, or IPC: an owner gives it events and a
//! rectangle, takes back a painted surface and a [`CredentialAction`], and
//! performs the exchange itself. Whether it is drawn in a window of its own
//! or over a client's content is the owner's business.
//!
//! # The secret
//!
//! The password is typed into a [`SecretField`], which draws the shared
//! secret-entry marker and nothing typed, and holds it in a bounded,
//! pre-reserved buffer that cannot reallocate while filling and zeroises every
//! byte it discards — including on drop. Dropping the sheet therefore leaves
//! no plaintext behind, whichever way the question ended.
