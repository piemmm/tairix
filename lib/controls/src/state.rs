//! The typed control-state vocabulary.
//!
//! Reactive Alloy models a control as a small set of *composed* typed
//! fields, never one giant enum and never an unstructured key/value bag. A
//! disabled destructive recovery button and a focused non-destructive
//! primary button are different *combinations* of small typed states, not
//! unrelated code paths. This module is the one definition of that
//! vocabulary, shared by every control renderer and by the window manager's
//! furniture.
//!
//! # What lives here
//!
//! - [`ControlKind`] and [`ControlRole`] — what a control *is* and the
//!   intent it carries.
//! - [`PlateSeating`] — where a control sits, the one fact that decides
//!   whether it wears a plate and a perimeter of its own.
//! - [`ControlState`] — the composed run-time state of one control, built
//!   from [`FocusState`], [`PointerState`], [`SelectionState`],
//!   [`ValidationState`], [`AuthorityState`], [`ActivityState`],
//!   [`PressureState`], and [`RecoveryState`].
//! - [`ControlDisposition`] — the *derived* authority/interaction taxonomy a
//!   renderer switches on, so a permission denial is never collapsed into a
//!   plain disabled look.
//! - The window-furniture states ([`WindowControlKind`],
//!   [`WindowActivationState`], [`WindowSizeState`], [`WindowFurnitureState`],
//!   and [`SizeAction`]) the window manager paints its frame from.
//!
//! The scroll-range vocabulary the state model refers to
//! ([`ScrollOrientation`](crate::ScrollOrientation),
//! [`ScrollRange`](crate::ScrollRange), [`ScrollModel`](crate::ScrollModel))
//! already lives in [`crate::scroll`]; it is not restated here.
//!
//! # Illegal states are unrepresentable
//!
//! Mutually exclusive facts are enums (a control is hovered *or* pressed,
//! never both); orthogonal facts are separate fields. Known progress carries
//! a validated [`ProgressValue`] that can never exceed full, so a renderer
//! never has to defend against an out-of-range percentage.
//!
//! # The render-gate contract
//!
//! [`RenderInvariant`] marks a field as hit-testing bookkeeping rather than a
//! drawn property, excluding it from the equality a host uses as a *render
//! gate* — see its own rustdoc for the full contract and the obligation it
//! places on the author who reaches for it.

/// # The contract it buys
///
/// Every drawn control in this crate derives `PartialEq`, and a host uses that
/// equality as a *render gate*: it re-renders and re-presents only when the
/// composition it is about to draw differs from the one it last drew. That is
/// sound only if equality means "these two would draw the same pixels", so a
/// control may hold no field that changes without changing the picture. Raw
/// pointer coordinates, press latches, and drag anchors are exactly such
/// fields: they are hit-testing bookkeeping consumed by `on_pointer`, and the
/// *visible* consequence of a press or a hover is a separate, still-compared
/// `ControlState`. Left bare, one pointer sample over inert background would
/// make the whole composition compare as changed and pay a full repaint.
///
/// Wrapping such a field in `RenderInvariant` makes it compare equal to every
/// other value of its type, so it drops out of the surrounding `derive` while
/// every other field keeps its ordinary meaning.
///
/// # Why a wrapper rather than a hand-written `PartialEq`
///
/// The alternative — writing `impl PartialEq` per control and simply omitting
/// the excluded field — has to restate every *remaining* field. A field added
/// later is then silently absent from equality, and a visible change stops
/// forcing a repaint: stale pixels, the failure direction that a test is
/// unlikely to catch. Localising the exception in the *type of the excluded
/// field* inverts that: the struct keeps `#[derive(PartialEq)]`, a new field is
/// covered automatically, and exempting one takes a deliberate, greppable,
/// self-documenting change at the field itself.
///
/// # The obligation on the author
///
/// Wrap a field only with positive evidence that no render path reads it, and
/// prove it with a drift-guard test that renders two values differing only in
/// that field and compares the surfaces byte for byte. The cost of the two
/// mistakes is not symmetric: a field wrongly left bare only costs a needless
/// repaint, while one wrongly wrapped freezes the screen on stale pixels.
///
/// It deliberately implements no `Hash`: equality here is coarser than the
/// wrapped value, so any hash derived from that value would break the
/// `Hash`/`Eq` agreement.
///
/// # A note to a reader from outside this crate
///
/// A host anywhere in the desktop that composes these controls into its own
/// screen — a window manager, the taskbar, or an application — relies on
/// exactly this property when it decides whether to re-present a frame: two
/// equal control trees are two identical pictures, so it is always safe to
/// skip the repaint. Nothing about this contract is specific to any one
/// control family or composition; it holds crate-wide.
