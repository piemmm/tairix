//! The button family: [`Button`], [`IconButton`], and [`SplitButton`].
//!
//! All three are Alloy Plates with a Signal Rim and the optional edge signals
//! (Heat Seam, Pressure Rail, Signal Bead, focus ring) the design language
//! gives a button. They share one visual core (`resolve` + `paint_frame`) and
//! one interaction core (`pointer_activation`/`key_activation`) rather
//! than three copies, so the whole family rounds, tints, and responds
//! identically. Every visible property resolves from the active
//! [`Theme`] and [`Scale`]; the
//! control holds no hard-coded colour, radius, or timing.
