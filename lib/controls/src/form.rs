//! The form-field family: [`FieldRow`] and [`FieldGroup`], the shape every
//! settings surface has (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md` §11.41,
//! `docs/src/lib/controls.md`).
//!
//! A row is one setting: a label, an optional description line, and a trailing
//! slot holding one real [`Toggle`], [`ComboBox`], [`Slider`], [`TextField`],
//! [`Button`], [`FlagSet`] of checkboxes, read-only reading, or stated absence
//! of one. It composes the row chrome [`ListRow`](crate::collection::ListRow)
//! and [`TableRow`](crate::collection::TableRow) paint and restates neither
//! that nor any control. A group is the captioned plate those rows sit on,
//! resolving one slot column so every control in it begins at the same x.
//!
//! Three obligations fall on a caller, and each is what stops a settings pane
//! lying about the machine:
//!
//! - **State a refusal on the row, not the control.**
//!   [`FieldRow::set_state`] shares the row's enablement, authority and
//!   validation with the control in its slot — exactly what decides
//!   actionability — so a denied setting cannot hold an actionable control.
//!   A **disabled** row mutes, a **denied** one wears the Authority
//!   Mark in a bead band that is reserved either way — so it never moves its
//!   own control — and [`FieldControl::Unmeasured`] states why there is no
//!   reading rather than drawing a blank a reader would take for one.
//! - **Give room away in the order the reader needs it**, which the family
//!   does for you: slot, label, description. See [`FieldRow::render`].
//! - **Place the choice popup yourself.** An expanded [`ComboBox`] draws above
//!   every group, so a row cannot paint it — the group's later rows would
//!   cover it. Read [`FieldGroup::popup_anchor`], place the list, hand it back
//!   through [`FieldLayout::with_popup`], and paint it with
//!   [`FieldGroup::render_popup`] once every group is drawn.
