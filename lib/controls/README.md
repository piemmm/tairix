# tairix-controls

Stability tier: **experimental**.

Shared **Reactive Alloy** GUI control behaviour for the TAIRiX desktop
(`lib/controls` — see `plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`).

Reactive Alloy is TAIRiX's GUI control design language: controls are typed
Rust state resolved against the shared theme (`lib/theme`) and drawn through
the shared raster/compositor path (`lib/raster`), with no per-application copy
of a control's behaviour. This crate is the shared home for that behaviour. It
lives in `lib/*` because its consumers — the compositing window manager
(`userland/gui/wm`), the taskbar (`userland/gui/taskbar`), and the default
graphical apps — may not depend on one another, exactly as `lib/geometry` owns
the shared coordinate types and `lib/theme` owns the shared design tokens.

## What lives here today

The first module is the **scroll geometry engine** (`scroll`): the single,
orientation-independent definition of scrollbar behaviour the design language
requires be shared by the window-manager root viewport and by nested
application content, over one range validation, thumb math, and input model —
never separate vertical, horizontal, window-manager, and application recipes.

- `ScrollRange` — a validated content/viewport/offset triple in physical
  pixels. Always normalised: the offset never exceeds `max_offset`, and a
  viewport that covers its content (or a degenerate zero-size viewport) pins
  the offset to zero. Fields are private so the invariant cannot be violated.
- `ScrollModel` — a range plus line-step and page-step distances; the single
  source of truth for the offset, moved by `line_*`/`page_*`/`scroll_by`/
  `scroll_to`/`to_start`/`to_end`/`revealing` and re-clamped by `resize`.
  `in_pixels` steps a view's own row pitch and pages a viewport less a line.
- `ScrollView` — the one mapping between content laid out at its natural size,
  unscrolled, and the window it shows through: a clipped, shifted paint, the
  point and rectangle mappings both ways, damage reporting, and the pointer
  mapping that never lets a control reach the part scrolled out of sight.
- `wheel_steps` — the one conversion from the seat's scroll units
  (`SCROLL_UNITS_PER_DETENT` a detent) to a view's steps, with a carry; a view
  moves `WHEEL_STEP` logical pixels a detent.
- `ScrollGeometry` — turns a range plus a physical track length and the theme's
  minimum thumb length into a `ThumbSpan` (proportional length, mapped
  position), classifies a track coordinate (`hit` → `TrackHit`), and maps a
  thumb position or a pointer drag (with a preserved pointer-to-thumb anchor)
  back to a clamped offset.
- `ScrollOrientation` — vertical/horizontal, a pure layout parameter; the math
  is identical on both axes.

The engine is pure integer arithmetic with no rendering. It works in `u128`
internally so no `u64` extent overflows, and every division is guarded by a
non-zero denominator, so no path panics. Invalid, overflowing, or stale range
data fails closed to a non-draggable, zero-offset scrollbar rather than
producing out-of-bounds geometry.

The **typed control-state vocabulary** (`state`) is the spec §5 model as composed
Rust: `ControlKind`/`ControlRole`, `ControlState` built from small typed fields
(`FocusState`/`PointerState`/`SelectionState`/`ValidationState`/`AuthorityState`/
`ActivityState`/`PressureState`/`RecoveryState`), the derived `ControlDisposition`
that keeps an authority denial distinct from a plain disabled control (spec §13),
the `PlateSeating` a control is drawn with (below), and the window-furniture
states (`WindowControlKind`/`WindowActivationState`/`WindowSizeState`/
`WindowFurnitureState`). Illegal states are unrepresentable and `ProgressValue`
clamps out-of-range input.

**The theme chooses the face, not the caller.** No control accepts a typeface.
A control names the job its text does (a `tairix_theme::TextRole`) and the
active theme answers with the family, size, and weight, converted to physical
pixels through the one shared DPI scale. An application cannot substitute a
face of its own, so a menu drawn inside a monospace terminal is still the
desktop's own menu. An application's *own* content — a document, a terminal
grid — is unaffected; the rule binds the shared controls.

The **button family** (`button`) is the first drawn control family: `Button`,
`IconButton`, and `SplitButton`. Each resolves every colour, metric, and corner
radius from the active `tairix_theme::Theme` and `tairix_geometry::Scale`; rounds
its plate through the shared `tairix_raster::Surface::fill_round_rect` (the one
rounded-rect definition, also used by the window-manager compositor — never a
second rounding path); draws labels through `tairix_font` and icons/marks through
`tairix_icon`; and consumes the shared `tairix_input` pointer/keyboard vocabulary.
Every §11 state is composed from the typed model, dark/light and high-contrast are
theme data, and a control emits only a typed action — the owning service enforces
authority.

The **boolean-selector family** (`selector`) is the second drawn family:
`Toggle`, `Checkbox`, and `Radio`. Each is a labelled boolean control that
reads by *shape* as well as colour (a toggle's thumb slides to the active side
with an accent contact, a checkbox draws a filled square when checked and a
horizontal bar when mixed, a radio draws a centre bead when selected), so its
state is legible without hue. They share the button family's plate, colour,
bead, and interaction helpers (the private `paint` module — the one place the
§13 rim/bead recipe and the plate rounding live), resolve every visible
property from the active theme and scale, draw the shared overlay signals
(Pressure Rail, pending Heat Seam, Authority Mark bead) on top of the glyph,
and emit a typed `SelectorAction` — a denied selector keeps its value and
shows the lock bead rather than looking disabled.

The **value-control family** (`value`) is `Slider` and `Progress`: measured
controls whose value is a validated permille. A `Slider` drags/steps and commits
through its owner (`SliderAction`) with an optional cap marker and resource-tinted
track, reporting its live value while the interaction continues and a distinct
*settled* value when it ends — durable work belongs on the settle alone, because
a drag reports one value per pointer sample. Its knob is the theme's
`slider_knob` size wherever it is seated; it may take only a set of stops
(`with_stops`) and name its two ends (`with_ends`, *Slow* to *Fast*); a `Progress` is a read-only instrument trace (known %, working/
indeterminate segment that freezes under reduced motion, complete/failed). The
**text-entry family** (`text`) is `TextField` and `SearchField` over a pure
caret/selection `TextEditor` with clipped horizontal scroll, emitting a typed
`TextAction`; read-only, disabled, and denied render distinctly. Its credential
member is the **masked entry** `SecretField`, described below; a `SearchField`
has no masked mode, since a query is not a credential. The **number field**
(`number`) is a `TextField` holding an integer between two bounds: live while
its digits spell a number in range, invalid while they do not, stepped by keys
and a focused field's wheel, and settled by a step, Enter, or its owner's
commit as the focus leaves.

The **colour controls** are `SwatchGrid` (`swatch_grid`), a grid of wells with
a primary mark on at most one and an optional secondary one, and `ColourPicker`
(`colour_picker`): one colour picked on a square, a wheel or sliders
(`PickerView`), an opacity strip where it has one, a swatch beside the earlier
colour a press takes back, a hex field and number fields in one model —
RGB, HSV, HSL, CMYK, Lab, `LCh` or grey (`ColourModel`, `colour_model`), its
values held as typed — beside the view in wide bounds and beneath it in narrow
ones, giving up its fields before its view when short. It holds `lib/colour`'s exact coordinates, so grey and black
keep the hue and saturation shown, and it reports `PickerOutcome::Edited` live
and `PickerOutcome::Settled` once, as a slider does.

The **command surfaces** are the menu, toolbar, tab strip, and combo box:

- `menu` — `MenuItem` rows and the elevated `Menu` plate (icon column,
  accelerator caption, submenu chevron, destructive danger rail, §13 Signal
  Bead; current-row highlight distinct from a keyboard focus ring). A row
  carries no help text: why a row cannot be chosen is `ChainRow::explained`,
  shown as the seat's tooltip on dwell, because a caption beside every
  disabled label made a plate as wide as its longest excuse. An ordinary
  row's highlight is the `surface_selected` band — a shade of the surface
  rather than the accent hue, but laid **solid**, because it is the mark that
  says which row will act and a mark diluted by the wallpaper leaves it no
  heavier than the rest of a floating plate. A destructive or recovery row
  keeps its own emphasis colour, equally solid; only a *non-actionable*
  current row stays a quiet background, so it can never masquerade as an
  available action. The `Menu`
  owns Up/Down/Home/End/Right/Enter/Space/Escape and pointer hover/click, sizes
  itself (`preferred_width`/`preferred_height`), and emits a typed `MenuAction`.
  It also carries `plate_rect` — the one rule that places a plate against a
  `PlatePlacement` — and `ChainModel`, the one *model* every menu the desktop
  renders is built as: a titled, parent-indexed list of `ChainRow`s, which a
  desktop surface builds in process and an application's wire declaration
  decodes into (`ChainModel::from_app_menu`). The model lives here rather than
  with the chain that renders it because its clients are not all in the process
  that owns the chain (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §1.6).
- `toolbar` — `Toolbar` composes `IconButton`/`SplitButton` tools in `u16`
  groups (raised strip, group dividers, active-tool accent seam), one to a line
  or several side by side (`with_lanes`, a two-column tool box), routing
  pointer/keyboard input to the tools it owns and emitting a typed
  `ToolbarAction`.
- `tabs` — `Tab`/`Tabs`, an equal-width strip whose selected tab carries a
  strong lower seam, loading a Heat Seam, and modified/error a shape-coded bead;
  it emits a typed `TabsAction`. Where the pointer rests and where the keyboard
  cursor is are two separate records — both lift a tab, only the keyboard's is
  ringed — so a host re-stating its keyboard focus, which a monitoring host does
  on every refresh, cannot erase a resting pointer's highlight. A host whose
  entries come and go adopts each sample through `Tabs::restate`, which keeps
  where the pointer is and which entry holds a press rather than replacing the
  strip and forgetting both.
- `combo` — `ComboBox` composes the text-field focus model and the `Menu` model
  (its popup *is* a `Menu`), opening/selecting/closing by pointer and keyboard
  and emitting a typed `ComboAction`; its field washes and presses under the
  pointer through the shared press model, as a button's plate does.

A list whose sections open in place — a tab strip's disclosing entries, a
program catalog's folders — keeps its state in `disclosure`'s `DisclosureSet`
(each section moves on its own, never as an accordion) and answers Right and
Left through `tree_step`, the one rule for what they do in such a list.

The shared chevron and focus-ring/cell-outline primitives live once in the
private `paint` module (`ChevronDir`/`paint_chevron`, `draw_outline`), so no
family carries its own triangle or outline recipe.

## Plate seating: a panel or a bar

`PlateSeating` says where a control is seated, which decides whether it wears
chrome of its own. It is a property of the *surface behind the control*, never
of what the control is or what it is doing:

- `Panel` (the default) — the control always wears its Alloy Plate and Signal
  Rim, reading as a plate raised above the window or panel behind it.
- `Bar` — the control wears **no** rim in any state, and no plate at all while
  it has nothing of its own to state, so a run of icons reads as one continuous
  bar instead of a row of boxed buttons.

One state model, one renderer, and one resolved set of colours serve both
seatings; the whole consequence is a single shared rule
(`paint::FrameColors::face`), so no family can grow its own idea of a flat
control. Nothing is discarded, only moved off the edge: a hover raises the
shared pointer wash (`surface_hover`) and a press compresses it — the only
pointer feedback a rimless control has, which is why `tairix-theme` guarantees
the wash a visible step from the bar's fill — keyboard focus keeps the resting
fill and still draws its ring (a bare frame is by construction never a focused
one), and a denied/failed/pending/disabled control states itself on its glyph
tint and shape-coded bead rather than a coloured edge. Focus Field membership is
the one signal a bar-seated control cannot make, since membership is drawn only
as a rim lift; the icon strip has no such groups.

`IconButton` carries the choice (`IconButton::seated`) because it is the only
family that appears on both a window toolbar and the desktop's icon strip.
`shell::TaskbarItem` and `shell::TraySignal` exist only on the bar and are
bar-seated by construction; every other family is panel-seated.

A focused control shows **exactly one accent line, and it is the ring**, a
border inside the plate. The perimeter keeps its quiet resting rim — under the
pointer too, where a hover would otherwise lift it — because a ring with a
second accent edge around it reads as a doubled border. Focus is told from
hover by *where* the line sits, not by its colour, and the pointer still states
itself in the plate wash. A rim carrying a role or a disposition (a destructive
edge, a pending check) is that control's own statement and keeps it.

## Surface ground: opaque, floating chrome, or a frosted window

The **ground** is seating's counterpart: whether the backgrounds drawn with a
theme cover what is behind them or let it through. `tairix_theme::SurfaceGround`
rides on the theme a surface is drawn with (`Theme::floating`, `Theme::frosted`,
reported by `Theme::ground`) rather than on each control, so everything drawn on
one surface agrees and none can be forgotten and left an opaque patch. `Opaque`
(the default) draws the palette's own colours; `Floating` — desktop chrome over
a backdrop the compositor blurs — keeps each background's colour role and takes
the palette's chrome alpha for its layer, so a floating surface preserves the
relationships the theme authored (a `Menu` still grounds in `surface_raised`, a
`Panel` in `surface`); `Frosted` — an application window cut from the same
glass — lets its own ground through at `chrome_alpha` and keeps everything laid
on it solid, rows included.

`ground_fill(theme, fill, layer)` is that one rule, and `ChromeLayer` the only
choice at a call site: `Ground` for the surface's own ground; `Inlay` for a
background laid flush into it (a list row, a menu row, a sidebar entry, a
scrollbar channel, a heading band), the ground's weight on floating chrome so a
resting row is exactly its ground rather than a patch on it, and solid on a
frosted window; `Plate` for a control raised on it (a button, a text field, a
page tab, a card, a settings group), furniture on the glass rather than a hole
cut in it — a step more solid on floating chrome, solid on a frosted window. A
row takes the layer of what it sits on, so a setting row is `Plate`: part of
the card it is listed on. Only backgrounds pass through it — a semantic mark (a
role fill, a menu's *warning* or *danger* command, a pressure rail, a bead, a
focus ring,
a control's own Signal Rim) stays solid, because it must read against whatever
wallpaper is behind it; a *surface's* rim is its edge rather than a mark on it,
so it takes the surface's own layer and reads as the same glass a step lighter
(a step darker on a light theme), and a solid card's edge is solid. And a background is **laid down**, never
composited: composited over
the pass beneath it a translucent fill would come back more opaque than the
theme authored and frost nothing, while an opaque colour covers either way —
the same byte wherever the shape fully covers a pixel, one rounding rather than
two on a corner arc. One translucent layer per surface follows: a floating
`Panel` draws no header band and states its header with the rail and title it
already has.

`paint_surface_plate` (rim ring, then the ground inside it, reporting the
interior) and `plate_border` (the desktop's one rim thickness) are public: the
taskbar is such a surface without being a control here, and it must not invent
a second edge recipe.

## Owner-supplied icon artwork

A `shell::TaskbarItem`, a `collection::IconTile`, a `collection::ListRow`, and
a `button::IconButton` each draw an icon whose artwork their owner may already
hold rasterised (a desktop icon cache, an app bundle's own icon). They share one
seam: `icon_side(bounds, scale, theme, …)` reports the exact pixel side the
icon slot will be drawn into (`0` when the geometry leaves room for none; an
icon tile answers through its `TileLayout`), so the
owner can ask its cache for artwork at precisely that size; `render(…,
artwork: Option<&Surface>)` then blits that artwork centred in the slot, or
rasterises the control's built-in vector glyph when none is supplied. A
missing, refused, or undecodable asset therefore degrades to a meaningful icon
rather than a blank slot.

The "blit the artwork, else draw the built-in glyph" rule lives **once**, in
the private `paint` module (`paint_icon_slot`), so the four controls cannot
drift apart. Artwork that does not match the slot is centred on it rather than
pinned to a corner, and a control with no icon slot ignores the parameter. No
control decodes an image: artwork arrives already decoded and rasterised
through the desktop's sandboxed asset path, so a malformed file can only fail
to produce artwork.

## A selected icon tile: the accent over a frosted backdrop

`collection::IconTile` wears no plate of its own, so a selection has to be
drawn behind the picture — over the tile's **body**
(`TileLayout::body_rect`: its picture and its name's drawn lines, each with
half an inset of margin), which is also what a press and a marquee must touch,
so the cell around it stays ground. A tile `with_name_cut` cuts a long name in
its middle so its extension shows, and one `with_picture_shadow` casts the
theme's small soft shadow under its picture. What it blurs is the **backdrop**: the pixels the
tile covers — a window's surface, the desktop wallpaper — are frosted by the
scaled `selection_backdrop_blur` through `tairix_raster`'s one shared region
frost, the same call the compositor frosts a window's backdrop with, and the
theme's `selection_fill` — the accent at three tenths opacity — is then laid over them
with a **crisp** edge, rounded like every other control plate. Frost and fill
are confined to that one rounded shape, so nothing lands outside the tile's
bounds and no square edge shows around the rounded fill. Softening the *fill*
instead is what left the mark a smear with no shape of its own. Only a selected
tile pays for it.

The radius is deliberately short, and the tests bracket it from both sides
rather than pin it. A box blur of radius `r` averages `2r + 1` samples, so a
radius approaching the tile's own size averages its whole backdrop to a single
colour: the mark then reads as a smudge with an accent cast and the wallpaper
behind it is simply gone. One test renders over a one-pixel pattern and
requires the fine grain to collapse; its pair renders over a broad one and
requires the shapes to survive — measured across the *middle* of the tile,
because the frost stops at the tile's edge and replicates the pixel there, so
the outermost columns keep their own colour at any radius and would answer for
a backdrop that had been averaged away.

`with_selection_fade` draws the mark at a given strength, `0` to `u8::MAX`, so
an owner can cross-fade a selection between items over the theme's
`MotionInteraction::SelectionChange` duration. It scales the frost and the fill
together, so a backdrop never snaps into focus ahead of the colour leaving it.
The item being left is already unselected while its mark decays, and the item
arrived at is already selected while its mark grows, so the strength is the
owner's to state rather than the composed state's to infer. A host that does
not animate sets nothing and the mark follows the selection. Under a heavier
`Contrast` the mark does not fade at all — see below.

The fill is translucent, so the wallpaper or window surface still reads through
it and the name keeps the theme's ordinary foreground: near-white on-accent ink
over a light theme's pale-orange result would wash out, while the theme's own
foreground separates either way up. Under a heavier `Contrast` the tile fills
the crisp opaque accent panel and inverts its ink to `on_accent`, the instant
the item is selected rather than fading in: a translucent wash would trade away
the very contrast that policy exists to add, and a half-arrived plate under
inverted ink would too. Hover and press keep their own crisp washes in the
shared plate colours — never the accent — so a pointer can never imitate a
selection.

A **selected** tile draws neither the pointer wash nor the focus ring, whatever
strength its mark is currently at. Both are suppressed by the selection itself
rather than by the strength, because an outline that appeared for as long as a
mark took to arrive read as a border flickering on and off under the pointer.
The ring is what distinguishes a *focused* tile from a hovered one, so an
unselected tile still takes it.

A tile's geometry is its `TileLayout`: the owner states how many name lines
the band under the picture holds, the band sits half an inset below the picture
and above the tile's foot, and the picture takes the height that leaves, capped
by the width. `TileLayout::height_for(side, …)` is the cell height that seats a
`side`-pixel picture, and `icon_side`, `label_lines` and `label_rect` read the
same geometry the render lays out to, so an owner never re-derives it. The
name, set in `TextRole::ItemLabel`, wraps rather than being cut: each line
centred, the last elided with the shared ellipsis when the name runs past the
stated lines; a band too short for one whole line draws nothing rather than
clipping a glyph.

`with_label_shadow` draws that name — the eliding ellipsis included — through
`lib/font`'s one soft shadow, every line's shadow laid before any line's ink,
for a tile whose ground is a picture rather
than a colour the theme knows: a resting tile paints no plate, so the login
chooser's account names sit straight on the wallpaper. A tile that sets none
draws exactly the pixels it always did.

## Masked text entry

`SecretField::new(max_bytes)` is the password/passphrase/PIN entry. It shares
the plate, rim, focus ring, validation rim, Authority Mark, read-only, disabled
and denied rendering, and high contrast of every text field. There is
deliberately no way to reveal the buffer through the control.

**It shows the console's marker, never the secret.** Once a character is in,
the field reads `[input active.]`, its dots cycling on the cadence every
text-mode password prompt uses (`tairix_vt::secret`), and `[input complete]`
once the secret is submitted. Neither the characters nor how many there are
reach the screen — not even the length a row of beads would give away. An
empty field shows its placeholder: a placeholder is not a secret.

**Its editing is the line discipline's.** A printable character appends,
Backspace erases the last, Enter submits and Escape cancels. Nothing moves the
caret or selects, because an edit nobody can see is one nobody can check, and
the first edit after a submission begins a new secret. A key reports damage
only when it changes the marker, so neither the damage nor the presents it
causes count the characters.

**It is bounded in bytes, and refuses an entry past the bound whole.** The
bound is the unit every wire and the verifier count
(`tairix_abi::account::MAX_PASSWORD_LEN` for an account's password). What is
typed past it is counted, not stored and not dropped: `secret()` answers
`None` until it is erased again, so an entry longer than any credential can
be is never offered as its prefix.

**The owner keeps the time.** Each key arrives as a `Keystroke` stamped on the
owner's monotonic clock; the owner parks no later than `deadline_ns` and calls
`advance` once it passes, which answers whether the field must be repainted.
Under reduced motion the marker stands still, keeping no deadline to replay
once motion returns.

**The buffer is reserved once, up front.** A `String` that grows moves its
contents to a new allocation and releases the old block with the characters
typed so far still in it — a copy of the credential no later erase can reach.
The field reserves its whole bound at construction and never takes a byte
that does not fit in what it reserved, so there is only ever one copy to
erase; a buffer whose room could not be had takes nothing.

**Discarded bytes are erased.** Every path that drops buffer content —
Backspace, replacing the text, overwriting a selection, clearing, truncating
to the bound, and the editor's `Drop` — overwrites the bytes it discards
first, and a removal that moves the tail down also erases the positions the
tail vacates, where a copy of it would otherwise outlive the buffer. The erase
is the workspace's shared `tairix_util::secret::wipe`, not a plain `fill(0)`:
nothing reads those bytes back, so an ordinary store is dead by the language's
own rules and a release build may delete it outright, leaving the plaintext in
the released block. The erase applies to a plain field too — it is cheap,
harmless, and one editor is better than two. A `SecretField`'s `Debug` output
and its equality say nothing of what it holds, not even its length.

## Equality is render equivalence

Every control in this crate compares equal exactly when the two values
**would draw the same pixels**. That is a deliberate contract, not an accident
of `#[derive(PartialEq)]`, and a consumer may rely on it: a host that holds
the surface it last drew can compare the one it is about to draw against it
and skip the render and the window present entirely when they match. A
comparison costs microseconds where a full render plus a window repaint costs
milliseconds, so this is the difference between a desktop that stays
responsive under a moving pointer and one that does not.

Controls also carry state that exists only for hit testing — the last raw
pointer coordinate, the press latch that remembers where a button-down landed
(a card's body press among them), a scrollbar's drag anchor. None of it reaches
`render`, so counting it as a difference would defeat the contract: a pointer
sample crossing no control would look like a change. Such a field is wrapped in
`RenderInvariant<T>` (see `src/state.rs`), a transparent newtype whose own
`PartialEq` always compares equal. The exception therefore lives in the
*type of the excluded field*, so each struct keeps its `derive` and a field
added later is covered automatically — where a hand-written `PartialEq` per
struct could silently forget one.

Visible state stays in equality: a hover highlight, a pressed appearance, a
focus ring, a selection, and a scrollbar's `dragging`/`held` (which it draws)
all make two values unequal, because they make them look different. Every
exclusion carries a drift guard in the tests: two values differing *only* in
that field are rendered and their pixels compared byte for byte, so the
exclusion is proved rather than asserted.

## Reporting what changed

Equality answers *whether* a surface changed; it cannot say *where*. Every
input call therefore takes a damage sink (`&mut tairix_geometry::Region`, from
`damage::sink()`) and pushes the rectangles it repainted into it, so a host
renders and presents those instead of the window. A pointer crossing a
control-rich window costs the control left and the control entered, not the
surface.

Two guarded writes are the whole rule, so nothing invents a third — and they are
public, because a host reports its own drawn changes through the same two:
`damage::set` writes one drawn field and reports the bounds it is drawn in when
the value actually changed, and `damage::move_mark` reports the two children a
mark moves between — the menu row a highlight leaves and the one it arrives on,
the hovered tab, the focused crumb, the focused header column, the sorted column,
a host's own keyboard focus — never the strip, popup, or window around them. The
mark is compared whole, so the same child marked differently (a sort caret
turning over) is still a changed child. A `RenderInvariant` field reports nothing,
exactly as it compares equal, which is why a motion sample inside one control is
free.

A control reports every drawn change it makes itself. Two kinds of change are
the *host's* to report, because only the host knows where it put the controls:

- **A value it commits back into a control.** A control never mutates its own
  committed value: it reports an action and the owner writes the value in
  (`Toggle::set_on`, `Slider::set_value`, `Radio::set_selected`, …). The owner
  holds that control's rectangle at exactly that moment, so it reports it. The
  value is drawn inside it, so nothing narrower is available and nothing wider
  is needed.
- **A mark of its own that moves between two controls.** Keyboard focus is the
  one every host has: each control's ring is a function of the host's own focus
  field, so `damage::move_mark` over that field reports the control the ring
  left and the control it arrives on. A focus that lands on the host's own
  chrome maps to `None`, and the chrome reports its own pixels.

The exception is a mark a *container* draws on one of its own children, whose
two rectangles only that container can name: `Breadcrumb::set_focus`,
`TableHeader::set_focus`, `TableHeader::set_sort`, `Tabs::set_current`,
`Tabs::set_selected` and `Menu::set_current` therefore take the layout the host
already renders and hit-tests with, and report.

A host that is *composing or rebuilding* a control has no layout to resolve a
child against and nothing to report against either, because it presents that
surface whole. It says so, rather than passing a rectangle it does not have:
`adopt_focus`, `adopt_sort`, `adopt_current` and `adopt_selected` adopt the mark
without reporting, and each shares the one admission rule with its reporting
sibling so a rebuild cannot admit a mark the interactive path would refuse.
Passing a fabricated rectangle, scale, or theme to the reporting form is the
alternative, and it is forbidden — a made-up theme is one read away from being
silently wrong.

Over-covering is safe, under-covering is not: a rectangle reported that did not
change costs one redundant repaint, while a change left unreported leaves a
stale pixel on screen. Where the two pull against each other — a disabled
control tracking a hover it does not draw — the report stands.

## Painting only what the surface will keep

A report is worth nothing if the render walks the whole surface anyway. A clip
window withholds a control's *writes* but not its composition — measuring a
label, eliding it, rasterising a glyph, all of which happen before the first
write — so every `render` opens with the shared gate and returns at once when
the surface admits no pixel of its `bounds`:

```rust
if withheld(surface, bounds) {
    return;
}
```

Measured over forty composed list rows: a repaint scoped to one row cost
838 µs before the gate and 25 µs after, against 1.1 ms for the whole list
(`cargo xtask bench --filter controls`). Three fifths of a whole render is
composition, and it used to survive any clip.

The gate rests on one obligation, which is the whole set's: **a family paints
inside the `bounds` it is given and nowhere else.** `paint_tests` asserts it,
and the byte-identity of a band-clipped paint against the same band of a whole
one, over every family in one table — so a family added later joins both. A
family drawn *below* a documented floor of its own is not held to it (a title
band narrower than `TitleBar::min_band_width` abuts its clusters by design);
the table names the rectangle each family is contracted to be drawn in.

An application drawing its own content takes the same gate — `withheld` is
public — and fills or composites a logical rectangle with `fill_area` and
`blend_area`, so no application converts a `Rect` into surface pixels, or
skips a rectangle that starts off the surface, in a copy of its own.

## Where it sits

`#![no_std]`. The `scroll` and `state` modules are pure logic with no
dependencies; the drawn controls (`button`, `selector`, `value`, `text`, `menu`,
`toolbar`, `tabs`, `combo`) depend only on other `lib/*`
crates — `tairix-geometry`, `tairix-theme`, `tairix-raster`, `tairix-font`,
`tairix-icon`, `tairix-input`, `tairix-util` (the shared secret erase a masked
entry discards its buffer through), `tairix-vt` (the secret-entry marker and
its cadence, shared with every console password prompt) and `tairix-abi` (the
menu row id an
outcome names, and the bounded wire menu `ChainModel` decodes) — never on
`kernel/*`,
`drivers/*`, or `userland/*`, so the crate stays a shared building block the
desktop consumers depend on and never the reverse. The owning viewport maps the
computed one-dimensional `ThumbSpan` onto a `tairix_geometry::Rect` for its
orientation at the edge.

The remaining drawn families are also complete: the value controls
(`value` — `Slider`/`Progress`), the text entries (`text` — `TextField`/
`SearchField`), the collection controls (`collection` — `ListRow`/`TableRow`/
`TableCell`/`TableHeader`/`IconTile`/`Card`/`Panel`), the scrollbar renderer
(`scrollbar` — the one orientation-parameterized `ScrollBar` over the `scroll`
engine), the window-manager furniture (`window` — `WindowFrame`/`TitleBar`/
`WindowControl`/`ResizeGrabber`/`ScrollCorner`), the shell surfaces (`shell` —
`Notification`/`TaskbarItem`/`TraySignal`), the decision surfaces
(`decision` — `Dialog`/`Tooltip`/`HelpTip`, with `Dialog::save_changes`, the
one question a document window asks before closing over changes, whose actions
`SaveChanges::of` reads), and the form fields
(`form` — `FieldRow`/`FieldGroup`, the one settings-form shape, composing
the `collection` row chrome — never its pointer wash, which is the slot
control's alone — and a real control in each row's slot, a
`FlagSet` of labelled checkboxes among them; `stack` is the one plate column
its groups are stacked down), the picture choice (`picture` —
`PictureChoice`, a one-of-several setting chosen by its picture, seated in a
`FieldGroup` beneath its rows), the colour wells (`swatch_grid` —
`SwatchGrid`, a grid of wells with a primary and an optional secondary mark,
chosen by pointer or arrow keys, a translucent well shown over the one
`checker` — `Checker` — every surface shows transparency over), and the
credential question (`credential` — `CredentialSheet`, the one surface that
asks for an account and its password so a more-privileged program can be
started as that account: the desktop session's prompt window and the settings
application's in-window sheet compose the same focus order, wording and
secret hygiene).

An application's *screen* is not here. This crate holds only behaviour any
surface may reuse, so a composition that arranges these controls into one
particular window — the Switchboard screen (design spec §17), which lives in
`userland/gui/switchboard/src/view/` — belongs to the application that owns
it. The shared heavier-contrast test fixture is reachable from such a crate
through the `test-support` feature (`tairix_controls::testkit`), so an
application's own render tests exercise the same two contrast axes as the
controls without a second copy of the fixture.

## Reading a system out, and standing beside a list

A monitoring surface reports state without acting on it, and these families
are what it reports through — each one generic, so no application draws its
own readout:

- `metric` — `MetricTile`, one at-a-glance report of a resource: a quiet
  label, a large reading with a quieter unit, an optional detail line, and an
  optional `MetricInstrument` beneath it (`None`, a `Track` proportional to the
  current level over the shared `MeterValue` (`state`), or a `Trend`
  `Chart` of its recent history — never two instruments for one number).
  `MetricLayout` picks the anatomy: `Stacked` puts the label above the reading
  for a tile with a column of its own, `Inline` puts the label leading and the
  reading trailing so a narrow stack of readings can be scanned down. A tile
  takes no input and reports nothing back. `StatusPill` is the compact capsule
  that names a state in a word, toned by its signal role, where a full tile
  would not fit.
- `record` — `FactList`, a column of key/value readouts with the values
  right-aligned on one another, where the value keeps its room and the label
  truncates first, so a narrow detail pane loses a word of description rather
  than a digit; and `Timeline`, a spine spanning only its first to its last
  mark, with shape-coded `EventMark`s and a stamp column sized to the widest
  stamp, so one kind of event reads differently from another without colour.
- `nav` — `Breadcrumb`, the location trail whose trailing crumb is where the
  reader is and is deliberately not activatable, eliding oldest-first through
  one activatable ellipsis so the current location is never the crumb dropped.
- `rail` — `ActionRail`, the vertical counterpart of `Toolbar`: a column of
  `Button` commands anchored beside content, so plate, role, disabled, and
  denied rendering are not restated per surface. A rail lights the Edge Wake
  down its own leading edge (`with_edge_wake`) while the content beside it is
  scrolled away from its start, so a still frame shows that the list moved
  under an anchored column rather than the column moving with the list.
- `collection::Card` — the grouped state-and-actions surface a master list of
  causes, faults, or jobs is made of, and the one control that reports *two*
  interactions: `CardAction::FooterActivated` for a completed click on one of
  its footer `Button`s, and `CardAction::Pressed` for a completed click on the
  card's own body, clear of every footer button. The footer sees each event
  first, so a click can never report both, and a master/detail screen selects
  the pressed card rather than needing a click target of its own. A press gives
  the card no wash: choosing a card is the owner marking it *selected*, so the
  body pointer position and press latch are hit-test state excluded from
  equality (above), and a card that is disabled or denied by authority reports
  nothing at all — the body press runs through the same fail-closed latch every
  clickable control shares. `footer_rects` is the one definition of where the
  footer buttons are, so a composer embedding a card reads the same rectangles
  the card hit-tests and paints.
- `collection::TableHeader` — sortable column titles over the same
  column-width model `TableRow` lays its cells out with, reporting the sort
  its owner commits rather than reordering anything itself. Header and row
  reserve the *same* fixed leading rail gutter and the *same* fixed trailing
  Signal Bead band, both sized from the surface alone, so a row that becomes
  denied or gains a recovery mark keeps every column exactly where the header
  names it — a bead paints inside a band that is always reserved.
- `collection::TableRow::cell_rects` — where a row's cells are laid out, in
  the coordinate space of the bounds it is asked about, derived from the very
  span `render` draws with. A composer placing its own content inside a column
  (a sparkline beside a number) reads the layout instead of re-deriving it, so
  the answer cannot drift from the paint.
- `collection::TableCell` — an optional leading `IconKind` naming what the
  cell's value *is*, taken the way `MetricTile` takes one, drawn on a fixed
  slot ahead of the text at every alignment and out of the text's own budget.
  A column too narrow to seat it omits it rather than overlapping the text,
  and it never moves a column boundary.
- `tabs::TabsOrientation` — a vertical orientation of the existing strip, so a
  sidebar of pages is the one selection control rather than a second one.
- `block` — the titled block a monitoring surface is laid out in: `plate`
  draws its plate and answers the inner rect, `title` and `bare_title` its
  heading (cut with the shared mark where it does not fit), and
  `titled_content` / `content_rect` where its content goes. The Switchboard's
  sections and the System Monitor screensaver's panels share this one anatomy.

## Staged work

The Reactive Alloy control set is complete. The remaining work is the
window-manager / taskbar / app consumers adopting these shared controls.
