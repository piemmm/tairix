//! Shared pointer-cursor library (`lib/cursor`).
//!
//! The desktop's cursors are richer than a one-bit fill mask: each is a
//! small stack of filled, coloured [`Shape`]s over a resolution-independent
//! design grid (a [`VectorCursor`]), so the same definition rasterises
//! crisply at any scale, carries real colour and alpha, and — being pure
//! geometry — is replaceable with an entirely different cursor set.
//!
//! Crisp at every scale, not only the one a set was drawn for: rasterising
//! fits the artwork to the pixel grid of the side asked for, so its straight
//! edges land on pixel boundaries, and draws the cursor's declared
//! [`Outline`] a whole number of pixels wide around it.
//!
//! Like `lib/geometry`, `lib/theme`, `lib/raster`, and `lib/font`, this crate
//! lives in `lib/*` so the window manager and the default apps use it without
//! depending on one another. It owns no colour
//! arithmetic of its own: rasterising a cursor composites through
//! `lib/raster`'s single premultiplied-alpha path, and it
//! names cursors by `lib/theme`'s [`CursorKind`] rather than inventing a
//! second vocabulary.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! [`CursorTheme`] binds one [`VectorCursor`] to each [`CursorKind`];
//! [`CursorRegistry`] holds the available sets and the active one and lets
//! the running system swap the whole pointer look at runtime. A screen
//! resolves a kind to a cursor, rasterises it at the pixel side the display
//! density and the user's chosen pointer size call for, and places the
//! resulting [`CursorImage`] as a [`PlacedCursor`], which puts the hotspot
//! on the pointer and samples the artwork for a draw loop. [`store`] is
//! where the sets a running desktop offers are discovered from.
//!
//! ```
//! use tairix_cursor::{CursorRegistry, CursorImage};
//! use tairix_theme::CursorKind;
//!
//! let cursors = CursorRegistry::with_builtin();
//! let arrow = cursors.active_cursor(CursorKind::Arrow);
//!
//! // Render at the reference side and at 2x for a high-DPI display.
//! let native: CursorImage = arrow.rasterise(32).expect("renderable");
//! let hidpi: CursorImage = arrow.rasterise(64).expect("renderable");
//! assert_eq!(hidpi.width(), native.width() * 2);
//! ```
