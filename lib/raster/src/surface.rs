//! A premultiplied-alpha pixel buffer.
//!
//! A [`Surface`] is a rendered CPU pixel buffer: the content of one
//! window for the compositor, or the painted body of the taskbar. It is
//! a dense row-major array of [`Pixel`]s with no padding; a consumer
//! places it on screen at an origin and blends it through [`Pixel::over`].
//!
//! Painting is confined by a clip window ([`Surface::with_clip`]): a view
//! bounds what it draws to the area it owns — an item grid confines its tiles
//! to its item area — by stating that bound once, rather than every drawing
//! routine trimming its own geometry to an edge.
//!
//! A surface can also *be* one rectangle of a larger drawing
//! ([`Surface::with_origin`]): the paint works in the drawing's coordinates
//! and the buffer holds only the part it covers. That is what renders a strip
//! of a drawing into a buffer the size of the strip, instead of into one the
//! size of the whole drawing.
//!
//! [`Surface::frost_region`] is the shared frosted glass: one rectangle
//! blurred in place and mixed back over itself at a caller-supplied
//! coverage.
