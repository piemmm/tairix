//! The one scan converter every filled shape goes through.
//!
//! A shape reaches here as a set of closed contours in integer coordinates,
//! and leaves as a per-pixel alpha: what the
//! [`Surface`](crate::surface::Surface) fill entry points composite. Solid
//! artwork, grid-fitted device-space chrome, and a multi-contour SVG path are
//! the same problem, so there is one converter rather than one per caller.
//!
//! # Coverage is the area, not a sample count
//!
//! A pixel's alpha is the *exact fraction of its area* the shape covers. Point
//! sampling instead quantises both the answer and the edge's position, which
//! reads as soft, lopsided artwork — a shape symmetric about its centre comes
//! out asymmetric — and downscaled icons, a 256-unit drawing in twenty-odd
//! pixels with strokes a fraction of a pixel wide, show it plainly.
//!
//! The area is accumulated the way FreeType's grey rasteriser does it. Each
//! pixel of a row owns two signed accumulators: `cover`, the vertical extent
//! of the edges crossing it, and `area`, twice the trapezoid area those edges
//! cut off to their left. One left-to-right sweep carrying the running `cover`
//! yields every pixel's signed coverage, which the [`FillRule`] turns into
//! alpha. Nothing is sorted and each edge is visited once per row it touches,
//! so a row costs its edges plus its pixels rather than a sorted pass per
//! sample row.
//!
//! Every coordinate is integer, so a shape rasterises identically on every
//! target. Vertices are clamped to a bound far outside any allocatable surface
//! on the way in, which keeps every product well inside `i64` and makes the
//! whole converter total for adversarial input.
