//! The desktop's one image resampler: a separable, integer, filtered
//! resample of straight-alpha RGBA8 pixels.
//!
//! Two consumers scale decoded images: the icon pipeline fits a bundle's
//! artwork into a square slot, and the wallpaper pipeline places a
//! photograph onto a screen. Both want the same arithmetic — reconstruct a
//! continuous image from the source samples, band-limit it to what the
//! destination grid can carry, and weight the colour channels by alpha so a
//! transparent neighbour cannot bleed its colour into an opaque pixel — so
//! that arithmetic lives here once rather than beside each caller.
//!
//! # The filter
//!
//! Resampling is reconstruction followed by prefiltering, and which of the
//! two dominates is decided entirely by the ratio between the source extent
//! and the destination extent on that axis. This resampler therefore uses
//! the one kernel that is correct for the direction it is going, per axis:
//!
//! - **Reducing** (more source samples than destination samples) the
//!   prefilter dominates: a destination sample is the exact integral of the
//!   source over the footprint it covers, with *fractional* weights on the
//!   two partly-covered end samples. That is the area average, and it is
//!   aliasing-free at every ratio. Weighting the end samples by their real
//!   coverage is what matters: a filter that instead averaged whole samples
//!   would take one source sample for some destination pixels and two for
//!   the next at a ratio of, say, 1.4, and that alternation is visible as
//!   hard-edged, blocky texture across a photograph.
//! - **Enlarging** (or 1:1) reconstruction dominates: the destination
//!   samples the Catmull-Rom cubic through the source samples. Holding each
//!   source sample across the destination pixels it lands on — a
//!   sample-and-hold — reproduces the source grid as visible blocks, which
//!   is precisely the artefact a wallpaper drawn larger than its decoded
//!   source must not show. The cubic is interpolating, so at 1:1 its
//!   weights collapse to a single unit tap and the resample is an exact
//!   copy; there is no needless blur on the ratio callers hit most.
//!
//! Both arms produce the same shape of answer — a small run of source
//! samples and a weight each — so there is one plan, one accumulation, and
//! one write-out for every resample this crate performs.
//!
//! # Arithmetic
//!
//! Integer throughout: weights are fixed-point fractions, normalised so each
//! destination sample's weights sum to exactly one. That exactness is what
//! keeps a flat region flat — a rounding residual spread across a large image
//! would show as banding — and it means two calls that should agree cannot
//! drift apart the way floating point would.
//!
//! Colour is filtered **premultiplied**, because that is the only correct way
//! to filter an image with an alpha channel: a fully transparent source pixel
//! contributes its transparency but not its (meaningless) colour, so scaling
//! artwork with transparent padding cannot drag that padding's colour into the
//! visible edge. A destination pixel whose whole footprint is transparent has
//! no colour to report and yields transparent black.
//!
//! # Alpha spaces
//!
//! Both spaces a desktop actually holds pixels in are resampled by the one
//! filter above, and each is read and written in its own space:
//!
//! - **Straight-alpha RGBA8** ([`resample`], [`resample_window`]) is the
//!   interchange form a decoder produces. Its samples are premultiplied on
//!   the way in and divided back out on the way out.
//! - **Premultiplied [`Pixel`]s** ([`crate::Surface::resampled`]) are what
//!   every [`crate::Surface`] already carries, so that path multiplies and
//!   divides nothing: it filters the stored channels as they are. Scaling a
//!   window's frame to a picker thumbnail therefore costs one allocation and
//!   one filter pass, where routing it through the straight-alpha entry point
//!   would copy and convert the whole frame twice over.
//!
//! # Streaming a reduction
//!
//! [`RowReducer`] is the reducing arm fed its source a row at a time, so a
//! decoder reduces a picture it never holds; the sums of a source row reach
//! at most two destination rows, which is what bounds it.
//!
//! # Windows
//!
//! [`resample_window`] produces an arbitrary *rectangle* of the
//! destination, so a caller that cannot hold — or cannot transport, or does
//! not want — the whole destination produces the part it needs. Each window
//! is computed from the source and the plan alone, never from a previous
//! one, so assembling windows yields byte-for-byte the image one call would
//! have produced and two windows agree exactly where they meet.
//! [`resample`] is the whole-image case expressed through that same one
//! implementation.
//!
//! Both axes are windowed, which is what makes a *zoom* affordable: showing
//! one screen-sized rectangle of a picture scaled to a hundred times its own
//! size costs that rectangle, and the scaled picture is never allocated. It
//! is also what makes panning exact — the destination is addressed in its
//! own pixels, so moving by one costs one, where a caller forced to name an
//! integer source rectangle could only move by the zoom factor.
//!
//! Scratch memory is a few window-width rows regardless of how extreme the
//! ratio is, so reducing a 4K photograph to a thumbnail costs no more
//! working memory than reducing it to a screen.
//!
//! Every entry point is total: degenerate geometry, a source region that
//! does not lie inside its image, a mis-sized output buffer, a window that
//! runs past the destination, and a buffer the allocator refuses all return
//! a typed refusal rather than panicking or writing a partial result.
