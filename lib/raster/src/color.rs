//! Colours and premultiplied-alpha compositing arithmetic.

//! [`blend_span`] is where a whole run of pixels is composited; the operators
//! below are the same arithmetic for one.
//!
//! The desktop rasteriser works exclusively in **premultiplied alpha**:
//! each colour channel of a [`Pixel`] is already scaled by its own alpha.
//! Premultiplication is what makes the Porter–Duff *over* operator a
//! single multiply-add per channel and keeps filtering and per-region
//! opacity correct.
//!
//! The operators are `#[inline]` because a per-pixel call is not a per-pixel
//! operator: the desktop's crates are built with many codegen units and no
//! link-time optimisation in the profile the debug image and the bench
//! harness use, so without it each of these becomes an out-of-line call per
//! pixel and nothing around it can vectorise.
