//! The shared separable box blur.
//!
//! One definition serves every frosted surface: the compositor's backdrop
//! blur (a window's rectangle frosted before its own translucent pixels
//! blend over it) and a control's own soft highlight. A horizontal pass then
//! a vertical one, each carrying a running sum, so the cost is the region's
//! area rather than its area times the radius.
//!
//! Every channel — alpha included — is averaged. Averaging premultiplied
//! channels is the correct operation on premultiplied data: the result is
//! the same convex combination of the contributing colours that compositing
//! them would give, so the `colour <= alpha` invariant survives and no halo
//! appears around a translucent edge.
//!
//! Edges replicate: a sample past the region's edge takes the edge pixel.
//! Every output therefore averages exactly `2 * radius + 1` samples, which
//! keeps the divisor constant across the pass and leaves a uniform field
//! exactly unchanged.
