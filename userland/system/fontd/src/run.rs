//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the font service, installed at
//! `/System/Services/fontd.app/Run` — the long-running user-space service
//! `login` launches on a display-capable machine to serve glyph coverage
//! (`plans/FONT-SERVICE.md` FS-3, FS-6).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI. `tairix-rt` provides
//! `_start`, the per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the
//! `#[global_allocator]`, the filesystem read wrappers used to discover
//! `/System/Fonts`, and the endpoint syscall wrappers (`call_create`/
//! `call_recv`/`call_reply`); `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! # What this service does
//!
//! At startup `fontd` lists `/System/Fonts` (a one-shot open authorised by the
//! manifest's `CAP_FS_ACCESS`; `/System` is mounted read-only so it holds no
//! write reach) and, for every subdirectory that carries a readable
//! `FontFamily` manifest, opens its declared face files — without reading
//! their bytes yet — and keeps the open handles for the service's life. A
//! face's bytes are read, once, the first time a request actually needs that
//! face: a session that never draws a script never pays for the face that
//! covers it. Discovery then binds the well-known
//! [`FONT_ENDPOINT`](tairix_abi::font_ipc::FONT_ENDPOINT) (a reserved
//! rendezvous, so binding it needs the manifest's `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`: a
//! squatter could otherwise feed forged coverage to the compositor and every
//! app), and blocks in a serve loop — receive a request, rasterise/serve the
//! reply, reply. The endpoint is unrestricted-sender: drawing text is not a
//! security boundary, so any process may ask, and the reply path validates
//! every field and fails closed.
//!
//! If the store cannot be listed, no family in it is usable, or the endpoint
//! cannot be bound, the service records `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` and exits
//! fail-closed; PID 1 supervises and relaunches. It never serves forged or
//! absent coverage.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
