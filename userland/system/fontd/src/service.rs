//! The font-service dispatcher: the host-testable core that turns one
//! decoded [`FontRequest`] into a framed `font-v1` reply.
//!
//! [`FontService`] owns the discovered families (built by
//! [`crate::discovery::discover`]), each holding its faces behind a face
//! cache that reads and parses a face's bytes on first use and
//! retains the parsed instances for the service's life. [`FontService::handle`]
//! is the whole request pipeline: decode, resolve, rasterise (or serve from
//! cache), and emit a reply — always producing bytes, an error frame on any
//! failure, so a caller never blocks on a dropped reply (fail closed).
//!
//! # Resolution
//!
//! A scalar resolves within the requested family's own faces, in manifest
//! order; if none maps it, within the family's declared fallback family's
//! faces, in the same order; if still nothing maps it, U+FFFD is rendered
//! from the requested family's primary face. Every glyph in one family's run
//! shares the geometry (pixels-per-em, baseline, box height) the requested
//! family's primary face defines at the requested pixel height, even when
//! the glyph itself came from a fallback face — so mixing scripts never
//! shifts the baseline or the line box mid-run.
//!
//! # Weights
//!
//! A face that declares a `wght` axis is instanced at the exact requested
//! weight, whose advance genuinely differs from another weight's; the
//! instanced [`Face`] is parsed once per distinct weight actually requested
//! and cached. A face with no such axis keeps its one default instance and
//! is thickened afterwards by the synthetic `embolden` transform, which
//! leaves its advance untouched.
//!
//! # The cache a hostile caller cannot grow
//!
//! The pixel height is caller-supplied, so the size of what a request makes
//! this service retain is caller-influenced. The cache is therefore bounded
//! in **bytes**, by a budget derived from the machine's own RAM, through the
//! shared reclaimable-memory model — the same [`tairix_reclaim::ReclaimCache`]
//! the render-path client on the other side of this endpoint uses, declared
//! once in [`tairix_font::glyph_cache`]. The key names the requesting family,
//! the family whose face actually supplied the glyph, that face's index,
//! the glyph id, the pixel height, and the weight, so two families can never
//! collide on the same slot even when they share a fallback face.
