//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the time service, installed at
//! `/System/Services/timed.app/Run` (`plans/TIMESYNC.md` TS-2).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI. `tairix-rt` provides
//! `_start`, the per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the
//! `#[global_allocator]`, the wall-clock and monotonic syscall wrappers, the
//! datagram socket and wait-set reactor, and the file reads and writes the
//! persisted record goes through; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's
//! `main`.
//!
//! # The reactor
//!
//! One wait-set over the delivery port the network stack posts this service's
//! datagrams to, armed with the timeout the engine's single folded deadline
//! implies. The loop parks; it never polls. A wake is either a datagram
//! (evaluate it in the sandbox worker, apply the verdict) or the deadline
//! lapsing (send the next request). With no deadline left — every server in
//! use retired and the re-selection ladder spent — the service exits rather
//! than holding a task and a bound delivery port doing nothing.
//!
//! # Where the servers come from
//!
//! The three tiers of `tairix_timesync::select_servers`: the operator's
//! `time.servers`, else what DHCP offered, else the built-in fallback. A
//! boot-floor service starts before either of the first two is knowable, so it
//! starts on the fallback and re-selects on a bounded ladder, replacing its
//! servers only when a *strictly better* tier appears.
//!
//! # Two roles, one binary
//!
//! Started with the sandbox worker argument, this binary *is* the
//! capability-less NTP evaluation worker (`tairix_sandbox::rt`); started
//! normally it is the service. That is the seam's canonical shape: the parent
//! spawns its own binary through the kernel's sandbox spawn mode, so the
//! worker holds two pipe ends and nothing else.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
