//! TAIRiX userland driver host (Stage 4).
//!
//! This crate is the userland service that owns the lifecycle of every
//! `.rxe` driver module on a running TAIRiX system. It is the single point
//! at which a driver image is parsed, verified, capability-checked, and
//! handed an environment ([`tairix_abi::DriverHost`]) to register itself
//! against. Per the host runs in user space by default;
//! the same code path also handles `kind = "in-kernel"` drivers by
//! demanding [`CapabilityId::DRV_KERNEL`](tairix_abi::CapabilityId::DRV_KERNEL)
//! on top of the universal
//! [`CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD`](tairix_abi::CapabilityId::DRV_LOAD).
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! For every `load`/`reload` the host executes the following checks in
//! order, **failing closed** at the first failure:
//!
//! 1. Decode the [`tairix_abi::DriverManifest`] header.
//! 2. Reject if `abi_version` is not the host's accepted version.
//! 3. Reject if `syscall_table_hash` does not match the host's compiled-in
//!    hash (i.e. an `abi-vN` binary on an `abi-vM` host).
//! 4. Reject if the signer key is not on the host's trust anchor list.
//! 5. Verify the Ed25519 signature with [`tairix_crypto`].
//! 6. Decode the capability body and reject if `kind = InKernel` without
//!    `CAP_DRV_KERNEL` in the caller's set.
//! 7. Reject if the manifest's requested capability set is **not a subset**
//!    of the caller's set (capabilities can be
//!    delegated but never widened).
//! 8. Hand the verified manifest + payload to the host's
//!    [`DriverSpawner`], which completes the driver's registration in its
//!    own protection domain and reports the outcome.
//! 9. Issue a fresh [`DriverHandle`] and emit a structured log record via
//!    [`tairix_log`].
//!
//! Buffers that held the manifest signature or capability bitmap are
//! cleared with [`zeroize::secure_clear`] when the load record is dropped
//! ("Zero-on-free for any allocation that ever held
//! credentials, keys, or capability tokens").
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! * [`error`] — host-level error type returned across the public API.
//! * [`events`] — stable [`tairix_log::EventId`] constants (`7000` range).
//! * [`image`] — `.rxe` envelope splitter (header + capability body +
//!   payload).
//! * [`zeroize`] — volatile-clear primitive used to wipe sensitive
//!   buffers.
//! * [`source`] — [`ImageSource`] trait abstracting file IO so the host
//!   stays `no_std`.
//! * [`store`] — the signed driver-store scan that turns the installed
//!   `/System/Drivers/` bundles into `devmgr` autoload candidates.
//! * [`spawner`] — [`DriverSpawner`] trait that completes a verified
//!   image's registration in its own protection domain.
//! * [`host`] — the [`Host`] state machine implementing `load` / `unload`
//!   / `reload`.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` and pulls only the audited
//! `tairix-abi`, `tairix-caps`, `tairix-crypto`, `tairix-devmatch` and
//! `tairix-log` crates — all under `lib/*`, so the host never links a
//! kernel or driver crate.
//! It exposes no `unsafe` across its crate boundary — the one in-tree
//! `unsafe` block lives in [`zeroize::secure_clear`] and is covered by a
//! unit test.
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! Tier: `experimental` (). The public surface will
//! freeze when Stage 4 lands its first real driver. The wire formats
//! consumed (manifest header, capability body) are already frozen by
//! `tairix-abi`.
