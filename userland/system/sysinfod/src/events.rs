//! Stable [`tairix_log::EventId`] constants emitted by `sysinfod`.
//!
//! Per `lib/log` convention every subsystem owns a
//! 1 000-wide reserved range. The System Information service occupies
//! `8000..9000` (adjacent to the driver host's `7000..8000`). Once shipped
//! the numeric values must never be re-used or re-numbered — external
//! audit-log consumers rely on them.
