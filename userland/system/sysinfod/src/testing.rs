//! Attested fixture principals shared by this crate's host tests.
//!
//! Every test caller is minted here rather than assembled test by test, for
//! one security-relevant reason: the reporter registry keys and refuses
//! reporters by the kernel-attested process-instance id, and the all-zero
//! [`ProcId::KERNEL`] is reserved for a kernel principal that may never
//! self-report. A fixture that spells that id by accident — filling all
//! sixteen bytes with a discriminating value that happens to be zero — is
//! refused exactly as a hostile kernel-domain caller would be, and the test
//! then fails for a reason unrelated to what it was checking. Minting every
//! identity through [`instance`], where the reserved value is unreachable,
//! puts that mistake out of reach instead of asking each test to remember
//! it.
