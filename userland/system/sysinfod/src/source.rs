//! The data-provider seam: everything `sysinfod` knows about live system
//! state is read through [`SysinfoSource`].
//!
//! The dispatcher in [`crate::service`] owns *policy* — request decoding,
//! capability enforcement, paging bounds, and audit
//! logging — and nothing else. The *data* is supplied by an implementation
//! of [`SysinfoSource`] injected by `init` when it starts the service: on a
//! running kernel this is a thin shim over the kernel's process table and
