//! The device manager's reactive match-and-load loop.
//!
//! The `Run` service fetches the kernel-decoded driver catalogue once (the
//! read-only `/System` store is static for the life of the system), then reads the discovered hardware tree, loads a
//! driver for every node that matches a catalogue bundle, and **blocks**
//! until the tree changes and re-reads it — the reactive discovery the
//! hotplug model requires. Both halves are pure with respect to the kernel:
//! the loop reads/waits through the [`HwTreeService`] seam and fetches/loads
//! through the [`DriverStoreCall`] seam, so its logic — fetch once, then
//! unload and match-and-load whenever a generation advance changes the node
//! set — is exercised on the host against scripted doubles, independently
//! of the freestanding
//! `hw_tree_read` / `hw_tree_wait` / `ipc_call` syscalls it binds in
//! production.
//!
//! The loop never busy-spins: [`HwTreeService::wait_for_change`] parks until
//! the store's generation advances, indefinitely once nothing is
//! outstanding. The exceptions are the milestones with no generation bump
//! behind them — an unfetched catalogue, and a device channel a service was
//! not yet up to accept — which wait under a bounded retry deadline
//! (`DEFERRED_RETRY_NS`). A failure in a tree-seam
//! operation ends the loop fail-closed with the reported [`Errno`]; a catalogue that cannot be fetched is fail-soft —
//! the service loads nothing but keeps observing.
