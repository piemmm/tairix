//! Delivering the stack-wide `net.*` policy to the network stack.
//!
//! `netstack` is the network-parsing sandbox and holds no filesystem
//! capability, so it cannot read `/System/Settings/Configuration/system.conf`
//! itself. The device manager already holds `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and drives the
//! network stack's admin endpoint (see [`crate::netbind`]), so it is the
//! component that reads the stack-wide `net.*` settings from the
//! configuration store post-unlock and delivers them to `netstack` over the
//! capability-gated `ApplyNetworkSettings` admin op (`plans/NETWORK.md`
//! N9b-2).
//!
//! This module is the pure, host-testable policy for that delivery: read the
//! settings through the [`NetworkConfigSource`] seam and, until they have
//! been delivered, push them through the [`crate::netbind::NetstackBind`]
//! seam. Delivery is fail-soft — the store may not be mounted yet (before the
//! root unlock) and the stack may not be up yet, so a failed attempt is
//! logged and retried when the hardware tree next moves or a volume is
//! mounted, exactly like an unavailable driver store. Until the real policy lands, `netstack`'s own
//! safe defaults (both families enabled, SYN cookies `auto`) hold.
