//! Service descriptions and the seams init uses to reach the outside world.
//!
//! A [`ServiceSpec`] is the static description of one system service: its
//! name, the binary that runs it, the service account it runs as, and the
//! services it must start after. The [`Spawner`] and [`Reaper`] traits are
//! the two seams through which the otherwise-pure [`Init`](crate::Init)
//! manager launches a verified binary and learns that a child has exited. On
//! a running kernel they are backed by syscalls; in tests they are in-memory
//! fixtures.
//!
//! The **kernel is the single authority over a service's capabilities**: it
//! reads the service binary's signed bundle manifest at load time and grants
//! the intersection of the manifest's request with the service account's
//! ceiling. The manager names only *what* to run and *as whom* (the
//! [`ServiceSpec::account`] uid); it never decodes a manifest or computes a
//! grant on the launch path, so there is no second capability-derivation
//! path to drift from the kernel's authoritative one.
