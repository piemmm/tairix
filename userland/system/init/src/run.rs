//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `init` application bundle
//! (`plans/PI.md` P6b).
//!
//! This is the program the kernel spawns as PID 1 once it reaches user mode
//! (`plans/PI.md` P6c). It is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so `init` links the Rust userland runtime
//! `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI (`crt0` + `abi-sys`), which exists solely
//! for programs **not** written in Rust. `tairix-rt`
//! provides `_start`, the per-process stack canary, the
//! panic handler, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` parses the compiled-in `startup::DEFAULT_CONFIG`, renders the
//! startup banner from the kernel-attested `boot_facts_get` machine
//! summary (version, installed memory, architecture, core count), writes
//! it to its inherited standard output (fd 1) through the shared
//! `tairix_rt::io` layer over the `abi-v1` `stream_write` syscall
//! (`init` binds to the stream, never a device), then **supervises** the
//! user's sessions: one session program per installed text console
//! (`console_count`, each spawned onto its console by `spawn_in` with the
//! `service_attach` block — the video console when a display is active, else
//! the discovered UART, `plans/PI.md` P11), reaped with wait-any and relaunched
//! on their own consoles ([`supervisor`]). The runtime routes `main`'s return
//! value through the `exit` syscall.
//!
//! It drives the sibling `tairix-init` engine over the kernel through the
//! runtime, with its compiled-in startup description parsed beside it in
//! [`startup`] and host-tested there. The binary is built position-independent
//! and converted to an `rxe` blob by the consuming boot path (`plans/PI.md`
//! P6c). On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy,
//! and fmt still cover the crate.

//
// On the host (`cargo build --workspace`, clippy, fmt) the program's real
// entry — the freestanding `tairix-rt` `_start` path — is not compiled, so
// this inert `main` keeps the crate building under the host tooling. It
// parses the compiled-in default config (touching the parser's accessors and
// the `service_name` derivation each boot-floor entry now flows through) so a
// malformed `DEFAULT_CONFIG` is caught by an ordinary `cargo build`, and
// drives the session supervisor against scripted seams that replay one of
// every event, so no reactor arm is dead code on the host. It performs no
// I/O. The real engine-backed [`Services`](supervisor::Services) glue is
// exercised by the freestanding build and the QEMU boot vertical; the pure
// supervision policy and the engine itself are host-tested in their own
// modules.
