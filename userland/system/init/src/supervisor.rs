//! PID 1's session supervision: one login session per installed text
//! console (`plans/PI.md` P11).
//!
//! The kernel installs one stream backing per text console it discovers —
//! the video console when a display is active (the UART then carries only
//! the debug log, with no session), else the discovered UART — and reports
//! how many exist through the `console_count` syscall. PID 1 launches the
//! configured session program once per console with `spawn`'s explicit
//! console selector and supervises the whole set from **one** park:
//! whichever session exits is reaped and relaunched on **its own** console,
//! within a per-console crash-loop budget (never an unbounded `spawn` loop).
//!
//! That park is multiplexed rather than a wait on children alone, because
//! PID 1 is also the service manager's control surface and the owner of its
//! one-shot timers. A wait on children would leave a control request
//! unanswered until some unrelated process happened to exit; a second loop
//! or a poll between the two would be the cooperative dispatch the charter
//! forbids. So there is one loop, and [`Sessions::wait_next`] reports which
//! of the three woke it.
//!
//! The long-running **services** (the System Information, network-stack,
//! device-manager, and seat-manager services, today) are **not** supervised
//! here: they are the [`Init`](tairix_init::Init) service-manager engine's job
//! (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` SVC-A). PID 1 registers them with the
//! engine, brings them up in dependency order, and drives the engine's
//! readiness-gated admission and restart-policy state machine — the model
//! that lets discovery/registration and on-demand activation follow. This
//! module owns only the per-console **session** half, layered over that
//! engine through the [`Services`] seam: the one wait-any loop routes each
//! reaped pid to a session relaunch or to the engine (which reaps a known
//! service — applying its restart policy — or an untracked child).
//!
//! The logic is pure and parameterised over the [`Sessions`] and [`Services`]
//! seams so every decision — session fan-out, pid→console accounting,
//! per-console budgets, exhaustion, error propagation, and service routing —
//! is host-tested without a kernel, mirroring the `startup` config parser's
//! split. The freestanding `run` binary backs [`Sessions`] with the real
//! `tairix-rt` syscall wrappers and [`Services`] with the live
//! [`Init`](tairix_init::Init) engine; the per-console session table is a fixed
//! stack array, so the session half itself allocates nothing.

/// Most consoles PID 1 supervises in the bootstrap (allocation-free)
/// supervisor.
///
/// A stack-array sizing for the no-heap PID 1, not a system policy: the
/// kernel's console list is discovered hardware (today a single display
