//! The authority scope a service-manager instance wields
//! (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md` §3.2).
//!
//! TAIRiX runs **one policy engine at two authority scopes**, never two
//! codebases: the single system service manager (PID 1's role) and one per-user
//! manager instance per logged-in user. The scope an [`Init`] was created with
//! is the security boundary between those two roles — it is fixed for the
//! instance's whole life and decides which services that instance is allowed to
//! manage.
//!
//! # The boundary this enforces
//!
//! A per-user manager is spawned by the system manager at session start and
//! delegated only that user's authority. It must never be able to bring a
//! system-authority service to life, nor reach another user's services: a
//! user's on-demand request can never make a system-authority service appear,
//! and one user's manager can never touch another user's services.
//!
//! Because a service is always launched **as a service account** (a uid) and
//! the kernel derives the capability grant from that account's ceiling — the
//! kernel is the single capability authority — a manager confined to one user
//! can only be permitted to manage services that run **as that user**. Naming
//! any other account (a system service account, or another user's uid) is the
//! escalation this scope refuses, fail closed.
//!
//! This is deliberately an *identity* boundary, not a capability computation.
//! The engine never decodes a manifest or derives a grant on the launch path;
//! it checks only the one fact it already holds — the service account the
//! [`ServiceSpec`] names — so there is no second capability-derivation path to
//! drift from the kernel's authoritative one.
//!
