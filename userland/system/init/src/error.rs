//! Error and failure types surfaced by the [`Init`](crate::Init) manager.
//!
//! Two distinct vocabularies are deliberately kept apart:
//!
//! * [`InitError`] is a **graph-level, fail-closed** error returned by
//!   [`Init::register`](crate::Init::register) and
//!   [`Init::start_all`](crate::Init::start_all). It signals a structural
//!   defect in the registered service set — a duplicate name, a dependency
//!   on an unregistered service, or a cycle — that prevents *any* service
//!   from coming up. The system does not boot a
//!   partial, surprising configuration.
//! * [`StartFailure`] is a **per-service** outcome recorded in the
//!   [`StartReport`](crate::StartReport). When the graph is sound, init
//!   brings up every service it can; a single service that fails (and the
//!   dependents it blocks) is reported here without aborting the services
//!   that are independent of it.
