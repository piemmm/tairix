//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the journal service, installed at
//! `/System/Services/journald` — the long-running user-space service PID 1
//! `init` launches to own authoritative system-log segment writes (SYSLOG
//! §12/§15).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `#[global_allocator]`, and
//! the syscall wrappers (`call_create`/`call_recv`/`call_reply`/
//! `call_peer_origin`/`self_origin`/`boot_id`/`clock_get`/`wall_time`/the
//! `fs_*` file API); `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! # What this service does
//!
//! At startup it reads its installation identity — the per-installation
//! machine-id (`/System/Security/MachineId`, non-secret) and, when present,
//! the log-attestation key (`/System/Security/Keys/LogAttestation`, the secret
//! that seals `audit`/`security` segments) — reads its own attested `Origin`
//! (`self_origin`) and the per-boot `BootId`, and builds a `Journal` over an
//! FS-backed `SegmentStore` that writes each closed segment as its own
//! immutable file under `/System/Logs/<stream>/`. It then binds the well-known
//! `LOG_INGRESS_ENDPOINT` (an unrestricted-sender call endpoint — any process
//! may post a log record, but the id is a reserved rendezvous, so binding it
//! needs `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`: a squatter could otherwise capture every
//! process's log traffic) and blocks in a serve loop: receive a framed
//! request, read the caller's kernel-attested `Origin` (`call_peer_origin`,
//! never a caller claim), stamp the record with the journal's own ingest lane
//! and the current monotonic + wall time, and hand it to the `serve` dispatch
//! core (`tairix_journald::serve`), which admits it under the attested origin
//! and commits it. It installs a per-stream rate limit so a log flood on the
//! caller-writable `runtime`/`debug` streams is bounded (the system-authority
//! streams are never dropped); dropped records surface as coalesced trusted
//! loss records on the `journal` stream.
//!
//! Every authoritative fact — origin, source, stream, sequence, time — is the
//! kernel's or the journal's, never the caller's; the caller supplies only its
//! message and advisory hints. Missing installation identity fails closed
//! (`audit`/`security` cannot be sealed without the key, and the service
//! refuses to start without a machine-id or boot-id rather than binding logs
//! to a fabricated genesis).
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
