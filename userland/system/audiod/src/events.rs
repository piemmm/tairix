//! Stable audit event ids the audio service records its security decisions
//! under (`plans/SOUND.md`, `plans/SYSLOG.md`).
//!
//! A refusal is as audit-worthy as a grant — "who tried" is the question an
//! incident asks — so the capture path records both. The recording indicator
//! the session draws is rendered from the same live state these records
//! describe, so what a user sees and what the log holds cannot disagree.
