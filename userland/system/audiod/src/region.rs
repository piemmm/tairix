//! The shared-PCM-region seam (`plans/SOUND.md`).
//!
//! The service holds a mapping of every ring it moves frames through, and
//! those rings arrive from two opposite directions: a *client* mints its own
//! and grants it inward, while the service mints a *device* ring and grants
//! it outward to the driver. [`RegionHost`] spells both, so neither can be
//! mistaken for the other, and abstracts the `shm_*` syscalls so the whole
//! engine is exercised on the host against an in-process double.
