//! The bound devices, their configured endpoints, the live streams, and the
//! period pump that moves frames between them (`plans/SOUND.md`).
//!
//! # What a period costs
//!
//! Everything a period touches is allocated when a stream opens or an
//! endpoint is configured, and reused: the client-format scratch a stream's
//! frames are read into, its pivot and resampled buffers, the endpoint's one
//! device period, and the mixer's own working set. The pump borrows one
//! shared region at a time — each client ring in turn, then the device ring —
//! which is the discipline [`RegionHost::bytes`] states in its signature, and
//! it folds the live streams into the mixer as an iterator so there is no
//! per-period collection to build either.
//!
//! # Silence is accounted, never hidden
//!
//! A running stream with nothing queued contributes silence for exactly the
//! frames it missed and takes the underrun; the device would otherwise run
//! dry, which is strictly worse and is what its driver would report instead.
//! A *draining* stream is different: the pump emits only the frames it
//! genuinely has, so a drain's tail is a short chunk rather than a padded
//! one, and the drain is then passed down to the device.
