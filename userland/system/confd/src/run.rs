//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the app-data service, installed at
//! `/System/Services/confd.app/Run` — the long-running user-space service PID 1
//! `init` launches so every application has a private, isolated settings store
//! (`plans/APPDATA.md` AD4).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt`, never the C ABI. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`,
//! the per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `#[global_allocator]`,
//! the `fs_*` file API the store reads and writes through, the `random_get`
//! draw the sealed scope's key material and nonces come from, and the endpoint
//! syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! It binds the reserved [`APPDATA_ENDPOINT`](tairix_abi::appdata_ipc::APPDATA_ENDPOINT)
//! — a rendezvous whose bind needs the manifest's `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`,
//! because a squatter that claimed it first could serve forged settings to
//! every application on the machine — and then blocks in a serve loop: receive
//! a request, read the caller's kernel-attested origin, answer, reply. It comes
//! up before any volume is unlocked and answers `DeviceOffline` until storage is
//! reachable, so an early caller gets a typed refusal rather than a guess. If
//! the endpoint cannot be bound it records `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` and exits
//! fail-closed; PID 1 supervises and relaunches it.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
