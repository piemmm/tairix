//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `sysinfo` tool — the terminal client a
//! shell spawns to query the System Information API.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global
//! allocator, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` collects the inherited argument vector, parses it with the pure
//! [`tairix_sysinfo`] grammar, and runs the resulting command against the two
//! production seams shared through `lib/procinfo`: `IpcTransport`, which
//! carries the framed `sysinfo-v1` request to `/System/Services/sysinfod.app/Run` over
//! the well-known IPC call endpoint, and `RtOutput`, which writes each
//! rendered line to the inherited standard output (fd 1). The tool binds only
//! to its inherited descriptors, never a console device, and holds no ambient
//! authority: `sysinfod` gates every query against the caller's kernel-attested
//! origin.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
