## NAME

sysinfo — query system information

## SYNOPSIS

`sysinfo <query>`

## DESCRIPTION

Issues one typed query to the System Information API and renders the
reply. TAIRiX has no `/proc` and no `/sys`: this command is the
terminal face of the same versioned, capability-checked API every
program uses, and no path bypasses the capability check.

The queries:

- `processes`, `ps` — list processes, one row per process.
- `memory`, `mem` — kernel memory statistics (needs
  `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`).
- `hardware`, `hw` — the detected hardware tree (needs
  `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`).
- `identity`, `id` — machine identity and OS version.
- `uptime` — time since boot and the boot wall-clock time.
- `limits`, `rlimits` — your effective resource limits and live usage.
- `seats` — the seat inventory: each display's owner and foreground
  console (needs `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`).
- `pressure` — the live memory-pressure gauge: band, watermarks, and
  transition counters (needs `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`).
- `reclaim` — the reclaimable-cache ledger, one row per class (needs
  `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`).
- `ramzip` — the compressed memory tier's counters (needs
  `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`).
- `cpu` — per-CPU run-queue depth, context switches, and preemptions
  (needs `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`).
- `cpuinfo` — the per-CPU processor report (a `/proc/cpuinfo`-superset):
  each CPU's model/vendor, performance class, ISA-extension flags, raw
  identity register, the live measured core-clock speed (in MHz — or an
  honest "unknown" where no core-clock counter exists), and the fixed
  reference/timebase frequency. Public hardware facts, no capability
  required.
- `irq`, `irqs` — the kernel IRQ table: one row per bound interrupt
  line — its id, the owning driver task, the interrupt count since
  boot, and whether the line is quarantined (needs `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`).
- `frames` — what each desktop session's composited frames have cost:
  one row per publishing session — the pixels its frames recomposed and
  the mean per frame, the overdraw multiple (layer contributions per
  damaged pixel), the share resolved by copying an opaque run, the
  pixels a recomputed backdrop frost re-blurred, the pixels converted to
  scan-out, the worst single frame and its share of the screen, the
  driver calls that published them, and the window-furniture cache's
  hits and misses. These are the desktop's own figures — only a process
  holding a compositor can count pixels — so each row names the
  publisher the service attested it to, and a session that has published
  nothing prints no row (needs `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`).
- `storage`, `io` — three per-volume tables, one row per fault-aware
  block-backed volume in each, keyed by a prefix of the volume's durable
  id and naming the device serving it. That identity is the serving
  block-service endpoint where a user-space driver serves the device, and
  a reserved kernel-driven identity where the kernel drives it itself —
  the disk the machine booted from, which has no serving endpoint at all.
  **Service** additionally names the device: the short name its own
  driver declares (`virtio-blk`, `emmc2`, `usb-msd`), or `-` where it
  declares none. It carries the cumulative bytes, completed requests and
  device-busy time a reader deltas into throughput, IOPS, utilisation and
  await — nothing is pre-derived, so two readers never inherit one
  averaging window (no capability needed). **Queue** carries what is outstanding now, the
  accumulators a mean depth deltas out of, and the depth and deadline
  the device's own class permits. **Health** carries the volume's
  current availability (available/degraded/recovering/lost) and the
  cumulative outcome counters (completions, resets, timeouts, medium
  errors, reissues) a failing or flapping disk becomes visible on. The
  last two need `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`; the service table is printed
  first, so a caller without it still reads the utilisation figures
  before the refusal is reported.
- `raid`, `arrays` — the composed RAID arrays and the devices the array
  composer holds: one row per array — a prefix of its identity, its
  level, its health (optimal/degraded/recovering/failed), its in-sync
  and defined member tallies, its stripe unit, its block count, and any
  rebuild or verification pass in progress — then one row per device —
  its hardware-tree node, the array it belongs to (a dash for an
  unaffiliated candidate), its slot, its disposition
  (candidate/held/in-sync/resyncing/faulted), its size, and the
  metadata generation it carries (needs `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`).
- `dma`, `iommu` — the DMA translation units: one row per unit — its
  hardware-tree node, its family, whether it translates or why not, how it
  raises its faults, where its translations live, the owners and firmware
  streams it holds, and its faults recorded and dropped, and the streams a
  storm silenced, since boot — then one row per isolation group an owner
  holds — its unit, the holder's node and generation, and where that owner
  stands — then one row per node a unit translates for an owner — its unit
  and group, its owner's generation and state, how many streams it masters
  through, and its domain's mappings and the bytes they map (needs
  `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`).
- `show <resource-ref>` — read one `info:`/`state:`/`stats:` resource
  reference and print its value. Those namespaces are typed values served
  through this API, never byte streams, so this is how one is read — `cat`
  cannot open it. A denial names the capability the resource needs.
- `describe <resource-ref>` — print the response envelope instead of the
  value: its producer, the authorization it was served under, and the
  payload's own metadata — for a metric its kind, unit, reset behaviour, and
  sampling window; for a fact its type and sensitivity.
- `help` — this command's own short help.

With no query, the short help is shown.

## OPTIONS

- `--all, -a` — with `processes`: list every process on the system
  rather than only your own; the service grants this view only to a
  caller holding `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`.
- `-h, -?` — show this command's own short help.

## EXAMPLES

- `sysinfo identity` — print the machine identity and OS version.
- `sysinfo ps --all` — list every process on the system.
- `sysinfo frames` — show what the desktop's frames are costing.

## EXIT STATUS

- `0` — the query was answered and rendered.
- `1` — the service refused or failed, or the result could not be
  delivered.
- `2` — the command line was not understood.

## ENVIRONMENT

- `LANG` — the preferred locale for the short help (a BCP-47 tag such
  as `fr-FR`).

## SEE ALSO

- `man`
- `ps`
- `top`
