## NAME

servicectl — start, stop, enable and disable system services

## SYNOPSIS

`servicectl [-h | -?] start|stop|enable|disable SERVICE`

## DESCRIPTION

Asks the service manager to change a registered service's runtime state,
over its capability-gated control endpoint. The manager decides: this tool
only encodes the request and reports the answer.

Reaching the endpoint is itself the authority. Without
`CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL` in your account's ceiling the kernel refuses the call
before the manager sees it, so an unprivileged account cannot even ask.

- `start SERVICE` — bring a registered, currently-down service up now. The
  readiness conditions it requires still apply: a service whose conditions
  are unmet is refused rather than started into a system that cannot
  support it.
- `stop SERVICE` — stop a running service gracefully, and its dependents
  in reverse-dependency order. The service is asked to exit and forced down
  only after its grace period.
- `enable SERVICE` — record the service as enrolled, so the manager brings
  it up at every boot, and start it now.
- `disable SERVICE` — record it as not enrolled, so no later boot starts it,
  and stop it now.

On success one line names the state the manager left the service in.

Either kind of change affects every principal on the machine, not just your
own session. `start` and `stop` change only the *running* system, so an
enrolled service comes back at the next boot; `enable` and `disable` change
what is enrolled, so they also survive one.

## OPTIONS

- `-h, -?` — show this command's own short help and exit.
- `--` — end the options, so a service whose name begins with a dash can
  still be named.

## EXIT STATUS

- `0` — the operation was applied, or the short help was shown.
- `1` — the manager refused the operation, recorded the enrolment but
  could not start or stop the service, or the control endpoint could not be
  reached.
- `2` — the command line was not understood; nothing was sent.

## ENVIRONMENT

- `LANG` — the preferred locale for the short help (a BCP-47 tag such as
  `fr-FR`).

## SEE ALSO

- `ps`
- `man`
