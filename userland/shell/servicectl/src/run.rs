//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `servicectl` tool — the control
//! client an administrator's shell spawns (`plans/NEW-SERVICEMANAGER.md`
//! SVC-8).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global
//! allocator, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` parses the inherited argument vector and binds the behaviour
//! library's two seams to production: the service-control endpoint through
//! `ipc_call`, and the inherited standard streams. The tool holds no ambient
//! authority — reaching the endpoint *is* the authority, and the kernel
//! refuses the call outright for an account whose ceiling does not carry
//! `CAP_SERVICE_CONTROL`.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
