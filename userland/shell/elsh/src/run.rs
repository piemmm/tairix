//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `Shell` application bundle — the program PID 1 `init` launches as the user's
//! session through the `spawn` syscall (`plans/SPAWN.md` `SP3b`,
//! `plans/PI.md` P6e).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so
//! it links the Rust userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which
//! exists solely for programs **not** written in Rust.
//! `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global allocator, and the
//! syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` runs the [`tairix_elsh`] interpreter as a read-eval-print loop over
//! its **inherited standard streams**: it reads command
//! lines from standard input (fd 0), writes the prompt and command output to
//! standard output and standard error (fd 1 / fd 2), and emits advisory
//! metadata on the standard information stream (fd 3). It binds to those
//! descriptors only — never a console, UART, or framebuffer — because binding
//! to a device would be ambient authority and hidden coupling; the same binary therefore works whatever the spawner
//! backed the streams with.
//!
//! The interpreter is pure: it decides *what* to run but reaches the outside
//! world only through injected seams. `RtConsole` carries its output to
//! fd 1 / fd 2, `RtProcessHost` launches external commands through the
//! `spawn` syscall and reaps them through `wait`, `RtDirLister` reads
//! directories for filename completion, and `RtResourceLister` reads the live
//! names behind a resource-selector placeholder from the System Information
//! API. A command word is resolved
//! to a runnable bundle through the shared candidate policy
//! ([`tairix_cmdres::resolution_candidates`]): the two system stores, the
//! user's own two stores, then their `PATH`, attempted in order. The
//! command's words travel to the child as its argument vector and the
//! shell's exported variables (with any `NAME=v cmd` prefix overrides) as
//! its environment, through the `spawn` startup-strings block. Pipes and
//! redirections run end to end (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP10): the pure
//! `tairix_elsh::wireplan` planner lowers each pipeline into pre-opened
//! targets, per-member spawn attach blocks, and the here-string / multios
//! byte pumps this host executes over
//! `fs_open`/`resource_open`/`pipe_create`/`spawn_attached`. A read of a
//! value-backed reference (`cat < info:mem/physical`) is the one target the
//! kernel cannot open, so this host reads it over the System Information API
//! under its own attested identity and hands the child the filled pipe.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
