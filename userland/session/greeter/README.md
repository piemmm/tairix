# tairix-greeter-service — the graphical login screen

`greeter.app`: the screen TAIRiX puts up to ask who is at the machine. It ships
as a `kind = "service"` bundle planted at `/System/Services/greeter.app/Run`
and is spawned by the `login` authority as the dedicated `greeter` service
account (uid 16).

**Stability tier: experimental.**

## What it is

**The greeter draws and types; the authority decides.**

It owns the seat, paints the shared authentication surface (`lib/greeter`), and
relays what was typed to the session authority over `session-v1`. It holds no
credential store, cannot read the user database, cannot start a process, and
binds no privileged endpoint. Everything it knows about the machine's accounts
is what the authority chose to publish — a display name, a login name, and
whether that account already has a live session. Everything it learns about a
secret is one of three answers, and only a verified one finishes the screen.

Compromising it therefore yields a screen, not an account.

The one shared surface it paints is `lib/greeter`'s, the same one the desktop's
screen lock uses; there is no second login surface here. The one pixel path it
scans out through is `lib/display`'s (`ChannelOrder`, `scanout_len`,
`sub_screen_damage`); only the loop that walks one painted surface into one
frame at the mode's stride is this crate's own, because a compositor blending
many windows is genuinely different work. The pointer it draws is
`lib/cursor`'s artwork placed by `lib/cursor`'s `PlacedCursor` — the same type
the compositor uses, which is why the placement lives in `lib/*`: a
`userland/session/*` crate may not depend on `userland/gui/*`.

## Capabilities

The manifest (`AppInfo.toml`) requests exactly five, and the granted set is
that request intersected with the `greeter` service account's ceiling
(`lib/users`, `grants::GREETER_CEILING`) — deliberately the same five:

| Capability | Why |
|---|---|
| `CAP_DISPLAY` | hold the seat's exclusive revocable lease, configure the display service, and switch the display off while the screen sleeps |
| `CAP_INPUT_READ` | drain the owned seat's keyboard and pointer channels |
| `CAP_SHM` | create the double-buffered frame region and grant it to the display service |
| `CAP_CONSOLE_WRITE` | state an abnormal exit's reason on `stderr` |
| `CAP_LOG_EMIT` | its own audit records |

It stops there on purpose. No `CAP_USERS_READ`: it never sees a credential
store. No `CAP_FS_ACCESS`: the ribbon behind the column is drawn, not loaded,
so it reads no file. No `CAP_PROC_SPAWN`, `CAP_SPAWN_AS_USER` or
`CAP_SANDBOX_SPAWN`: it decodes no untrusted image and starts no process of
any kind, so it cannot start the session it is authenticating for or choose
*which* program runs as the authenticated user — the authority starts that on
its own loop once the greeter exits `0`. No `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`: it
serves nothing and is only ever a *client* of `SESSION_ENDPOINT` and
`DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`.

## Degradation

A login screen that refuses to appear locks a user out of their own machine, so
every absence short of "there is no screen" is presented rather than fatal:

| Absent | What happens |
|---|---|
| No account list | the chooser stands with its typed-name tile alone |
| The authority unreachable | the surface says so and keeps asking — it does **not** exit, so a transient fault cannot spend the authority's restart budget |
| No memory for the ribbon | the flat desktop colour |
| A display that cannot or will not switch itself off | kept black while the screen sleeps |
| A display that will not switch back on | the screen stays asleep; the next input asks again |
| A pointer that will not rasterise | no cursor is drawn; the pointer still moves and hit-tests, and the keyboard alone logs in |
| No trusted clock | the clock's corner is empty. Never invented |
| No machine identity, or no host name | the identity names only what is known — `TAIRiX 0.0.0`, or `TAIRiX` alone |
| A zero-extent or unqueryable display mode | **fatal**: the reason is stated on `stderr`, the exit is non-zero, and the authority falls back to a text login |
| The seat lease taken away | **fatal**: the seat reports a lost lease ready forever, so re-parking would spin a core. The reason is stated and the exit is non-zero |
| Anything at all going wrong *during the closing fade* | the exit is still `0`: the login already succeeded, and a cosmetic step may not strand it |

Every abnormal exit writes one concise reason to `stderr` before exiting; the
reason never names an account or anything about a secret.

## Leaving the screen

A verified secret exits `0`, and the authority — watching for exactly that —
starts the session itself. The desktop therefore cannot appear until this
process is gone, which is why the fade to black is finished *before* the exit:
the screen is already black when the desktop reveals from black over it, and
there is no seam between the two.

The loop that presents it is bounded and total. It starts the surface's veil,
then parks on the wait set for each frame the timeline asks for, presents, and
stops as soon as the veil has arrived. Every other way out ends it rather than
the login: it is capped by a frame budget derived from the theme's own
duration, so even a clock that stops leaves; a seat that stops delivering or a
wait that fails returns at once; and a refused present is ignored, exactly as
it is on any other frame. The caller exits `0` regardless.

The seat is still drained each round, though nothing acts on what it holds:
unread input reads ready forever, and the park would return immediately instead
of pacing the fade. Input is *dropped*, not applied — the decision is made, and
a keystroke must not re-open the prompt. The pointer goes with the screen for
the same reason: it is an affordance for a screen that has stopped answering,
so it is not drawn from the first veiled frame rather than left bright over the
black. A reduced-motion theme leaves immediately, with no extra present at all.

## How it parks

There is one wait set holding the seat's input, and the timeout is the *next*
thing that actually needs doing — the next clock-minute boundary, the next
one-second tick of a lockout while one is counting down, the next frame of a
running animation or of the ribbon, or the moment the display is owed its
sleep, whichever is nearer. A sleeping screen's wait has no timeout at all, so
it arms no timer. There is no poll loop and no yield.

The surface animates four things — the chooser's selection mark, the travel
between the chooser and the secret prompt, a shake on a refusal, and the fade
to black on success — and reports the soonest frame any of them needs as one
deadline. Every duration is theme data; a reduced-motion theme makes all four
instant, which asks for no frames; the ribbon holds still under it too.

A wake drains the whole burst the seat is holding before it presents: every
record is applied, what each changed is merged into one rectangle, and the
display is called once with it. A present is a round trip and a moving mouse
outpaces the screen, so one per report would be one round trip per report. A
drain that changed nothing presents nothing.

## The pointer

The seat reports relative motion, so `screen` keeps the running position,
holds it inside the frame, and hands the surface the absolute position it
hit-tests. One seat report expands to at most two surface events — a button is
a move *and* a transition — and they present as one frame.

The built-in arrow is rasterised **once** at start-up for the active scale and
sampled over the surface as the frame is composed — never painted into it — so
it sits on top of everything the surface drew and the pixels beneath it
survive for when it moves off them. A move presents the union of the cursor's
old and new rectangles clipped to the screen — never the whole screen, and
never a cursor left where it no longer is — and a move the screen edge
swallows presents nothing.

That is what makes a moving mouse cheap. The rendered surface is kept and
rebuilt only when its own content changes — a keystroke, a verdict, a
countdown, a clock tick, a tile taking the focus, a raised ribbon — so a
report sliding the pointer across an unchanged screen re-composes a
cursor-sized patch of pixels that already exist and renders nothing at all.

The one thing that stops it being drawn is the screen leaving. From the first
veiled frame the composer is handed no cursor at all, and that frame covers the
whole screen, so the arrow is painted out where it sat. The position is still
tracked; a move nobody can see simply presents nothing.

## The ribbon behind the column

The screen stands over the minimal-clock screensaver's ribbon of light,
`lib/ribbon`: a layer of its own, repainted only in the strips a frame moved,
that the painted surface — transparent behind the column — is laid over one
scanline at a time as the frame is composed. A frame of the ribbon re-composes
what it moved and never paints the column; a keystroke never paints the ribbon.
The ribbon is kept clear of the centred column (`AuthSurface::column_rect`),
every line of text is shadowed in the ribbon's own black, and the screen is
drawn in the dark theme whatever the default appearance. Under reduced motion it holds
still. Nothing is read from disk or decoded, so the greeter holds no
filesystem authority and starts no process.

## Energy saving

After thirty minutes with no seat input of any kind the screen goes back to
rest — a fresh chooser, whatever was typed erased, no lockout shown — goes
black, and asks the display to switch off through `lib/display`'s
`DisplaySleep`. A display that cannot is kept showing the black. Asleep, the
screen presents nothing, moves no ribbon and arms no timer. The next input
reaches nothing behind it — the pointer still follows the hand — and wakes the
display: the screen arrives out of black as it first did. A display that will
not switch back on stays asleep until the next input asks again.

## The lockout is the account's

The authority meters each login name on its own, so the countdown is shown,
ticked and enforced only while the screen asks about the account it was
reported for; picking another account is never held behind it.

## Module map

* `events` — the stable audit event ids (`19000` range).
* `accounts` — the `SessionTransport` seam and the bounded paging walk that
  turns the authority's account pages into chooser tiles.
* `verify` — the `session-v1` client behind the surface's `Verifier`. The
  buffer that carries the secret is a `Wiped` field, sized once so encoding
  cannot reallocate and strand a copy, and erased on every path out.
* `chrome` — the two corner lines: `TAIRiX <version> (<host name>)` from the
  System Information identity at the top left, and the UTC date and time
  (`Wednesday 30 September 2026 14:05`) at the top right, told again only when
  the minute turns.
* `cursor` — the pointer position the seat's relative motion accumulates into,
  held inside the screen for every screen shape, and the built-in arrow
  resolved for a scale.
* `frame` — the surface-to-scan-out composition over the ribbon, the pointer
  sampled over both, the merge that turns a drain's changes into one present,
  and the black a sleeping display is left on.
* `scene` — the ribbon of light behind the column, its own layer.
* `wait` — the lockout countdown, the park deadline, the thirty-minute idle
  wait, and the frame budget that bounds the closing fade.
* `screen` — `LoginScreen`, the whole flow over those seams.

`src/run.rs` is the freestanding `Run` program: seat, frames, accounts, the
ribbon, first paint, park, sleep and wake, and the closing fade. It is an inert
stub on the host, so host tooling never links the userland runtime.

## Why the freestanding build enables extra crate features

Several `lib/*` crates the screen draws and queries through are seam-injected
by default and only reach the running system when their runtime feature is on.
The host build wants the seams (tests inject mocks); the real `Run` program
wants the syscalls, so the `program` feature turns each on under
`cfg(target_os = "none")`:

| Crate | Feature | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| `tairix-font` | `rt` | no font-service transport is installed, **every glyph request fails closed, and the screen draws no text at all** |
| `tairix-procinfo` | `program` | no System Information transport, so the identity line names the OS alone |

`tairix-display` is deliberately **not** given its `rt` feature: that gates the
display *service*'s shared-memory mapper, and the greeter is a client — it maps
its own frame ring through `tairix-rt` directly.

## Tests

Everything about *what the screen does* is host-testable behind the injected
seams, and `tests/session_v1.rs` additionally wires the transport seam straight
to the authority's own `handle_session_request` — a **test-only** edge, so the
two halves of one protocol are proven against each other rather than each
against its own mock.

`src/run.rs` is compiled out of every host build, so nothing on the host can
check it. Building and linting it for a real target is what does:

```
cargo test -p tairix-greeter-service
cargo clippy -p tairix-greeter-service --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings

for t in aarch64-unknown-none riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf .cargo/x86_64-tairix-none.json; do
  cargo clippy -p tairix-greeter-service --bin tairix-greeter-service-run \
    --target "$t" -Z build-std=core,alloc,compiler_builtins --no-deps -- -D warnings
done
```
