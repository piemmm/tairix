//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the graphical login screen, installed at
//! `/System/Services/greeter.app/Run` — the screen the `login` authority
//! spawns as the `greeter` service account to ask who is at the machine
//! (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` G3).
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: it links the Rust userland runtime
//! `tairix-rt` for `_start`, the stack canary, the panic handler, the
//! `#[global_allocator]`, and the seat / shared-memory / wait-set / IPC /
//! clock syscall wrappers. `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Acquire the boot seat's exclusive lease, query the display mode, map a
//! double-buffered frame region and grant it to the display service, page the
//! offerable accounts off `SESSION_ENDPOINT`, raise the ribbon of light behind
//! the column, paint the first frame, and then **park**: one wait set holding
//! the seat's input, with a timeout set to the next thing that actually needs
//! a repaint — the ribbon's next frame among them.
//!
//! Left untouched for the energy-saving wait, the screen goes back to rest
//! and black and its display is switched off, or kept black where it cannot
//! be; from then on it presents nothing and arms no timer until input wakes
//! it, and the gesture that does reaches nothing behind it.
//!
//! A verified secret fades the screen to black and then exits `0`; the
//! authority is watching for that exit and starts the session itself, and the
//! desktop comes up out of the same black. The fade is bounded and cannot
//! fail: a lost seat, a refused present, or a stopped clock ends it early and
//! the exit is still `0`. Everything else keeps asking.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
