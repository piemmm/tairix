//! The full-screen curses login view.
//!
//! [`CursesView`] is the production [`LoginView`]: a full-screen terminal
//! page drawn through `lib/curses` that tells whoever is at the console
//! *which system they are logging in to*. The layout is:
//!
//! * a top status bar (white on blue) — machine name, OS version/build,
//!   and the current wall-clock time on the right;
//! * a cyan-bordered login box in the middle of the screen carrying the
//!   `Username:` prompt (which becomes the `Password:` prompt — unechoed,
//!   showing the shared `[input active...]` marker instead, its dots
//!   animated by the shared [`tairix_vt::secret`] timer cadence, exactly
//!   as every hidden field does);
//! * a running `N failed attempts` line in red beneath the box after any
//!   rejected attempt, accumulating until a session launches;
//! * a bottom status bar (white on blue) — memory in use, task count,
//!   logged-in users, and the 1/5/15-minute load averages.
//!
//! The machine identity and figures come through the injected
//! [`StatusSource`] (on a running system: the `sysinfod` queries and the
//! kernel wall clock), so the whole view is host-testable over an
//! in-memory [`Tty`]. A figure the source cannot supply — a refused or
//! unavailable query — renders as `--`: the refusal is reported in the
//! view and the login session carries on (a denied optional query is an
//! answer, never a fatal error).
//!
//! **Refresh model.** The console read waits with a bound: the kernel
//! parks the reader until a keystroke arrives or the bound elapses (a
//! one-shot deadline, never a poll). While the secret marker is animating
//! the bound is its next one-second frame (the shared
//! [`tairix_vt::secret`] cadence); otherwise it is `REFRESH_INTERVAL`.
//! The [`StatusSource`]'s monotonic clock is read once after every wait,
//! and any animation frame whose deadline has passed is advanced before
//! the event is handled — so the dots keep moving while keystrokes keep
//! arriving and freeze only once the bounded idle window after the most
//! recent keystroke elapses. Each elapsed bound re-queries the
//! [`StatusSource`] and repaints, so the clock and figures stay current
//! while the prompt sits idle. A timed tick surfaces as an empty
//! [`Screen::getch`]; a dead console surfaces as a channel error and
//! fails the read closed, exactly as before.
//!
//! On [`session_handoff`](LoginView::session_handoff) the view leaves the
//! alternate screen and restores the cooked input discipline, handing the
//! terminal to the launched session; the next round re-enters it.
