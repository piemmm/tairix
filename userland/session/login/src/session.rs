//! Login's identity types and the seams through which it reaches the
//! outside world.
//!
//! The [`Login`](crate::Login) state machine is otherwise pure: it drives
//! the prompt/authenticate/launch sequence and decides *what* to do, but it
//! never itself talks to the kernel, the credential store, or the terminal.
//! Three injected traits do that:
//!
//! * [`LoginView`] presents the login screen and reads the username and password from
//!   the controlling terminal.
//! * [`Authenticator`] verifies a [`Credentials`] pair against `kernel/sec`
//!   and the credential store, returning the [`AuthenticatedUser`] on success.
//! * [`SessionLauncher`] starts the chosen [`SessionKind`] under the
//!   authenticated user's identity and capability ceiling.
//!
//! On a running kernel these are backed by syscalls and `kernel/sec`; in
//! tests they are in-memory fixtures. This mirrors `init`'s `Spawner`/`Reaper`
//! split and keeps every control-flow and policy decision testable without a
//! kernel.
