//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the login service, installed at
//! `/System/Services/login.app/Run` (`plans/PI.md` P11) — the
//! program PID 1 `init` launches as the per-console session supervisor.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so
//! it links the Rust userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which
//! exists solely for programs **not** written in Rust.
//! `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global allocator, and the
//! syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` wires the real seams the [`tairix_login::Login`] state machine
//! drives and supervises sessions on this console:
//!
//! * [`tairix_login::LoginView`] as the full-screen curses view
//!   ([`tairix_login::CursesView`]) over the **inherited standard
//!   streams**: rendered bytes go to fd 1, keystrokes come from fd 0. The
//!   view selects the raw (echo-off) discipline through the
//!   `stream_input_mode` syscall for the whole page — it echoes the
//!   username itself and renders nothing for the password — and refuses a
//!   password read outright if raw mode cannot be selected (never echo a
//!   credential). Its status bars query `sysinfod` (identity, memory,
//!   load/task/user censuses) and the kernel wall clock; a refused or
//!   unavailable figure renders as a placeholder and never blocks a login.
//! * [`tairix_login::UsersAuthenticator`] over the user database obtained
//!   through the capability-gated `users_db_read` syscall (`CAP_USERS_READ`) and re-parsed with the fail-closed `tairix-users`
//!   parser. When no database is held — an installer image, or the boot
//!   read refused the record — a deny-all authenticator is wired instead,
//!   so the prompt stays up and **every** login is refused (fail closed, never invent an account).
//! * [`tairix_login::SessionLauncher`] through the `spawn` syscall: the
//!   authenticated
//!   record's **shell of choice** is spawned and supervised; the session's
//!   exit code is reported back to the login loop.
//! * [`tairix_login::handle_elevate_request`] over this console's reserved
//!   elevation call endpoint (`plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU5): while the
//!   session runs, the supervision wait multiplexes the shell child with the
//!   endpoint, so an `elevate <user> <program>` request from the session's
//!   shell is re-authenticated (same authenticator as the prompt,
//!   timing-equalised, refusals indistinguishable) and its command run as
//!   the target account while the shell blocks in its `ipc_call`. The same
//!   endpoint also answers a caller's own `Verify`-only request — no
//!   program runs, and the account checked is the caller's kernel-attested
//!   uid (read off the same `call_peer_origin` result as the console),
//!   never a name the request supplies. Binding the reserved id requires
//!   login's `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`; when no rendezvous can be bound the
//!   failure is audited and sessions simply run without a broker (requests
//!   fail closed at the missing endpoint).
//! * [`tairix_login::handle_session_request`] over the reserved `session-v1`
//!   endpoint (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` G4), multiplexed on that same
//!   wait-set. A round that can be graphical starts the login screen as the
//!   unprivileged `greeter` service account, serves it until a verdict is
//!   accepted, then starts — or resumes — that account's desktop. A session
//!   that asks to step aside keeps its processes and its place in the
//!   session table while the login screen comes back up.
//!
//! Each completed session (or exhausted attempt budget) loops back to a
//! fresh `login:` prompt — login supervises this console's sessions. A dead
//! console (a failed read) exits instead, first telling every session still
//! on the table to end, since nothing could wake one once this process is
//! gone; PID 1 `init` supervises login itself and relaunches it
//! (`plans/SPAWN.md` SP6).
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
