//! The desktop's **input seat**: one pointer, one keyboard, and the decision
//! about which surface each event belongs to.
//!
//! The session owns a seat — one display plus the keyboard and pointer
//! attached to it (`lib/seat`, `docs/src/desktop/seat.md`) — and this is where
//! that seat's input is routed once it has arrived inside the session.
//!
//! The desktop has two independent input routers — the window manager's
//! [`InputRouter`] (focus, click-to-activate, interactive move- and
//! resize-grabs, every application window and the desktop layer behind them)
//! and the taskbar's [`TaskbarInput`] (the bar, its program-library popup, its
//! context menus, the hover window picker, the notification popover, and the
//! Switchboard capsule's readout) — and both consume the **same** shared
//! `tairix_input` (`lib/input`) event vocabulary. A real input source produces
//! one stream, so something must decide which router each event belongs to.
//! Neither GUI crate may depend on the other, so that decision is session
//! glue, and [`SessionInputRouter`] is that glue.
//!
//! # Why a seat, and not two routers guessing
//!
//! Each router knows its own geometry. Neither can see the *stack*, and
//! without the stack geometry is not an answer: the bar's clock stays at the
//! bar's coordinates when a window is dragged across it, so a router that
//! hit-tested only its own rectangles would act on gestures the user aimed at
//! the window in front of it — a click doing something on a control that is
//! not even visible, hover feedback lighting up beneath someone else's window,
//! a popover opening over it. Nothing pins the bar topmost; it is an ordinary
//! compositor window, and every application window is raised above it the
//! moment it is opened or clicked.
//!
//! So the seat owns the two facts neither router can: **where the pointer is**,
//! and **which surface it rests on**. It resolves the second before it
//! delivers anything, hands the event to that one router, and tells the other
//! that the pointer has left — the enter/leave pair
//! ([`PointerFocus`]) every window system needs,
//! for exactly the reason every window system needs it.
//!
//! # The policy
//!
//! One event does exactly one thing, and it happens where the user was
//! looking:
//!
//! * **A modal surface of the bar's holds the pointer.** While the bar's
//!   context menu or its program-library popup is open, every pointer event
//!   and every key routes to the taskbar, wherever the pointer is. That is an
//!   *active grab* in the ordinary window-system sense, and it is what lets a
//!   press anywhere dismiss the surface (the click-away) without also acting
//!   on what it landed on. Nothing leaks to the windows beneath.
//! * **A held button holds the pointer.** The first press takes an implicit
//!   grab for whichever surface it landed on, and every event up to the
//!   release of the *last* button goes there — so a window drag that runs
//!   under the bar keeps dragging, a Switchboard capsule press that slides off
//!   the capsule still resolves on the capsule's own terms, and a release can
//!   never be claimed by a surface that did not see the press. There is no
//!   "offer it to one and then the other": the surface that took the press
//!   owns the gesture.
//! * **Otherwise the stack decides.** The surface the compositor finds drawn
//!   under the pointer ([`Compositor::window_at`]) gets the event: the
//!   taskbar when that window is one the [`TaskbarPresenter`] placed, the
//!   window manager for anything else — an application window, a session
//!   dialog, the lock screen, or the desktop layer when there is no window at
//!   all. The test is per event position, never per surface: a window covering
//!   the bar's trailing end leaves every button it does not cover still the
//!   bar's.
//! * **Motion is delivered, not fanned.** Only the surface holding the pointer
//!   is told the pointer moved, so only it updates hover feedback and resolves
//!   pointer gestures. The other is told the pointer *left*, which is the only
//!   way a hover can end: when a window rises over a hovered control the
//!   pointer has not moved at all, and re-testing its unchanged position would
//!   answer "still hovered" and strand the highlight — and any popover it
//!   opened — over the window now in front of it.
//! * **Keys follow the keyboard, not the pointer.** They go to the window
//!   manager, which delivers them to the focused window; the taskbar takes
//!   them only while one of its modal surfaces is open. A pointer resting on
//!   the bar never diverts a keystroke from the window the user is typing in.
//!
//! # What this is worth beyond correctness
//!
//! The bar is *trusted* desktop chrome: its menus can offer to lock the
//! screen, to log out, to re-authenticate for a privileged application. An
//! unprivileged window that could drive that chrome's state — provoke a
//! popover to appear over itself at a moment it chose, or have a click it
//! received acted on by a control the user could not see — would have a
//! user-interface redressing primitive. Resolving every pointer event against
//! the stack, in one place, is what denies it: chrome reacts only to input the
//! user actually directed at chrome. It is the same reason the lock screen is
//! safe here — its window is not one the presenter placed, so while it is up
//! the bar cannot be reached by the pointer at all.
//!
//! The seat holds no pixels and grants itself no authority: it owns the two
//! inner routers and drives them against the embedder's [`Compositor`],
//! [`Taskbar`], and [`TaskbarPresenter`], passed in on each
//! [`handle`](SessionInputRouter::handle). Composing the taskbar and
//! window-manager crates is the permitted `userland/gui/*` edge; nothing
//! outside `userland/gui/*` depends on this glue. It never panics: every
//! routed sub-call is itself total and fails closed.
