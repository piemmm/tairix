//! The session's icon bar: which applications hold a slot, what each one
//! declared, and how a window is reached through the one that owns it.
//!
//! The bar shows *applications*, and an application here is one
//! kernel-attested process. Two facts put a process on the bar, and either
//! alone is enough:
//!
//! * it **declared** an icon-bar presence over the window channel
//!   ([`AppBarService::declare`]), which keeps its slot for the life of the
//!   process whether it owns a window or not — so *Quit* stays meaningful
//!   and "open a fresh window" stays reachable;
//! * it **owns a window**, which gives it a slot even with no declaration,
//!   so no window is ever unreachable. Such a slot has no menu, and its
//!   click is one the session answers by raising: it invents neither on an
//!   application's behalf.
//!
//! A bundle whose *signed* manifest sets `APPINFO_FLAG_NO_ICON_BAR` is the
//! one exception, and it overrides both: the desktop already reaches it
//! another way — the Switchboard through the bar's own permanent capsule,
//! Settings through the system and backdrop menus — so a slot would be a
//! second route to the same window. The claim lives in the manifest and not
//! on the window channel because a running process must not be able to hide
//! itself from the bar; and its windows stay ordinary tasks, so the capsule's
//! task cycling still reaches one that was minimised.
//!
//! Slots keep the order the session first saw each process in, so the strip
//! never reshuffles under the pointer. A process leaves the bar when it has
//! neither a declaration nor a window left — which, for a declaring
//! application, is when the window engine proved the process gone and
//! withdrew its declaration.
//!
//! **Identity is the kernel's answer, never the process's, and never the
//! desktop's launch bookkeeping.** A slot stands for one process, and the
//! bundle it belongs to is the [`AppIdentity`](tairix_abi::AppIdentity) the
//! *kernel* attested for that process from the manifest the load gate
//! verified — so it is the same answer whoever started the process: the
//! desktop, a shell, or another application. The label, icon, and information
//! panel are then read from that bundle's own `AppInfo`, which the
//! [`BundleIndex`] resolves to a directory by walking the installed stores and
//! accepting a path only where the manifest there declares **both** the
//! attested identifier and the attested publisher. Matching the identifier
//! alone would let a bundle planted in a user-writable store supply the name,
//! purpose, author, and icon drawn in system chrome for a shipped application.
//!
//! A process with no attested identity — one not admitted through the signed
//! bundle gate, or whose identifier the identity grammar refuses — keeps the
//! neutral label and carries no version or author at all, and so does one
//! whose bundle the index has not resolved yet. Identity is stated when it is
//! attested and never otherwise.
