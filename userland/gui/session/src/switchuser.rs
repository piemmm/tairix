//! The desktop session's half of **fast user switching**
//! (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-LOGIN.md` G5): stepping aside so somebody else can
//! log in, parking while another account holds the screen, and being woken
//! back to exactly the session that was left.
//!
//! Switching away is not logging out. Everything in the session keeps
//! running — an editor keeps its unsaved buffer, a build finishes, every
//! served window stays open — but the session presents nothing and drains
//! no seat input, because it no longer owns the seat.
//!
//! # The order is the safety property
//!
//! [`SwitchUser::step_aside`] asks the authority *first* and gives up the
//! screen only on [`SessionVerdict::Accepted`]. Releasing the seat before
//! the authority has agreed to put the login screen back up would leave the
//! display owned by nobody and drawn by nobody. A refusal, a reply that
//! does not decode, and a transport failure are one answer: stay exactly as
//! we are (fail closed).
//!
//! # Who may wake us
//!
//! The wake mailbox is unforgeable by construction — the kernel attests
//! every sender's [`Origin`] — but it is an ordinary, unreserved id, so
//! anything could *send* to it. [`SwitchUser::classify`] therefore honours
//! a message only from a principal on this session's own console holding
//! `CAP_IPC_BIND_PRIVILEGED`, which is the authority that alone may serve
//! the reserved session rendezvous. The authority's account is a
//! configured one, so the check is the capability and the console rather
//! than a uid guessed here. A message that does not decode, or whose
//! sender does not clear that bar, is dropped and stated — never acted on.
//!
//! The wake carries no authority of its own: it says "you are foreground",
//! and the kernel's seat exclusivity is what decides who may actually
//! present. A session that finds the seat taken reports and ends rather
//! than sitting invisible.
//!
//! # Parking
//!
//! A background session parks with no deadline at all
//! ([`SwitchUser::park_deadline_ns`]): it has nothing to redraw and nothing
//! to poll, so a timer would only wake a core to do nothing. A cache-report
//! change the runtime's rate limiter is holding back at that moment goes
//! out on the next wake instead of arming one.
