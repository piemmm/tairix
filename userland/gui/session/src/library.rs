//! Loading the program-library catalog the taskbar's popup lists
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5).
//!
//! The catalog is two layers resolved into one view by `tairix_proglib::merge`:
//!
//! - the **machine-wide** store under `/System/Settings/ProgramLibrary/`,
//!   read as a file. It is machine policy rather than any one application's
//!   data — every account reads it, and only a principal that tree's policy
//!   admits may rewrite it — so it stays an ordinary administrator document
//!   beside the machine's network and configuration stores. Reading it needs
//!   a filesystem capability, which is why it is the desktop session's job:
//!   the `no_std` popup model receives the already-merged [`Catalog`] as a
//!   typed view and never touches the VFS.
//! - the logged-in user's **overlay**, read from the library-admin command's
//!   *published* app-data scope (`plans/APPDATA.md` §3.11). That layer is
//!   per-user, per-application data, and every other application of the
//!   account could previously read *and rewrite* it — a hostile program could
//!   file a launcher row named "Terminal" against a bundle of its choosing.
//!   The session now reads it by naming the publisher on a request shape that
//!   carries no scope field, so it can obtain what `applib` publishes about
//!   the account's library and nothing else `applib` keeps.
//!
//! Loading is **total and fail-closed per layer**: an absent layer is the
//! ordinary fresh-installation state (an empty catalog, no complaint), while
//! one that is unreadable, oversized, non-UTF-8, or malformed contributes an
//! empty catalog *and* a ready-to-print warning line — the desktop degrades
//! to a calm empty library and says why on `stderr`, rather than guessing at
//! a half-read store or dying over a settings file.
