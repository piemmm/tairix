//! The desktop session's **trusted file picker** (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW5,
//! `plans/CAPABILITY_USE.md` CU6).
//!
//! When an app asks the window channel to pick a file
//! (`WindowRequest::PickFile`), the *session* — not the app — browses the
//! filesystem: the picker is a session-owned window driven by the one
//! shared `lib/browse` engine (the same model and renderer the files app
//! composes), listing directories under the session's own identity and
//! authority. The app never sees a path it was not handed and never
//! browses anything itself; it receives exactly one conclusion — a
//! one-shot `fd_grant` delegation for the chosen file, or a cancellation
//! — delivered over its ordinary event channel.
//!
//! [`SessionPicker`] is the host-testable engine: the single picker slot
//! (one pick UI at a time, the session's modality policy), the browser
//! state, and the key/click navigation that concludes in a
//! [`PickConclusion`]. The privileged tail — opening the chosen file and
//! minting the delegation — stays in the session's `Run` binary, which
//! holds the syscalls; the engine only ever reports *what* was chosen.
//!
//! [`PickerSlot`] is the narrow face the window-channel bridge
//! ([`ShellWindowHost`](crate::ShellWindowHost)) drives: accepting a
//! validated pick request, and aborting a pick whose requesting window
//! died. Keeping the trait object-safe keeps the bridge non-generic.
