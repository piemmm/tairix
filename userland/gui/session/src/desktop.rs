//! The desktop: the user's own `Desktop` folder shown as a column of icons
//! down the screen edge their settings name (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T7,
//! `plans/PINBOARD.md`).
//!
//! The desktop is a *directory view*, not a new kind of surface. It lists the
//! user's `Desktop` folder through the same [`DirectorySource`] seam the
//! trusted file picker uses, under the session's own identity; it orders the
//! listing with the shared [`sort_entries`]; it classifies each child with the
//! shared content-type registry; and it lays its tiles out with the shared
//! [`GridView`], differing from the file manager's grid only in its
//! [`GridFlow`] and [`GridFill`] — the desktop's column hugs the edge the
//! user's arrangement names, grows a new column inward as it fills, and keeps
//! a fixed pitch so an icon does not drift when the work area changes size.
//! There is no second grid, no second sort, and no second classifier anywhere
//! in this module.
//!
//! # The pinboard settings live here
//!
//! The desktop owns the user's [`DesktopSettings`] — the wallpaper and its
//! fit, the backdrop colour, the icon arrangement, and the sort order — as the
//! single copy inside the session: the shell reads them from the desktop
//! rather than holding a second set that could drift from the one the icons
//! are actually laid out by. An edit arrives through
//! [`Desktop::apply_settings`], which reports exactly the work it implies, so
//! changing the sort order does not decode a wallpaper and changing the
//! wallpaper does not re-read the folder.
//!
//! What the desktop *owns* is the behaviour a folder-on-the-screen needs:
//! hover feedback, a selection, keyboard navigation while it holds focus, and
//! activation. Each of those reuses the pure engine that already decides it —
//! [`DoubleClickTracker`] for "is this the second click?" — so the desktop can
//! never disagree with the file manager about what a gesture means.
//!
//! # Shortcuts point *into* the desktop, never out of it
//!
//! The program library's row menu asks this folder for a shortcut
//! ([`Desktop::shortcut_to`]) and never the other way round. A `.app`
//! directory a user drops on their own `Desktop` is a directory *shaped* like
//! an application, not a catalogued one, so the desktop is not a source a
//! launcher can be populated from; the library's rows are catalogued entries
//! by construction (see [`tairix_taskbar::LibraryPopup`]) and are what a
//! shortcut is made from.
//!
//! # Why the re-list is gesture-driven
//!
//! There is no filesystem-change notification in this system: nothing tells a
//! process that a directory it is showing has gained a file. The desktop
//! therefore re-lists at the moments a change could plausibly have happened
//! and the user is about to look: at bring-up, after an action the session
//! itself performed that could have altered the folder, and when the pointer
//! arrives on the desktop having been somewhere else. It runs **no timer and
//! no polling loop** — a periodically-waking desktop would keep a core busy
//! and burn power to discover nothing, which is exactly the busy-poll this
//! system forbids. The pointer-arrival re-list is rate-limited by
//! [`RELIST_MIN_INTERVAL_NS`] so sweeping the mouse on and off the desktop
//! cannot turn a gesture into a re-listing loop.
//!
//! The model holds no authority: it *names* what should happen
//! ([`DesktopAction`]) and the embedder — which holds the spawn and
//! filesystem capabilities — carries it out.
