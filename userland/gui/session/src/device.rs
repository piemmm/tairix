//! Backing the desktop's [`InputSource`] with a live device channel.
//!
//! [`DesktopShell`](crate::DesktopShell) drives the desktop by
//! [`pump`](crate::DesktopShell::pump)ing an injected [`InputSource`] — the
//! one seam through which pointer events reach the desktop. This module is the
//! *live* backing for that seam: [`DeviceInputSource`] reads framed
//! [`PointerInput`] records from a kernel input channel and decodes each into
//! the desktop's `lib/input` [`InputEvent`] vocabulary the window manager and
//! taskbar route.
//!
//! The seat channel is deliberately **screen-independent**: a driver injects
//! relative displacements ([`PointerInput::MovedBy`]) and resolved button
//! edges, because only the seat owner — this desktop session, which owns the
//! compositor — knows the screen's pixel extent. [`DeviceInputSource`] is
//! where that policy lives: it holds the absolute pointer position, starts it
//! at the screen's centre, accumulates each displacement with saturating
//! arithmetic, and clamps the result to the screen rectangle, so the pointer
//! can never leave the screen no matter what a (compromised) injector sends.
//! Construction refuses an empty screen outright (fail closed). It is also
//! where the user's pointer policy is applied — the button order and the
//! speed — so no surface above it ever sees the unmapped form, and where a
//! wheel's detents become accelerated scroll units.
//!
//! The raw bytes arrive through an injected [`PointerInputChannel`] seam — a
//! capability-checked kernel input channel on a running system, an in-memory
//! queue in tests — so this `userland/gui` crate holds no
//! input capability of its own and the decode runs above the device, not
//! inside it. Every record is validated by
//! [`PointerInput::from_bytes`] before it becomes an [`InputEvent`]; a
//! malformed record surfaces its [`Errno`] and the shell's
//! [`pump`](crate::DesktopShell::pump) stops without misinterpreting the bytes.
//!
//! [`InputSource`]: crate::InputSource
