//! Preparing the desktop's wallpaper off the session's event loop
//! (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md` DESK-4).
//!
//! Painting the backdrop means reading a user-chosen image file — up to
//! `tairix_wallpaper::MAX_WALLPAPER_BYTES` of untrusted bytes — and decoding and
//! fitting it in a capability-empty sandbox worker. Run on the session's own
//! task that is a visible stall at login and again on every settings change: a
//! file read from a slow disk, then a round trip through another process.
//!
//! [`WallpaperDesk`] is the arrangement's whole policy, and it holds no lock, no
//! thread, and no syscall: what the desktop wants painted, what has come back,
//! and the staleness rule that discards a picture prepared for a screen or a
//! choice the desktop has since moved on from. The `Run` binary wraps it in the
//! runtime's futex mutex and parks a worker on a condition variable over it.
//!
//! # Its own sandbox worker, deliberately
//!
//! The icon rasteriser's sandbox worker stays where it is, driven from the
//! session's own task through the handle it has always used. The wallpaper's
//! worker thread owns a **second** one, created inside the thread, so no sandbox
//! handle ever has to cross a thread boundary and the icon path is not changed
//! by any of this. The cost is one more capability-empty process per session; it
//! buys a desktop that comes up without waiting for a picture.
//!
//! # The choosers' previews share the same worker
//!
//! The Settings application browses the shipped pictures through the desktop
//! rather than reading them itself — the wallpapers, and each screensaver's
//! preview — so a chooser's picture is prepared here too: the same read, the
//! same sandbox, the same thread. One preview is in flight at a time across
//! the whole desktop — a bound on how much decoding any set of clients can
//! queue, and the reason the backdrop is always taken first: the picture the
//! user is actually looking at never waits behind a thumbnail.
//!
//! Nothing is ever recalled. A render already taken cannot be, and every
//! accepted one answers exactly once, so a window that closes mid-render
//! costs one wasted decode into a region only the desktop still maps, and
//! the slot frees itself. Recalling it would mean a second record of which
//! preview is in flight, and two records of one fact are a fact that can
//! disagree with itself.
//!
//! # A wallpaper is never load-bearing
//!
//! Every refusal — an unreadable file, one larger than any wallpaper, a
//! malformed image, a crashed worker, a reply that does not fill the screen —
//! answers "no surface", and the desktop paints its backdrop colour. The reason
//! travels *with* the answer rather than being written where it was noticed:
//! `stderr` is one descriptor and a formatted line reaches it in several writes,
//! so two threads stating something at once would interleave into an unreadable
//! diagnosis. The session states it, once, on its own thread. The desktop never
//! fails over a picture.
