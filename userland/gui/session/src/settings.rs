//! The session's ownership of the user's pinboard settings: the scope they
//! live in, and the one policy that decides whether a foreign caller's
//! *apply* request may be honoured (`plans/PINBOARD.md` §2, §6,
//! `plans/APPDATA.md` §3.11).
//!
//! Settings are per-user configuration (`lib/wallpaper`), kept in this
//! application's own **published** app-data scope. Two properties come from
//! the store rather than from anything written here, and both replace a rule
//! this module used to have to enforce itself:
//!
//! - The session is the store's only **writer**, by construction: an
//!   application publishes only its own scope, so no other program the user
//!   launches — including the Settings application — can write the
//!   desktop's document at all. Every change, whether the backdrop menu
//!   asked for it or Settings did, is applied by the session and the desktop adopts it
//!   **only after the write succeeded** — and the write happens on the
//!   session's settings worker, never on its serve loop, so the compositor
//!   does not stop while a disk is written. Memory and disk can never diverge,
//!   and neither can freeze the desktop.
//! - Any application may **read** it, through one request shape that carries
//!   no scope field, so "read the desktop's private settings" is not a
//!   request that exists. That is what replaces the hand-rolled
//!   `~/Settings/Pinboard/pinboard.conf` path the chooser used to open
//!   directly — a file every application of that user could also rewrite.
//!
//! Nothing here spells a path or names a bundle: the app-data service derives
//! the store from the identity the kernel attested for this task.
//!
//! The apply channel's decision is here, not beside the serve loop, so it is
//! host-testable without a running kernel: the caller's uid is the
//! kernel-attested one the embedder reads off the endpoint, and this module
//! reads the carried document with the same registry the store's own document
//! is read with. Nothing here performs I/O, so the path the document names is
//! read later, by the session, under the session's own identity — a caller can
//! never use this channel to reach a file it could not read itself.
