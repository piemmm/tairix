//! Bookkeeping for the desktop's launched children and operator-facing
//! diagnosis for a launch that failed to load.
//!
//! Asynchronous process launch (`plans/FIX-DESKTOP.md`) admits a child and
//! returns its PID to the desktop immediately; the load — the VFS read of the
//! bundle, the signature/hash verification, and the address-space build —
//! then runs on the *child's own* task, so the compositor loop never freezes
//! behind it. A refusal therefore no longer comes back as the `spawn` return
//! value; it surfaces as the child's **exit status**, a reserved `LOAD_*`
//! code that `lib/abi` places in a high, loader-only band a normal program's
//! own `exit(code)` never lands in.
//!
//! [`LaunchTable`] remembers every launched child still running: its PID, the
//! display name the desktop reports it by, and the `Run` path it was spawned
//! from. The name feeds the fail-loud load-refusal diagnosis below; the path
//! is the child's *bundle identity*, which the file manager's idempotent open
//! resolves against — a press on its strip slot raises the running file
//! manager's window instead of spawning a second copy. Identity by recorded
//! spawn path is attested by construction: the desktop spawned the child
//! itself, so no window title or other app-controlled data is ever trusted
//! for it.
//!
//! The desktop reaps every exited child on its `CHILD_TOKEN` wait-set member.
//! [`launch_failure_report`] turns a reaped status into the terse line the
//! session prints on `stderr`, so a refused launch is a loud, non-fatal
//! diagnosis (the charter's fail-loud rule) instead of a window that silently
//! never appears. The reason wording is `lib/abi`'s shared mapping, so the
//! desktop and any other launcher describe the same cause identically.
