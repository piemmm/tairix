//! One seat wake's input, drained into whoever holds the seat.
//!
//! Routing one event can hand the seat to another holder — the menu chain,
//! the lock, another account's session — so a drain re-reads the holder
//! between events and never applies one against the holder it is about to
//! replace. What only the session program can act on (the window channel,
//! launches, the session authority) leaves through [`SeatRouter`], so the
//! drain itself is host-tested.
