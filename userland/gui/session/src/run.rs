//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `desktop` application, installed as
//! a signed bundle in the system application store (`/System/Applications/`)
//! and started two ways through the one bundle: a graphical login
//! (`os.loginType graphical`) spawns it as the authenticated user's
//! session, and a shell user starts it on demand by typing `desktop`
//! (`plans/DISPLAY.md` D7c, `plans/APPS.md`). The reserved `-h`/`-?`
//! switches serve the command's own short help; the grammar is otherwise
//! closed (see [`tairix_desktop_session::cli`]).
//!
//! This is the client half of the zero-copy, lease-gated present path: the
//! session acquires the boot seat's exclusive, revocable lease, brings the
//! display client up over the reserved `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT` (query the mode →
//! create the shared double-buffered frame region → grant it to the display
//! service → configure), and then runs the desktop from its wait-set: it
//! parks on a `SeatInput` member (woken by input delivery *and* by lease
//! loss), drains the owned seat's pointer and keyboard channels through the
//! session crate's fail-closed record path, pumps each decoded event
//! through the `DesktopShell`, and presents the composited damage by
//! frame index — no frame bytes ever cross the IPC.
//!
//! It is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt`, never the C ABI (which exists solely for
//! non-Rust programs). `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the per-process stack
//! canary, the panic handler, the allocator, and the syscall wrappers;
//! `tairix_rt::entry!` names this program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` wires the real seams the shared engines drive:
//!
//! * `display_acquire(SEAT_PRIMARY)`: the kernel binds this task as the
//!   seat's owner and mints the revocable lease. Every later drain and
//!   present is owner-gated kernel-side against that live lease — the
//!   session holds no oracle and asserts nothing.
//! * `DisplayClient` over `ipc_call` to the reserved `DISPLAY_ENDPOINT`:
//!   the display service re-checks the caller's live lease per request via
//!   `call_peer_seat`, so a stale session cannot scribble on a switched
//!   seat.
//! * `shm_create` + `shm_grant`: the frame region is the session's own
//!   kernel-zeroed mapping, granted *to the serving task of the display
//!   endpoint* — never to a raw, recyclable PID.
//! * `SeatEventReader` over the seat-addressed `pointer_read` /
//!   `keyboard_read`: each drain is `CAP_INPUT_READ`- and owner-gated
//!   kernel-side; a truncated or malformed record fails closed in the
//!   session crate's one validation path, never decoding as a spurious
//!   event.
//! * The `SeatInput` wait-set member: the session parks between events —
//!   never a poll loop — and is woken by input *or* by losing the seat, so
//!   a revoked session observes the typed refusal on its very next drain
//!   and tears down fail-loud instead of parking forever or repainting
//!   blind.
//!
//! The session also binds the three seat-scoped rendezvous — the window
//! channel, the notification channel, and the Switchboard tray-summary
//! channel — and spawns the desktop's Switchboard monitor service as the
//! logged-in user at bring-up. The monitor's change-driven summaries feed
//! the taskbar capsule (each publish attested against the launch table);
//! the session's own delivery evidence (the `HangTracker` behind the event
//! sink) feeds the capsule's "not responding" count; and a monitor that
//! dies or was never there simply leaves the capsule calm
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T9/T10).
//!
//! Loss of the seat (`SeatRevoked` / `SeatNotOwner` on any drain or
//! present) ends the session with its reason on `stderr` and a reserved
//! exit code; the spawning supervisor decides whether a fresh session (with
//! a fresh acquire and a fresh configure) replaces it. Every other fault —
//! a dead display service, a refused wait-set, a malformed input record —
//! is equally fail-loud: the session never spins, never guesses a mode, and
//! never repaints without a live lease.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy,
//! and fmt still cover the file.
