//! Driving the whole desktop from one live input stream.
//!
//! The session crate already holds the desktop's pieces apart: the
//! [`DesktopSession`] (the theme registry + taskbar model), the
//! [`SessionInputRouter`] (which fans one pointer-event stream to the window
//! manager and taskbar routers), the [`TaskbarPresenter`] (which paints the
//! bar and its program-library popup into compositor windows), and the
//! [`TaskbarRenderer`] (which holds the across-frame glyph cache). Composing
//! them into one event-driven frontend was the long-open "feed the router and
//! presenter from live device events" thread; [`DesktopShell`] is that
//! composition.
//!
//! A real desktop runs a loop: read the pending pointer events, route each to
//! the right part of the desktop, perform the session-level effect of a
//! taskbar action (the light/dark toggle), and bring the on-screen bar back in
//! step. [`DesktopShell`] owns the four pieces and runs exactly that loop over
//! an injected [`InputSource`] seam — a real pointer/keyboard channel on a
//! running system, an in-memory queue in tests, the same
//! injected-seam shape the default apps use for their backing channels.
//!
//! The shell holds no framebuffer and grants itself no authority: the
//! [`Compositor`] is the embedder's (it owns the framebuffer capability) and is passed in on each call. Composing the taskbar
//! and window-manager GUI crates this way is the permitted `userland/gui/*`
//! edge; nothing outside `userland/gui/*` depends on this glue.
//! It never panics: every routed sub-call and every present is itself total and
//! fails closed. A session-level effect the shell cannot
//! perform with its own state — relaying the switched theme to the window
//! manager and apps, performing a session control, launching an app — is
//! surfaced as a [`ShellOutcome`] for the embedder, which holds those
//! capabilities, to act on.
//!
