//! Loading the desktop's on-disk SVG graphics assets from `/System/Graphics`.
//!
//! The desktop's cursors and notification icons are authored as SVG under
//! `/System/Graphics` — cursors in one directory per *set*, icons in one
//! flat directory (the SVG-first asset rule).
//! `lib/cursor` and `lib/icon` own the decode-and-fall-back logic but stay
//! `no_std` and hold no path of their own: they take the asset bytes through
//! the [`CursorAssetSource`] / [`IconAssetSource`] seams. Reading those bytes
//! needs a filesystem capability, so it is the desktop session's job. This module is that job.
//!
//! A caller supplies a [`SessionFileReader`] — VFS-backed on a running
//! system, an in-memory table in tests — and [`load_cursor_theme`] /
//! [`load_icon_set`] read one asset per kind, decode it, and assemble a
//! complete [`CursorTheme`] / [`IconSet`]. Both are **total and fail-closed
//! per kind**: a kind whose asset is absent, unreadable,
//! malformed, or outside the supported SVG subset keeps its built-in artwork,
//! so a missing or corrupt `/System/Graphics` can never blank the pointer or a
//! status icon — it simply yields the built-in set.

/// library crate's. On a running system this is backed by the VFS under the
/// session's own kernel-attested identity; tests back it with an in-memory
/// table. There is one seam, not one per consumer, so every session read
/// shares a single production implementation; the bound is the reader's,
