//! Keeping the taskbar's running-task list in step with the window stack.
//!
//! The taskbar models a window registry — one
//! [`TaskEntry`](tairix_taskbar::TaskEntry) per top-level window, read by
//! its hover window picker and its Switchboard capsule — but it owns no
//! window manager, and the window manager owns no task list. So joining the
//! two is session glue, and [`TaskBridge`] is that glue.
//!
//! A task is named by a [`TaskId`] and a window by a
//! [`WindowId`]; the window manager mints the latter as an
//! *opaque* token, so the bridge owns the correspondence between the two rather
//! than reaching into either id. It mints a stable [`TaskId`] for each window
//! it is told about and translates between the two whenever the taskbar acts on
//! a window or the window manager moves focus.
//!
//! The bridge's operations are each total and fail-closed:
//!
//! * [`open`](TaskBridge::open) adds a window to the compositor, registers it
//!   as a running task, and focuses it (a freshly opened window takes focus).
//!   [`open_unpresented`](TaskBridge::open_unpresented) does the first two for
//!   a served window whose client has yet to present anything, and
//!   [`map`](TaskBridge::map) does the third once it has.
//! * [`close`](TaskBridge::close) removes a window from the compositor and its
//!   task from the bar, dropping focus if the closed window held it.
//! * [`raise`](TaskBridge::raise) shows, raises, and focuses a task's window
//!   — what choosing a cell in the bar's window picker, or the bar's own
//!   raise-the-application click, asks for.
//! * [`sync_focus`](TaskBridge::sync_focus) mirrors a window-manager focus
//!   change (the user clicked a window directly) back into the bar's highlight.
//!
//! The bridge holds no pixels and grants itself no authority: the
//! [`Compositor`], the [`SessionInputRouter`], and the
//! [`Taskbar`] are the embedder's, passed in on each call.
