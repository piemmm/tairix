//! The desktop's one menu chain: the seat's singleton, and the only thing on
//! the system that renders a menu (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` §1).
//!
//! A chain is a root plate and the descendants open beneath it. A **plate** is
//! a title band over a column of rows: the shared [`TitleBar`] seating no
//! commands, and the shared [`Menu`]. A **child** is a submenu — more rows from
//! the same model — or one of the two surfaces the session draws itself: the
//! information panel, and the quick-entry field that owns the keyboard and
//! answers with the text it was given. All three hang where a submenu hangs and
//! die with the chain. A row may carry a command *and* a child, so clicking it
//! answers while arriving on it opens.
//!
//! The application describes and the desktop decides. A client hands over a
//! model and an anchor; everything after that — titling, placement, drawing,
//! the grab, routing, traversal, dismissal, and the one outcome — is the
//! session's. Nothing a client sends pins a chain open, no client draws a plate
//! pixel, and no client learns where the pointer is inside one.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the compositor. The chain owns the model, the state,
//! and the geometry; the session presents [`surfaces`](MenuChain::surfaces)
//! and tears down what the chain no longer lists. That is what lets every rule
//! in section 1 be tested without a screen.
