//! Serving the desktop-session half of the Switchboard command channel
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T11): the two owner-directed requests the
//! monitor's panel raises over other processes' windows
//! ([`SwitchboardRequest::ActivateOwner`] /
//! [`SwitchboardRequest::RestartOwner`]), and the reverse direction — the
//! tray-icon press that opens the panel, the seat's unresponsive-owner
//! report, what the last composited frame cost, and which installed bundle
//! each window owner's attested application resolves to — that the session
//! sends on the service's own command mailbox.
//!
//! Every side effect (raising a window, relaunching a bundle, sending on
//! the mailbox) is an injected seam ([`OwnerWindow`], the `relaunch`
//! closure, [`SwitchboardMailbox`]), so the decisions here — which owner is
//! valid, where an open with no live service is remembered, when a report
//! is worth sending — are pure and host-tested without a running kernel.
//!
//! The same endpoint carries the machine reports the System Monitor
//! screensaver draws ([`MachineReport`]), and [`MachineWatch`] decides when
//! the live instance is asked to publish them.
