//! Presenting the taskbar, its program-library popup, its hover window
//! picker, and its popovers through the window manager.
//!
//! The taskbar models the desktop's bar and produces a *rectangular* pixel
//! [`Surface`], and the window manager composites and
//! rounds windows; neither knows about the other. Joining
//! them is session glue, and [`TaskbarPresenter`] is that join: it paints the
//! bar (and, while open, the program-library popup and the hover window
//! picker) with the taskbar's own [`TaskbarRenderer`] and presents each as a
//! window in the [`Compositor`], placed at its computed screen origin. Each
//! surface rounds its own plate, so the compositor takes the shape as painted
//! ([`Corners::painted`]) — the silhouette its frost is weighted by and its
//! shadow is cut to — rather than cutting the corners a second time.
//!
//! The presenter owns only the compositor [`WindowId`]
//! tokens it minted; the taskbar model, the renderer (which holds the
//! across-frame glyph cache), and the compositor are the embedder's, passed in
//! on each [`present`](TaskbarPresenter::present) so the session crate composes
//! the GUI crates without owning the window-manager handle (composing `userland/gui/*` crates is the permitted edge).
//!
//! A surface already on screen keeps its pixels: the presenter paints what it
//! owes into the buffer the window holds ([`Compositor::repaint_window`]),
//! so the compositor marks the control that changed rather than the window's
//! whole bounds — the same treatment the desktop's menu plates get.
//!
//! It is **total and fails closed**: a paint whose pixels cannot be
//! allocated leaves whatever is already on screen untouched rather
//! than blanking the bar or panicking, and keeps what that surface owed so it
//! is drawn on a later present; the popup and picker windows are
//! removed from the compositor the moment each closes. If a presented window
//! has disappeared from the compositor (an embedder removed it), the next
//! present re-creates it rather than silently doing nothing.
