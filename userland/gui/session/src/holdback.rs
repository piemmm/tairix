//! The app-ward event hold-back: what the session owes a window whose
//! owner's mailbox was full.
//!
//! An app's event mailbox is a bounded kernel resource
//! ([`tairix_window::EVENT_MAILBOX_CAPACITY`]), so a send into it can be
//! refused with [`Errno::WouldBlock`] whenever the owner is merely slow.
//! Dropping the refused event is right for a *delta* — the next pointer
//! sample supersedes the one before it — and wrong for everything else: a
//! `Resized` the app never sees leaves it laying out at a size the
//! compositor no longer uses, a lost `Focus`/`Minimized`/`CloseRequested`
//! is a state edge with no second telling, and a lost
//! `FilePicked`/`PickCancelled` strands the window's picker for good
//! (the engine clears its pending pick only once the conclusion is
//! accepted). This module is what the session owes instead.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! One ordered queue per `(destination mailbox, window)`. Order within a
//! window is exactly the order the events happened; across an owner's
//! windows nothing is ordered, because nothing in the protocol relates two
//! windows' events. A flush therefore serves an owner's windows
//! round-robin — one event each per pass — so a window with a long backlog
//! cannot starve its sibling's `Resized`.
//!
//! An application-scoped event — an icon-bar click or menu outcome — names
//! no window, so it queues under the destination's `None` slot and takes
//! its turn beside the windows in the same round-robin. It is a *discrete*
//! occurrence: a *New window* row chosen twice must open two windows, so
//! neither folds into the other.
//!
//! # Folding
//!
//! Each kind folds by the rule its own quantity obeys, so a destination
//! that stays behind accumulates work in proportion to what the app still
//! needs to know rather than to how long it was away:
//!
//! * A **state edge** (`Focus`, `Resized`, `RedrawRequested`,
//!   `CloseRequested`, `Minimized`) is a value the app converges on, not an
//!   occurrence it must witness. A later one overwrites the held one where
//!   it stands, so one window owes at most one of each.
//! * A **position sample** (`Pointer`/`Moved`) is level-triggered: the
//!   newest supersedes an unbroken run of its predecessors.
//! * A **wheel delta** (`Scrolled`) is additive: a run in one direction
//!   sums. A reversal is a distinct gesture — a tick that clamped at a
//!   range end is not undone by the tick back — and ends the run, decided
//!   by the same `shell::continues` predicate the live drain uses.
//! * Everything else is **discrete** — a key, a button press or release, a
//!   pick conclusion — and every one is owed.
//!
//! # Bound
//!
//! [`HOLD_BACK_CAPACITY`] caps one window's queue. It is a defence, not a
//! capacity to scale: it is what stops an app that never drains from making
//! the desktop hold memory on its behalf, so it stays fixed. The rest of
//! the footprint is already bounded by the client's live windows, each of
//! which costs a mapped frame region orders of magnitude larger than its
//! queue.
//!
//! Overflow evicts the oldest *input* event, never a state edge and never a
//! pick conclusion — and that is total, not a preference: folding leaves a
//! window owing at most six state edges and at most one pick conclusion (a
//! second is refused before it reaches the sink), so a queue at capacity
//! always holds an input event to shed. Oldest-first is also the safe
//! direction for a button: a press is shed before its release, so the app
//! can be left with an unmatched release, never an unmatched press it would
//! hold as a latched grab.
