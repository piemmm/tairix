//! The session-side composition of served application windows
//! (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3).
//!
//! [`SessionWindows`] owns the session's window bookkeeping — the map
//! between the window channel's session-minted ids and the compositor's
//! [`WindowId`]s, plus each window's persistent content surface — and
//! [`ShellWindowHost`] is the [`WindowHost`](tairix_window::WindowHost) bridge the
//! `tairix_window::WindowServer` drives: an accepted `Create` opens a
//! desktop window (cascaded, focused, listed on the taskbar), a
//! validated `Present` converts exactly the damaged pixels of the app's
//! shared frame into the window's surface, and a `Close` (or a dead
//! client's teardown) removes the window and its task entry.
//!
//! The engine has already validated everything that reaches this bridge
//! (ownership, frame bounds, damage-in-surface); the bridge still
//! indexes fail-closed and refuses rather than guesses when a record and
//! its frame disagree.

/// * The **app-ward** half is produced only for a served window, which is
///   the only kind with a client to tell.
///
/// Per control:
///
/// * [`Close`](WindowControlKind::Close) never destroys the window behind
///   the app's back — it returns a [`WindowEvent::CloseRequested`] so the
///   app tears down cooperatively (it decides when, having saved). On a
///   session-owned window it does nothing here: what closing means is the
///   owner's (a cancelled pick, a declined prompt), so the embedder routes
///   it.
/// * [`Minimize`](WindowControlKind::Minimize) hides the window and marks
///   its taskbar entry minimised, and returns a
///   [`WindowEvent::Minimized`] so the app may pause non-essential work.
/// * [`PutToBack`](WindowControlKind::PutToBack) restacks the window to the
///   bottom, with no app-ward event.
/// * [`SizeToggle`](WindowControlKind::SizeToggle) maximizes or restores
///   the window against `work_area` and returns a [`WindowEvent::Resized`]
///   carrying the new client size so the app re-lays-out; it yields `None`
///   (nothing changes) for a window that cannot maximize.
