//! The desktop session's **credential prompt** for a command the signed-in
//! user is not authorised to perform.
//!
//! Setting the machine's clock needs `CAP_TIME_SET`, which a desktop session
//! does not hold and must never be able to acquire. So the session does not
//! perform the command: it asks for an account that *may*, and hands the
//! offered credentials to the per-console elevation broker — the login
//! supervisor that started this session — which re-authenticates the account
//! itself, audits the decision, and starts the program as that account. The
//! session learns only whether it was refused.
//!
//! What the prompt *asks* is the shared [`CredentialSheet`]: the desktop has
//! one credential surface, and the settings application composes the same
//! one inside its own window. This module owns only what is the session's —
//! the window the sheet is drawn in, the one-slot rule (a second request
//! while one is showing is refused rather than stacking a second prompt),
//! and the typed conclusion the embedder acts on once the window is already
//! closed.
//!
//! # The secret
//!
//! The password is held only in the sheet's masked field, which bounds its
//! buffer so it can never reallocate while filling and zeroises every byte
//! it discards — including on drop. The prompt therefore leaves no plaintext
//! behind on any exit: a cancellation, a refusal that clears the field for
//! another try, a successful launch, or the session being torn down around
//! it. Neither the offered password nor the account name reaches the system
//! log; only the broker audits the attempt.
//!
//! # Refusals
//!
//! A refused attempt leaves the prompt up with the reason stated and the
//! password cleared, so the user can try again without the surface
//! pretending anything happened. The broker refuses a wrong password, an
//! unknown account, and a locked account indistinguishably, and this prompt
//! repeats exactly what it was told rather than guessing which it was.
