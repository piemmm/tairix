//! The taskbar clock's wall-time reading and its once-a-minute tick.
//!
//! The bar itself holds only the *string* it draws
//! ([`tairix_taskbar::Clock`]) and carries no time ABI. This is the session
//! side: it reads the wall clock, spells the reading `HH:mm`, and says when
//! the label next goes stale.
//!
//! # UTC, because there is no other truth here
//!
//! TAIRiX keeps no timezone offset, so the reading is UTC and the shared
//! [`CivilTime`] breakdown is what turns an absolute instant into calendar
//! fields — the same one `ls`'s date column and the login clock read, never a
//! second copy of the day/minute arithmetic. Only the *spelling* is this
//! module's: `HH:mm` is the bar's own, and `CivilTime`'s rustdoc leaves
//! presentation to each consumer.
//!
//! # An unset clock says so, and is still a clock
//!
//! A machine whose wall time has never been established this boot reports
//! [`WallTimeState::Unset`](tairix_abi::time::WallTimeState::Unset) — the
//! Unix-epoch placeholder, which carries no real-world meaning. The label is
//! then the bar's own [`UNSET_LABEL`]: the shape of a time with no time in
//! it. `00:00` would be a fabricated reading, and an empty label would leave
//! the bar's clock — whose menu is where a time is
//! set — invisible at exactly the moment the user most needs to reach it.
//!
//! # One wake a minute, and none when nothing can be seen
//!
//! A clock is the one thing on the desktop that must change without anybody
//! touching anything, so it is the one thing that arms a deadline of its own.
//! It arms exactly one: the next minute boundary, folded into the session's
//! park through the same shared [`park_within`] every animated surface uses.
//! That is the fewest wakes a minute-granular clock can be right with — not a
//! poll, and nothing like the busy-wait the desktop forbids elsewhere. A
//! background session folds no deadlines at all, so its clock ticks not at
//! all: there is nothing on screen for it to be wrong on.
//!
//! The same deadline is also the *read* gate ([`SessionClock::is_due`]).
//! Plenty else wakes the session — a tray reading arrives every couple of
//! seconds — and reading the wall clock on each of those would put a syscall
//! on a path with nothing to ask about. The clock is read on the wakes it
//! shortened the park for, and on no others.
