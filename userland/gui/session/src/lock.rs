//! The desktop session's **screen lock**: the shared authentication surface
//! (`lib/greeter`) held over the whole display, taking every input event
//! until the signed-in user proves they are still the one at the keyboard.
//!
//! Locking is the one way out of a session that keeps the session. Everything
//! carries on running behind the lock — a build finishes, a download
//! completes, an editor keeps its unsaved buffer — but nothing on screen is
//! legible and no keystroke or click reaches any of it.
//!
//! # What makes it a lock rather than a window
//!
//! The surface asks for a password and concludes only on a verified one;
//! that much is `tairix_greeter`'s. What this module adds is everything that
//! makes asking *unavoidable*, and none of it can be done from inside a
//! surface:
//!
//! * **It covers the screen.** The window is the compositor's full extent
//!   and fully opaque, so no pixel of the session shows through. Someone
//!   walking past a locked machine learns nothing about what is on it.
//! * **It takes every event.** While locked, the embedder drains the pointer
//!   and keyboard into [`handle`](ScreenLock::handle) and routes *nothing*
//!   onward — not to the window manager, not to the taskbar, not to a served
//!   application. That is the embedder's contract, stated on
//!   [`is_locked`](ScreenLock::is_locked); a window cannot enforce it from
//!   the inside.
//! * **It stays on top.** [`keep_topmost`](ScreenLock::keep_topmost) raises
//!   it before every composite, beneath only the screensaver, so an
//!   application that opens or raises a window behind the lock cannot
//!   surface above it.
//!
//! # Who decides it may open again
//!
//! The lock holds no authority to authenticate anybody. The desktop's
//! [`Verifier`] is the per-console elevation broker — the login supervisor
//! that started this session — which attests the caller's identity from the
//! kernel, checks the password against *that* uid, and audits the decision.
//! It therefore ignores the account name the surface offers it: the only
//! identity it will ever check is this process's own. A refusal, a transport
//! failure, a broker that is not there, and a reply it cannot parse are all
//! the same answer: still locked.
