//! Painting the taskbar's regions into a pixel [`Surface`].
//!
//! [`TaskbarRenderer::paint`] lays the taskbar's computed [`BarLayout`] and
//! live state into the caller's premultiplied-alpha [`Surface`], over the
//! rectangles of it the caller names. The
//! two permanent leading launchers are the shared `lib/controls`
//! [`IconButton`](tairix_controls::IconButton)s the model owns, painted with
//! their live hover/pressed state; every running application is one shared
//! icon-only [`TaskbarItem`](tairix_controls::TaskbarItem) slot, so the bar's
//! application buttons have exactly one visual recipe and read as one strip
//! of equal icons. Per-application artwork (rasterised by the session) is
//! blitted through the control, drawn from the bundle the kernel attested
//! opened the window, so a running application is recognised by what it
//! actually is. The one mark the bar draws for itself is the [`BarLayout::separator`] rule dividing the Library launcher
//! from everything after it, filled in [`Palette::border`].
//! The bar's own background is the shared floating-surface plate
//! ([`paint_surface_plate`]) the popups it opens already wear: a rim one
//! [`plate_border`] thick in [`Palette::rim`] at the theme's chrome weight,
//! then the raised ground inside it, both rounded by
//! [`BarLayout::corner_radius`]. That is the same radius the window manager
//! cuts the bar window to through its single anti-aliased rounded-corner
//! path, exactly as it rounds windows, so the rim follows the bar's real
//! silhouette instead of squaring off across the cut. Placing the surface
//! stays the window manager's job.
//!
//! [`TaskbarRenderer::paint_library`] paints the open program-library popup:
//! the shared [`Panel`](tairix_controls::Panel) chrome anchored back at the
//! Library button, the search field, one shared list row per folder or
//! entry, the scrollbar when the rows overflow, and the calm placeholder when
//! nothing is listed. The theme is the taskbar's own
//! ([`Taskbar::theme`]), so the geometry the input router hit-tests and the
//! pixels painted here can never come from two different themes.
//!
//! [`TaskbarRenderer::paint_notifications`] paints the notification popover:
//! the shared `lib/controls` [`Panel`](tairix_controls::Panel) chrome anchored
//! back at the notification region, and one shared [`Notification`] card per
//! raised notification (severity mapped to the card's composed state),
//! presented by the window manager as its own small window above the bar.
//!
//! [`TaskbarRenderer::paint_tray_readout`] paints the account capsule's
//! expanded readout: the shared [`TraySignal`](tairix_controls::TraySignal)
//! draws its own elevated plate at the geometry
//! [`Taskbar::tray_readout_layout`] computed, presented by the window
//! manager as its own small window beside the capsule (the capsule itself is
//! painted on the bar by [`paint`](TaskbarRenderer::paint)).
//!
//! Every painter takes the surface's own rectangles to paint and lays the
//! whole recipe under each as a clip, so a repaint scoped to one hovered slot
//! lands exactly the pixels a whole paint would have laid there and there is
//! no second "paint just this control" recipe to disagree with the first.
//!
//! Region rectangles are in screen space; each is translated into the
//! surface's local space by subtracting the surface's origin. The translation
//! saturates and [`Surface::fill_rect`] clips, so a degenerate layout paints
//! nothing rather than panicking. A label is truncated to
//! the characters that fit its region so text never spills into a neighbour.
//! Each status-signal slot draws a scalable, themeable [`tairix_icon`] vector
//! glyph resolved from the signal's kind, rasterised to the slot size and
//! composited through `lib/raster`'s single blit path.
