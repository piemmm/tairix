//! Which of the taskbar's rendered surfaces need repainting, and what of each.
//!
//! The taskbar presents up to six independent pixel surfaces at once: the
//! bar strip, the program-library popup, the window picker, the notification
//! popover, the Switchboard capsule's expanded readout, and the volume panel.
//! A hover moving
//! within a small popup changes only that one surface's pixels — the others
//! are untouched. Latching a single flag for all of them (as the bar once
//! did) forces the embedder to re-render and re-composite every surface for
//! every such change, which is measurably wasteful: repainting the bar and
//! the library popup cost more than ten times what repainting a small popover
//! alone costs, so a single flag turns cheap, frequent hovers into the most
//! expensive path on the desktop. [`TaskbarRepaint`] carries one
//! [`Repaint`] account per surface so
//! [`Taskbar::take_repaint`](crate::Taskbar::take_repaint) tells the embedder
//! exactly which of them changed **and which of their pixels**.
//!
//! A whole-surface account is what a change to the model itself owes — a new
//! clock label, a rebuilt application strip, a theme swap — because such a
//! change has no rectangle smaller than the surface. A change a *control*
//! reports owes only that control's own rectangles, which is what keeps a
//! pointer crossing the bar costing the two slots it moved between rather
//! than the whole strip.
//!
//! [`Taskbar`](crate::Taskbar) latches this per-surface rather than as one
//! bit, and its per-site latches are attributed by construction: a state
//! change that touches only what one surface draws owes only that surface,
//! while a change that touches several (opening the library popup also
//! presses the bar's Library button; a theme swap repaints everything) owes
//! all of them, composed with [`BitOr`]/[`BitOrAssign`].
//!
//! A menu is not among them: every menu on the desktop is the seat's one
//! chain, drawn by the session (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md`), so the bar has no menu
//! pixels to latch — though it owes its plates the same per-rectangle account,
//! which is why [`Repaint`] is the shared one.
