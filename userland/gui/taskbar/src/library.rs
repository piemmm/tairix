//! The program-library popup: the folder-organised application launcher the
//! taskbar's Library button opens (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T5).
//!
//! [`LibraryPopup`] is a pure model over the **resolved** program-library
//! [`Catalog`] the session hands it — the machine store merged with the
//! user's overlay through `tairix_proglib::merge`. The popup never touches
//! the VFS and holds no authority: selecting an entry only *reports* a
//! launch outcome carrying the entry's identifier (surfaced as
//! [`TaskbarResponse::LibraryLaunch`](crate::TaskbarResponse::LibraryLaunch)),
//! and the session glue (which holds the spawn capability) resolves the
//! bundle and launches it through the ordinary signature-checked load gate.
//!
//! The surface is composed from the shared Reactive Alloy vocabulary
//! (`lib/controls`): a [`Panel`] anchored at the Library button, a
//! [`SearchField`] filter, one list row per folder or entry, and a
//! [`ScrollBar`] when the rows overflow the viewport. Folders are the closed
//! [`LibraryCategory`] taxonomy in its canonical presentation order; a folder
//! with no entries is never shown, and an empty library renders a calm
//! placeholder rather than an error.
//!
//! # Interaction model
//!
//! While open the popup is modal: the desktop routes every pointer, scroll,
//! and key event here. Two focus fields cycle with `Tab` — the search field
//! and the row list — and every action is reachable from the keyboard:
//!
//! * `Up`/`Down` move the row cursor (wrapping), `Home`/`End` jump,
//!   `PageUp`/`PageDown` move by a viewport.
//! * `Enter` (or space) activates the cursor row: a folder toggles its
//!   expansion, an entry launches.
//! * `Left` collapses the cursor folder (or climbs from an entry to its
//!   folder); `Right` expands a collapsed folder or steps into its first
//!   entry.
//! * Typing anywhere routes into the search field; `Enter` in the search
//!   launches the first match; `Escape` clears a non-empty search, and
//!   dismisses the popup once the search is empty.
//!
//! Everything fails closed: a press on no row changes nothing, a launch is
//! only ever reported for a row that exists, an offer whose row has gone is
//! abandoned rather than guessed at, and degenerate geometry (a screen too
//! small for even one row) renders chrome with an empty viewport rather than
//! panicking.
