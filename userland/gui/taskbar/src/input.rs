//! Routing device input into taskbar actions.
//!
//! The [`TaskbarInput`] router turns a stream of device-level
//! [`InputEvent`]s into actions against a [`Taskbar`]: a primary-button press
//! is hit-tested against the bar's computed [`BarLayout`](crate::BarLayout)
//! and drives the model — opening the program-library popup, or performing
//! a running application's default action.
//! A press on a status signal or on the clock is claimed
//! but inert (both are live readouts, not action targets), and a press on an
//! open notification popover dismisses the card it lands on.
//!
//! It is the taskbar counterpart of the window manager's input router, and it
//! consumes the **same** shared [`tairix_input`] event vocabulary, so the
//! desktop routes one event type to both. Like that
//! router it holds no pixels, tracks the pointer position from motion events,
//! applies presses at that position, and never panics: a press that misses
//! every region changes nothing.
//!
//! # The bar acts on the pointer only while it holds it
//!
//! The bar knows where its own regions are. It cannot know whether anything is
//! *drawn over* them: a window dragged across the bar leaves the clock at the
//! clock's coordinates, and a router that hit-tested that position alone would
//! light up, open popovers, and act under a window the user is working in.
//! Stacking belongs to the desktop's seat, so the seat resolves which surface
//! the pointer rests on and hands the pointer events to that one router —
//! this one receives an event only while the bar holds the pointer, and every
//! event it is handed is therefore its own to act on.
//!
//! [`set_pointer_focus`](TaskbarInput::set_pointer_focus) is the other half of
//! that contract: it is how the seat says the pointer has *left* the bar, which
//! is the only way the hover the bar is drawing can be dropped. It cannot be
//! inferred from a position, because the pointer usually has not moved — a
//! window was raised over the bar, or a drag took the pointer — and testing
//! that unchanged position would answer "still on the clock" and leave a
//! highlighted slot and an open hover popover stranded over someone else's
//! window.
//!
//! While the program-library popup is open the router treats it as modal and
//! consumes the whole event stream — presses, releases, scroll, and keys all
//! route into the popup ([`LibraryPopup`](crate::LibraryPopup)); a press on
//! the Library button toggles the popup shut, and a press outside the panel
//! dismisses it (the standard click-away behaviour) without also acting on
//! what it landed on — one click does one thing. The popup's key model gives
//! every action a keyboard path; the desktop routes key events here only
//! while the popup is open, so the focused window's keys are untouched
//! otherwise.
//!
//! A secondary press asks the desktop to open a menu
//! ([`TaskbarResponse::OpenMenu`]): on a running application's slot with the
//! popup closed — the menu that *application* declared, or nothing at all when
//! it declared none — on the Switchboard capsule, on the clock, or on a
//! program-library entry row inside the open popup. The bar draws no menu
//! pixel: the seat's one chain places, draws, grabs and answers it, so while a
//! menu is up no event reaches the bar at all
//! (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md`).
//!
//! Resting the pointer on a slot whose application owns more than one window
//! opens the [`WindowPicker`], which is a pointer surface and nothing else: it
//! takes no keyboard, a press on a cell chooses that window, a scroll or a
//! press on its grid's scrollbar moves the grid, and a press on its own plate
//! is claimed and does nothing.
//!
//! Both of the picker's edges are timed, and the *clock* resolves them rather
//! than the pointer: it opens once the pointer has rested on the slot for
//! [`PICKER_OPEN_DELAY_NS`], and closes [`PICKER_CLOSE_GRACE_NS`] after the
//! pointer comes to rest on neither the slot nor the panel. A pointer sweeping
//! across the bar therefore opens nothing, and a pointer travelling from the
//! slot to a cell — which must cross surface belonging to neither — does not
//! lose the panel on the way. Neither edge is polled or slept on: the embedder
//! folds
//! [`park_deadline_ns`](TaskbarInput::park_deadline_ns) into the wait it was
//! already going to make and calls [`tick`](TaskbarInput::tick) when it
//! expires.
//!
//! The Switchboard capsule at the trailing end has its own quiet
//! microinteractions: a primary press and quick release opens Switchboard's
//! running-task section, while a press held past [`LONG_PRESS_AFTER_NS`]
//! opens its Recovery section instead — resolved at whichever event the
//! router next handles once the threshold has elapsed (ordinarily a motion
//! sample taken while the press is still held, or the release itself when
//! none arrives sooner), never by polling or sleeping. A press that drags
//! off the capsule before release fires nothing (fail closed), and a long
//! press that already fired never also fires the quick-click response on
//! release. The open readout's "Open Switchboard" safe action reaches the
//! same task destination. Scrolling over the capsule or its readout cycles
//! the task list, and a middle press over the capsule switches back to the
//! previous task.
