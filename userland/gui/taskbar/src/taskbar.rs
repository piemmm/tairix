//! The taskbar itself: its placement configuration and live state.
//!
//! [`Taskbar`] ties the permanent leading launcher button (Library), the
//! [`LibraryPopup`], the [`TaskList`], the [`NotificationArea`],
//! and the [`SwitchboardTray`] capsule to a [`TaskbarConfig`] (which screen
//! edge, how thick, and the per-region extents) and the active [`Theme`]. It
//! produces a [`BarLayout`] on demand from the current state and answers
//! pointer hits for input routing.
//!
//! The bar owns a copy of the active theme so its layout, hit-testing, and
//! painting all read one definition — the radius a hit-test assumes and the
//! radius the painter draws can never disagree. It also carries a per-surface
//! [`TaskbarRepaint`] latch: a state change that alters only what one of the
//! bar's five rendered surfaces draws sets that surface's flag (and every
//! surface it genuinely touches — never fewer), and the embedder drains it
//! with [`take_repaint`](Taskbar::take_repaint) to re-present exactly the
//! surfaces that changed.
