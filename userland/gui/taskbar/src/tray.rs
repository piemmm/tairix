//! The Switchboard tray capsule at the taskbar's trailing end.
//!
//! [`SwitchboardTray`] is the model behind the always-right-most Switchboard
//! slot: one shared `lib/controls` [`TraySignal`] capsule showing the
//! desktop's live system posture at a glance. The session feeds it the
//! latest [`TraySummary`] the Switchboard service published
//! ([`set_summary`](SwitchboardTray::set_summary)) and its own count of
//! unresponsive applications
//! ([`set_unresponsive`](SwitchboardTray::set_unresponsive)); each change
//! rebuilds the capsule through the one pure derive (`derive_signal`), so
//! the mapping from facts to furniture is spelled exactly once.
//!
//! The derive picks one *dominant* state for the badge, label, and value —
//! in precedence order: hung applications, resource pressure, background
//! jobs, recovery candidates, then calm. The orthogonal furniture composes
//! regardless of which dominates: the working Heat Seam whenever jobs run,
//! the leading pressure rail whenever a pressure is named, and the recovery
//! posture (hung outranking recoverable) whenever either holds. The
//! hover readout previews the busiest task only in the *calm* state; in
//! every other state the value line keeps the dominant state's own figure —
//! the more urgent information — rather than the preview. With no summary at
//! all (the service absent or not yet published) the capsule derives calm
//! idle with no value: it never fabricates a reading it was not fed (fail
//! closed).
//!
//! The capsule wears the signed-in account rather than a system glyph: the
//! desktop's one system control point is the account it belongs to, and the
//! rows behind it (lock, switch user, log out, shut down) are that account's.
//! The picture is the account's circular identity disc
//! ([`identity_disc`](SwitchboardTray::identity_disc)) — the same mark the
//! login screen drew — so the mark a person signed in as is the mark they then
//! live with. An account has no picture of its own yet, so the disc is its
//! monogram; a name that yields no character still marks the disc, so there is
//! always a picture and it is always a circle.
//!
//! The readout always carries one safe action, "Open Switchboard": a click
//! that completes on it reports [`TraySignalAction::Activated`], which the
//! taskbar's input router (`crate::input`) turns into the response that
//! opens the Switchboard window. The router reaches the same destination
//! from the capsule itself: a primary press opens the running-task section,
//! and a press held past the long-press threshold opens Recovery instead —
//! the session asks the Switchboard service to open, or revive and open,
//! its window at that section.
