//! The desktop's system quick-actions vocabulary: the closed set of
//! commands the Switchboard capsule's context menu offers, and the one
//! ordered table that defines the menu's shape.
//!
//! [`ROWS`] is the single definition of what the menu is: each entry names
//! the command, its label, whether it opens a new visual group, and its
//! role. The rendered rows, the row → command mapping, and the tests all
//! read that table, so a row can never exist without a command behind it (or
//! the reverse).
//!
//! A command that destroys work in progress carries its confirmation
//! requirement in the *type* of the outcome it reports rather than in a
//! column here, so the session cannot apply it without asking first.
//!
//! Nothing here holds or checks authority. A row renders permitted only
//! because a process that *does* hold the authority attested to it, and a
//! row whose backing is absent renders non-actionable with a stated reason
//! rather than being offered and then failing. The one exception is a
//! command the machine does not *have* — fast user switching on a desktop
//! no session authority started — where there is no refusal to explain and
//! the row is left out entirely ([`SystemRow::offered_by`]).
