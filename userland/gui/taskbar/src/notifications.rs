//! The notification area: persistent status signals and transient
//! notifications, immediately before the clock and the reserved Switchboard
//! slot.
//!
//! The area holds two distinct things. The **status signals** are the
//! persistent tray glyphs (network, volume, battery); each names a
//! [`StatusKind`] the renderer draws as a calm glyph resolved from the loaded
//! `/System/Graphics` icon set. The **transient notifications** are the
//! short, severity-ranked messages a producer service raises and clears over
//! the notification IPC (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T8); the session relays each
//! into this model keyed to the producer's kernel-attested identity, and the
//! taskbar presents them as shared `lib/controls` notification cards.
//!
//! The model holds no authority and performs no I/O: the session owns the
//! live feed (status signals from the tray-signal feed; notifications from
//! the notification IPC) and hands it to the taskbar, exactly as it feeds the
//! application strip and the program library.
