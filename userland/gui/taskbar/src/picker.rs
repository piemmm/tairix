//! The window picker an icon-bar slot opens on hover.
//!
//! An icon-bar slot is one *application*, so a slot whose application owns
//! more than one window needs somewhere to choose between them. Resting the
//! pointer on the slot for [`PICKER_OPEN_DELAY_NS`] opens the picker: one
//! captioned thumbnail per window, and a primary press on a cell raises and
//! focuses that window.
//!
//! **It opens only above one window, and only on a deliberate rest.** A slot
//! with a single window has nothing to pick — a click on the slot already
//! reaches that window — and a pointer merely sweeping across a slot on its
//! way somewhere else has asked for nothing, so the dwell is what separates a
//! hover from a passing pointer. Leaving the slot does not close the picker
//! at once either: it survives [`PICKER_CLOSE_GRACE_NS`], which is what lets
//! the pointer cross the gap between the bar and the panel to make a choice.
//!
//! **Every window is reachable, however many there are.** The cells wrap into
//! a grid sized to the space beside the bar, and a grid that still does not
//! fit scrolls, so a cell is never laid out where it cannot be clicked.
//!
//! The thumbnails are the session's: it maps every application's frame region
//! already, so it scales the last presented frame down to the cell through the
//! shared rasteriser and hands the result over — one window per turn of its
//! serve loop while the dwell runs, so populating a picker never blocks the
//! desktop. The bar never touches an application's live pixels, and a window
//! whose thumbnail has not landed yet draws its application's glyph instead of
//! a hole.
