//! The service's outside world in one seam ([`ServiceHost`]) and the body
//! of its run loop ([`Service`]).
//!
//! One cycle is: sample the live system, derive the tray summary, record
//! the meter readings, prune and refresh the activity-grouping state,
//! rebuild the overview model, and publish the summary when it is worth
//! publishing. The panel is refreshed on every cycle and the summary is
//! published on every cycle — **whether or not a window is open**. The
//! window is an optional view onto a monitor that never stops monitoring;
//! closing it removes a view, never a duty.
//!
//! The loop *body* lives here rather than in the `Run` binary so it is
//! exercised on the host against the same fake `sysinfo` transport the
//! sampler already uses plus a recording [`ServiceHost`]. What is left in
//! the binary is wiring: learning its own identity, binding its mailboxes,
//! arming the one multiplexed wait, translating window events, and
//! painting.
