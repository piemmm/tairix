//! System sampling: gathers a compact [`Sample`] of the live system state
//! through the System Information API, tracking the prior-sample state a
//! delta computation needs.
//!
//! Every field degrades to its honest empty form on a query failure or a
//! refused capability — never a fabricated value. `sysinfo` refusals are
//! observed as the typed [`CallError::PermissionDenied`] returned by
//! `lib/procinfo`'s helpers; the optional global-process, memory-pressure
//! and hardware scopes are probed exactly once, at startup
//! ([`probe_scopes`]), since a process's capability set is fixed at spawn
//! and re-probing per sample would only spam the audited memory-pressure
//! query for an answer that can never change.
//!
//! # Absence is explainable
//!
//! A reading that is absent carries *why*: the resolved [`ScopeVerdicts`]
//! travel on every [`Sample`], and [`Sample::absence`] turns an absent
//! reading into [`Absence::NotPermitted`] (the capability gating it is
//! outside this process's ceiling, so the query was never issued) or
//! [`Absence::Unavailable`] (it was issued and the service could not
//! answer, or its cadence has not yet produced a first reading). "You may
//! not see this" and "this is broken" are different statements, and the
//! surface must be able to make the right one.
//!
//! # Cadence
//!
//! Seventeen queries per sample would be absurd for a service that samples
//! every [`SAMPLE_PERIOD_NS`], so each
//! reading is classified under exactly one [`Cadence`] tier and the tier
//! decides when it is issued. Which tier a reading belongs to is stated on
//! its [`Sample`] field; the tiers themselves are defined once, in
//! [`crate::schedule`].
//!
//! # Bounded accumulation
//!
//! Every paged reading walks its pages to completion under a per-reading
//! cap, so a service answering an implausibly long (or hostile) list can
//! make the sampler allocate only up to that cap and no further. Reaching
//! the cap ends the walk deterministically — the retained records are the
//! first `cap` in the service's own stable order, not an arbitrary subset —
//! and is not a failure: the walk answers
//! [`WalkStep::Stop`], which is the
//! shared walker's honest early end rather than an error to be caught back.
