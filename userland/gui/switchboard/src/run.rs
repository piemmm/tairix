//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the Switchboard monitor service,
//! installed at `/System/Services/switchboard.app/Run`
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T10/T11) — spawned by the desktop session as the
//! logged-in user (never PID 1), so the tray-overview authority
//! (`CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`/`CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL`) never has to grow the
//! session's own manifest.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the
//! Rust userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI. `tairix-rt`
//! provides `_start`, the panic handler, the `#[global_allocator]`,
//! `ipc_call`, `ipc_recv`, `port_bind`, the shared-memory and wait-set
//! syscalls, `clock_get`, `cap_query`, `signal`, `signal_intake`, and
//! `stderr`; `tairix-procinfo`'s `IpcTransport` (enabled through its own
//! `program` feature) is the production `tairix_procinfo::Transport` the
//! sampler queries through.
//!
//! # What this service does
//!
//! Everything with behaviour worth testing lives in the host-tested
//! `tairix_switchboard` library: the sampler, the tray-summary derivation,
//! the publish gate, the live overview model, and the panel's window
//! lifecycle. This binary is the wiring the host cannot run:
//!
//! * it learns its own kernel-attested identity (`self_origin`) and binds
//!   the session's per-instance command mailbox under it;
//! * it learns the desktop session's own identity from the reply to its
//!   first publish, and authenticates every later command against that
//!   attested identity rather than any claim on the wire;
//! * it parks in **one** `waitset_wait` per iteration covering its
//!   termination signal, that command mailbox, and — only while a window is
//!   open — the window's event mailbox, with a timeout equal to the time
//!   remaining until the next sample is due. It never polls and never
//!   sleeps in a loop;
//! * it creates, paints, resizes, and destroys the overview window, and
//!   translates the window channel's wire input into the shared desktop
//!   input vocabulary the composition consumes.
//!
//! The tray summary is sampled and published on every cycle whether or not
//! a window is open: the window is a view onto a monitor that never stops
//! monitoring.
//!
//! A refusal from the session (`NotFound` — no session bound the endpoint,
//! or it exited; `PermissionDenied` — the session refused this instance's
//! identity, e.g. after a session restart left it orphaned) is a **clean**
//! exit: the service has no purpose without a session to report to. Any
//! other publish failure is retried on the next cycle, up to a small
//! bounded count in a row, after which the service gives up rather than
//! retrying forever. Every abnormal exit states its reason on `stderr`
//! first, and every refused *optional* action is stated on `stderr` without
//! ending the program.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy,
//! and fmt still cover the file.
