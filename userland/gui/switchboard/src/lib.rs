//! TAIRiX Switchboard monitor service: the sampler/derive/publish/schedule
//! core behind the always-right-most Switchboard taskbar icon
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T10).
//!
//! # What this service is
//!
//! The Switchboard is its own dedicated, capability-sized process
//! (`userland/gui/switchboard`), separate from the desktop session, exactly
//! so the session's own manifest never has to grow the system-wide sysinfo
//! and process-control authority the tray overview needs. It samples the
//! live system through the System Information API (never a private
//! back-channel, never `/proc`/`/sys`) and publishes a compact
//! [`tairix_abi::switchboard_ipc::TraySummary`] to the desktop session over
//! the seat-scoped `SWITCHBOARD_ENDPOINT` the session binds. Publication is
//! event-driven on change, with a bounded keepalive fallback — never
//! polled on a fixed cadence for its own sake.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! * [`sample`] — [`sample::Sampler`], which reads the live system facts
//!   the System Information API exposes — the process list, CPU time and
//!   per-CPU load, memory pressure and totals, identity and uptime, load
//!   average, the mount table and its volume capacities, volume I/O
//!   health, the network interfaces and their live rates, seats, resource
//!   limits, and crash records — on a staged cadence, and turns them into
//!   a [`sample::Sample`]. Every reading degrades on its own to an honest
//!   absence on a query failure or a refused capability, and the sample
//!   records which of the two it was ([`sample::Absence`]) rather than
//!   ever fabricating a value.
//! * [`mod@derive`] — [`derive::derive_summary`], the pure function that turns
//!   a [`sample::Sample`] plus the running [`derive::Hysteresis`] state
//!   into the wire [`tairix_abi::switchboard_ipc::TraySummary`].
//! * [`publish`] — [`publish::Publisher`], the change-only/keepalive
//!   publish gate and consecutive-failure counter.
//! * [`machine`] — [`machine::machine_report`], the sample projected into
//!   the [`tairix_abi::switchboard_ipc::MachineReport`] the System Monitor
//!   screensaver draws, published each sample while one watches.
//! * [`schedule`] — the pure, drift-free next-sample-deadline computation,
//!   so the service's run loop issues exactly one wait per iteration with a
//!   timeout equal to "time until the next thing that must happen" —
//!   tickless, never a busy poll.
//! * [`command`] — [`command::authenticate_command`], which drops any
//!   command not attested to the desktop session's identity before it is
//!   ever decoded, let alone applied.
//! * [`model`] — [`model::build_model`], the pure function that turns a
//!   [`sample::Sample`], the rolling [`model::LiveMeters`] and
//!   [`model::DeviceMeters`] state and the session's
//!   [`tairix_abi::switchboard_ipc::SeatReport`] into the live overview
//!   panel's [`view::SwitchboardModel`], and [`model::apply_action`],
//!   which maps the panel's reported [`view::SwitchboardAction`]
//!   back onto the outbound [`model::Effect`]s it implies.
//! * [`panel`] — [`panel::Panel`], the overview window's lifecycle (open,
//!   raise, refresh, close), effect application, and the one task menu the
//!   desktop may owe it an answer for.
//! * [`task_menu`] — the rows a task's menu declares, and the command a
//!   chosen row names.
//! * [`view`] — [`view::Switchboard`], the overview window's own screen:
//!   the navigation rail and per-section lists assembled purely from the
//!   shared Reactive Alloy controls, turning a
//!   [`view::SwitchboardModel`] into pixels and a gesture into a typed
//!   [`view::SwitchboardAction`].
//! * [`service`] — [`service::ServiceHost`], the single seam through which
//!   everything outside this process is reached, and [`service::Service`],
//!   the run loop's body: sample, derive, record, refresh the panel, and
//!   publish — every cycle, whether or not a window is open.
//! * [`wait`] — the wait-set token vocabulary the run loop's single
//!   multiplexed park covers: its own termination signal, the session's
//!   command mailbox, and — only while a window is open — that window's
//!   event mailbox.
//!
//! # Honest-data rules
//!
//! Every field this crate produces is either a real measurement or an
//! explicit absence (`None`, a [`MeterValue::Unmeasured`](tairix_controls::MeterValue::Unmeasured)
//! meter, or a documented honest zero such as `jobs`); nothing here ever
//! synthesises a plausible-looking value to fill a gap. A denied or failed
//! query degrades the one field it backs, is noted once (never spammed) at
//! the layer that has a stream to write to, and the sampler keeps producing
//! every other field truthfully. A reading no interface serves — background
//! jobs, a service list, per-task network bytes — states its absence rather
//! than a guess (`plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` S6).
//!
//! # Layering & safety
//!
//! `no_std` (with `alloc`); this crate depends only on the audited
//! `tairix-abi` wire types and the shared `tairix-procinfo` System
//! Information API client helpers, and links no kernel or driver crate.
//! No `unsafe`, and no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths. The
//! freestanding `Run` binary (`src/run.rs`) is documented separately; this
//! library is the host-testable core it drives.
