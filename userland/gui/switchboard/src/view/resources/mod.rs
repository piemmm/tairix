//! The Resources section: one pane per resource *device*, instrument-led
//! (`plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` S4, `plans/switchboard/02`–`07`).
//!
//! A leading rail of the devices discovery found — grouped processor and
//! memory, then one entry per mounted volume, per managed interface, the
//! display path, and the machine's own fact panes — and the selected
//! device's pane beside it. The rail grows with the machine: twelve cores,
//! four volumes and three interfaces need no redesign and neither does the
//! fifth disk.
//!
//! # Selecting a device performs no I/O
//!
//! The rail's selection changes which pane is *drawn* from state the sampler
//! has already delivered. It issues no query, opens no store and waits on
//! nothing; a pane with no sample yet reads unavailable rather than blocking
//! for one.
//!
//! # The banner stands, the flow scrolls
//!
//! A pressure banner is pinned across the top of the pane, and the pane's
//! flow scrolls in what is left beneath it, so the pressure and its relief
//! stay in view however far the reader has scrolled. That one split is what
//! the paint, the scroll range and a refresh's report all read.
