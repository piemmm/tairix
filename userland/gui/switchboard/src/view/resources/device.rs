//! What the Resources section is about: one device per pane, and the rail
//! entry that reaches it (`plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` S4).
//!
//! A device is whatever discovery reports — a processor, the machine's RAM,
//! a storage device, a managed interface, the display path — plus the
//! `Machine` group's three fact panes. Nothing here is a class: the rail
//! grows with the machine, so twelve cores, four disks and three interfaces
//! need no redesign and neither does the fifth disk.
