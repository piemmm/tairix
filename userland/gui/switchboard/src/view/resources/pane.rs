//! The shared pane frame every Resources pane draws into
//! (`plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` S4).
//!
//! A pane is instrument-led: a hero carrying the device's headline reading
//! and the instrument that gives it shape, then blocks of the detail behind
//! it. A block holds whatever its reading *is* — a composition, a grid of
//! per-core cells, the tasks costing the device most, a status pill, or
//! genuine facts — so a resource's shape over time is never flattened into
//! key/value text.
//!
//! # One flow, resolved once
//!
//! Every pane compiles to a flat run of short, self-contained [`PaneItem`]s,
//! each holding the control it draws and knowing its own row and column
//! before any paint. Row spans are fixed and width-independent, so the
//! scroll range is exact, and the paint never lays out anything: it walks
//! the items the viewport covers and draws them. An item keeps its natural
//! size wherever the pane is scrolled to, so one the reader has scrolled
//! part-way past is cut by the viewport's edge rather than squeezed.
