//! The surface's one titled-block anatomy: a bordered, slightly-lighter
//! plate under a small-caps accent title with a hairline rule
//! (`plans/switchboard/02-cpu.png`, `01-tasks.png`, `08-recovery.png`).
//!
//! Resources and Recovery are built from blocks — a pane's hero and detail
//! blocks, a fault's detail and timeline blocks, and the action column each
//! section carries — and the boards draw all of them the same way. Defining
//! that once is what stops two sections reading as two products.
//!
//! Not a control: [`tairix_controls::Panel`] is a different anatomy (a header
//! band at control height, a dominant rail, a signal bead, an actions row) and
//! is shared with the terminal, the taskbar and the file manager, so retuning
//! it here would retune them. This is composition over the shared plate
//! primitives instead.
