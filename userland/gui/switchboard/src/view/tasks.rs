//! The Tasks section: the live task/application table
//! (`plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` S3, S4).
//!
//! Owns the caller's task view model ([`TaskSummary`]), the sortable
//! [`TableHeader`] and its [`TableRow`]s, the selected task's command
//! [`ActionRail`], the footer band (the shown/total count, the auto-refresh
//! [`Toggle`] and the grouping [`ComboBox`]), and the section's layout,
//! painting and input.
//!
//! # The commands act on the selection, not on a row
//!
//! The table states what each task *is*; the trailing rail states what may be
//! *done* to whichever task is selected. Keeping the commands out of the rows
//! is what lets the rail name a task's whole repertoire — switch to it, pause
//! it, lower it, end it — instead of the one or two buttons a row's trailing
//! cell could hold, and it keeps the anchored commands still while the rows
//! scroll beneath them.
//!
//! # Arrangement, not a second query
//!
//! Sorting and grouping are pure *arrangements* of the one set of rows the
//! sample produced: the section's own `arrange` step is the only place the
//! shown order is decided, and it re-derives that order from the adopted
//! [`TaskSummary`]s rather than asking the system for a different answer.
//! Nothing here reads a figure the service did not measure.
