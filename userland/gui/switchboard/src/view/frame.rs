//! The one section-frame anatomy every Switchboard section lays out into
//! (`plans/NEW-SWITCHBOARD.md` S3).
//!
//! Every section is the same shape:
//!
//! ```text
//!  sidebar? |            header?                                  |
//!           |  primary   |  detail?   |  impact?   |  rail?     |
//!           |            footer?                                  |
//! ```
//!
//! A section states what it wants, in logical (unscaled) lengths, as a
//! [`SectionAnatomy`]; [`resolve_section_frame`] is the *one* place that
//! request is turned into the physical [`SectionFrame`] rectangles every
//! section draws into and hit-tests against. No section restates this
//! geometry, and a content rect too narrow or too short to seat every region
//! resolves the same way everywhere rather than as a per-section
//! improvisation.
