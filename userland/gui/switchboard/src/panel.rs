//! The live overview panel's lifecycle: opening, raising, refreshing, and
//! closing the one window this service ever shows, and applying the
//! [`Effect`] each reported [`SwitchboardAction`] implies.
//!
//! The service is a monitor first and a window host second: it keeps
//! sampling and publishing its tray summary whether or not a window is
//! open, and a window is only ever opened because the session asked for one
//! ([`Panel::open_section`]). At most one window exists at a time — a second
//! request raises the one already open rather than stacking another.
//!
//! Everything that touches the outside world — the window channel, the
//! session's request endpoint, the `signal` syscall, and the diagnostic
//! stream — is reached through the one [`ServiceHost`] seam, so this whole
//! lifecycle is exercised on the host against a recording fake, exactly as
//! the sampler is exercised against a fake `sysinfo` transport.
