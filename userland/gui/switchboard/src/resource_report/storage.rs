//! One pane per storage *device*: how fast it is serving, what it holds,
//! what medium it is on, and every completion bucketed
//! (`plans/switchboard/04-disk.png`).
//!
//! The service readings are the device's, not a mount's: every volume on one
//! disk reads the same fold, and one volume is projected at as many mount
//! points as the namespace needs. So the rail groups the mount table into
//! devices before it draws anything — otherwise a disk's throughput is
//! reported once per partition and once per projection, and a volume's
//! counters are deltaed against themselves.
//!
//! Nothing here is served pre-derived: throughput, IOPS, utilisation, await
//! and mean queue depth are all deltas of the device's cumulative counters
//! over this sample's own interval, folded once in the rolling meters. A
//! first sample, an unmeasurable interval, and an interval in which nothing
//! completed each yield no reading rather than a nought that would read as an
//! idle device.
