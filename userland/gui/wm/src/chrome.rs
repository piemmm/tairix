//! Window chrome: the four furniture strips a decorated window is drawn
//! from, and the bounded, pressure-governed cache that retains them.
//!
//! # Strips, not one outer-sized surface
//!
//! A decorated window's whole [`WindowFrame`] does not fit in one
//! outer-window-sized [`Surface`] worth keeping: the client region of such a
//! surface is never sampled — the compositor draws the window's own content
//! there, never the decoration's — so for a large window almost all of it
//! would be allocated, cleared, and rendered for nothing that is ever read.
//!
//! [`WindowChrome`] holds only the four furniture strips the frame actually
//! draws into: the top (title) band, the bottom band, and the left and right
//! side borders. Retained memory scales with the reserved frame band (a fixed
//! size for a given theme/scale), never with the window's client area, so a
//! tall or wide window's decoration does not grow past what its border
//! thickness needs. Nothing outer-sized is allocated on the way there either:
//! each strip is a [`Surface`] the size of its own band that the frame paints
//! *into* as one rectangle of the whole window
//! ([`Surface::with_origin`](crate::surface::Surface::with_origin)), so a
//! window's furniture costs its bands rather than its area even transiently.
//!
//! The top and bottom strips are as deep as the rim's corner radius wherever
//! the reserved inset is thinner than it, because a corner arc must be drawn as
//! furniture over the whole width of its rows or the client's square row would
//! be the only pixels there. The window decides those depths; the strips here
//! are simply cut to the rectangles it gives.
//!
//! # Retained by the compositor, not by the window
//!
//! The strips are *derived* pixels: losing them costs a re-render and never
//! a wrong result. They are therefore held in a [`ReclaimCache`]
//! (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` section 6.4) that the compositor owns and every
//! window shares, rather than in each window, so the desktop's total
//! furniture is bounded, charged to the seat, wiped on release, and given
//! back the moment the machine reports memory pressure. [`chrome_cache`] is
//! the one place this crate assembles that cache; the compositor is handed
//! the result and never builds its own policy, because a cache built
//! without a live gauge would classify and serve every lookup correctly
//! while retaining nothing — a defect that looks exactly like working
//! software.
//!
//! Furniture carries the window's title, which is user data, so the cache's
//! declared sensitivity makes [`CachedBytes::wipe`] a real obligation:
//! every released strip is overwritten before its heap becomes reusable.
