//! The frosted backdrop of a backdrop-blurred window, and the bounded,
//! pressure-governed cache that retains it between frames.
//!
//! # Why it is retained
//!
//! A frosted window's pixels are blended over a blur of *everything beneath
//! its rectangle*, so the compositor composes the layers below it, blurs that
//! rectangle of the back buffer, and resumes from the window itself. The blur
//! is two separable passes over the whole rectangle whatever the frame
//! actually changed, which made the dominant interaction — the pointer moving
//! inside a frosted terminal — cost a full-window frost per sample: measured
//! at 17.4 ms for a 64×24 repaint, against 0.9 µs for the same repaint over an
//! opaque stack.
//!
//! Nothing about that blur changes when the window's own content changes.
//! Retaining it turns the dominant case into a row copy.
//!
//! # What makes a retained one invalid
//!
//! A frost is a function of exactly four things: the composed pixels beneath
//! it, the window's own rectangle, the physical blur radius, and the window
//! shape the mix is weighted by. The last three are recorded in the entry and
//! compared on every lookup, so a geometry, radius, scale, or corner change
//! fails closed to a recompute even if the compositor forgot to say so.
//!
//! The rectangle recorded is the window's *whole* one, not the part of it that
//! is on screen. A window pushed off an edge is frosted from the row and
//! column the screen begins at while its shape is still read from its own
//! top-left, so two positions that clip to the same on-screen rectangle can
//! weight the same pixels by different parts of the shape.
//!
//! The first cannot be self-checked without reading the pixels it would have
//! saved, so the compositor drops the entry when it marks damage that changes
//! them: damage below the window, or a change to the window's own stacking.
//! Damage from the window's own content, or from anything stacked above it,
//! changes nothing it reads.
//!
//! # Why a moved window keeps most of it
//!
//! Moving a window does not disturb the layers beneath it, so a frost taken
//! before the move is still exactly right — in *screen* coordinates — wherever
//! neither difference between the two positions can reach: the blur replicates
//! at its rectangle's edges, and the shape weights the mix by a window-local
//! coordinate. Both differences are confined to a border, so the pixels
//! `FrostedBackdrop::reuse` hands back as a core are bit-for-bit what
//! a fresh blur would write and only the border has to be blurred again
//! (`Surface::frost_region_around`). Without that, every sample of a drag paid
//! a full-window blur *and* a full-window composite of the layers under it, for
//! a picture that had moved a few pixels.
//!
//! A move does not resize, so the retaken frost also goes straight back into
//! the pixels already retained (`FrostedBackdrop::recapture`): a sample costs
//! the row copy alone, rather than freeing a screen-scale buffer and asking for
//! an identical one as well.
