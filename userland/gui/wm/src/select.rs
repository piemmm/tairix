//! Choosing the pointer cursor from live interaction state.
//!
//! The cursor *artwork* (a scalable, colourful, replaceable vector cursor)
//! and its placement both live in `lib/cursor`; the compositor only blits
//! the rasterised image. This module is the missing middle: it decides
//! **which** [`CursorKind`] the desktop should show given what the user is
//! doing, then turns that choice into pixels and hands them to the
//! compositor.
//!
//! # The policy
//!
//! [`desired_cursor`] reads the pointer position the desktop's seat owns plus
//! the interaction state held by the [`InputRouter`] and the [`Compositor`],
//! and returns a [`CursorKind`]:
//!
//! - an in-flight grab outranks everything: a window move-grab shows
//!   [`CursorKind::Move`] and a resize-grab keeps the double arrow of the edge
//!   it is dragging, even once the pointer has run past that edge;
//! - otherwise, over a decorated window's resize edge the pointer takes the
//!   double arrow of the axis that edge moves along, so a grabbable edge
//!   announces itself before it is pressed;
//! - otherwise the pointer takes the [`cursor_hint`](crate::Window::cursor_hint)
//!   of the top-most window under it (a text editor's
//!   [`Text`](CursorKind::Text), a control's [`Pointer`](CursorKind::Pointer),
//!   a busy view's [`Busy`](CursorKind::Busy), …);
//! - over the desktop background it is the plain [`CursorKind::Arrow`].
//!
//! The policy is a pure function of state, so it is trivially testable and
//! has no hidden authority.
//!
//! # Applying the choice
//!
//! [`CursorController`] ties the policy to the artwork. It owns the active
//! [`CursorRegistry`] and remembers which [`CursorKind`] is on screen and at
//! what density it was rasterised. It does **not** own the scale: the desktop
//! density belongs to the output, so the controller reads it from the
//! [`Compositor`] ([`Compositor::scale`]) every time it installs a cursor.
//! It *does* own the pointer's **logical** side, which is the user's
//! accessibility choice rather than the output's property, and resolves the
//! two into physical pixels through the one shared conversion.
//! [`CursorController::refresh`] runs the policy and
//! re-rasterises only when something the cursor depends on actually changed —
//! the chosen kind, the active cursor set, or the pixel side the scale and
//! the logical side resolve to — installing
//! the result through [`Compositor::set_cursor`]. A runtime DPI change is
//! therefore [`Compositor::set_scale`] followed by one `refresh`, and a
//! pointer-size change is [`CursorController::set_logical_side`]. Pointer
//! *motion* is not its job — the caller moves the existing overlay with
//! [`Compositor::move_cursor`]; the controller switches the *shape*.
//!
//! Rasterisation can fail (a degenerate cursor or scale yields no image). The controller fails closed: it leaves the current
//! cursor in place and reports that nothing changed rather than blanking the
//! pointer or panicking.
//!
//! # The cache
//!
//! Each shown [`CursorKind`] is rasterised at most once per pixel side and
//! cursor set through a [`ReclaimCache`] (`plans/SMARTRAM.md` section 6.4): a
//! bounded, pressure-governed cache shared with every other reclaimable
//! cache in TAIRiX, rather than an unbounded cache of the controller's own.
//! [`CursorController`] never builds its own cache policy — that would be
//! the controller inventing its own memory budget — it is handed a
//! ready-built [`ReclaimCache`] as a required argument to
//! [`new`](CursorController::new) / [`with_registry`](CursorController::with_registry),
//! exactly as the kernel hands a `ClusterCache` to the ARXFS driver.
//! [`cursor_cache`] is the one place this crate assembles that cache from the
//! shared desktop cache policy, so the caller supplies only the real output
//! size, the owning seat, and the process's live pressure gauge and audit
//! sink — never a parameterless fallback. A cache built without a live gauge
//! would classify and serve every lookup correctly while retaining nothing,
//! which is a defect that looks exactly like working software; requiring the
//! real inputs up front is what rules that out.
