//! Input routing: focus, click-to-activate, and interactive move-grabs.
//!
//! The [`InputRouter`] turns a stream of device-level pointer
//! [`InputEvent`]s into window-manager actions against a
//! [`Compositor`]: it tracks the pointer position and the focused
//! window, raises and focuses the window under a primary-button press
//! (*click-to-activate*), and drives an interactive *move-grab* so a
//! window can be dragged across the screen.
//!
//! The router holds no pixels and performs no compositing; it is the
//! policy layer that sits on top of the compositor's scene graph. A
//! move-grab is started explicitly through [`InputRouter::begin_move`]
//! rather than armed on every press, so a press that lands on a
//! window's *content* (reported back to the client through
//! [`InputResponse::Activated`]) never moves the window — only a grab
//! the desktop decorations choose to start, typically when the press
//! landed on a title bar, does. This keeps content interaction and
//! window dragging cleanly separated (no "drag
//! anywhere" hack).
//!
//! Keyboard input is delivered to the focused window: the router owns
//! *which* window has the keyboard ([`InputRouter::focused`]) and routes a
//! [`InputEvent::KeyPressed`] / [`InputEvent::KeyReleased`] to it as an
//! [`InputResponse::Key`], leaving the bytes-on-the-wire encoding to
//! `tairix_abi`'s `KeyInput`. A key with no focused window (focus on the
//! desktop, or the focused window since gone) is never misdelivered to some
//! other window: it is reported as an [`InputResponse::DesktopKey`] for the
//! desktop layer's owner to interpret.
//!
//! # The pointer is delivered, not assumed
//!
//! The router acts on the pointer only while it *holds* it. The desktop's seat
//! owns the window stack and resolves, per event, which surface the pointer
//! rests on — the window manager's windows and the desktop layer behind them,
//! or the desktop's own chrome (its bar and the popovers that bar opens) — and
//! delivers the event to that one router. [`set_pointer_focus`] is how the
//! seat says so: an [`Entered`] carries the position the pointer arrived at,
//! and a [`Left`] is what makes the hover this router is drawing go away —
//! a title bar's command control unlights when the pointer crosses onto the
//! bar, exactly as it unlights when the pointer crosses onto another window.
//!
//! A hover cannot be ended by inferring it from a position, because the
//! position often does not change: a window raised over a hovered title bar
//! leaves the pointer exactly where it was. Only the seat knows, so only the
//! seat can say.
//!
//! An in-flight grab holds the pointer for its whole gesture, so a drag that
//! runs off the window — or under the bar — keeps arriving here; that is the
//! seat's rule, and it is why this router never has to re-derive who owns a
//! drag.
//!
//! [`set_pointer_focus`]: InputRouter::set_pointer_focus
//! [`Entered`]: tairix_input::PointerFocus::Entered
//! [`Left`]: tairix_input::PointerFocus::Left
//!
//! Input that lands on nothing is likewise reported rather than swallowed.
//! The desktop beneath the window stack is a real surface with a real owner
//! ([`Compositor::set_desktop`](crate::Compositor::set_desktop)), so a
//! primary press, a secondary press, and a motion that resolve to no window
//! come back as [`DesktopPressed`], [`DesktopSecondaryPressed`], and
//! [`DesktopPointerMoved`]. The router still takes no action of its own for
//! them — it only names where they landed.
//!
//! [`DesktopPressed`]: InputResponse::DesktopPressed
//! [`DesktopSecondaryPressed`]: InputResponse::DesktopSecondaryPressed
