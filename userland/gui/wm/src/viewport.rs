//! Root-viewport scrollbars: the window-manager furniture that exposes a
//! window's scroll position through the one shared scroll geometry engine.
//!
//! A top-level window may declare a **root viewport** — window-level
//! scrollbars the window manager composes and owns, rather than application
//! controls the client draws inside its own content. The design language
//! requires both the window-level bars here and any nested application bars to
//! use the same range validation, thumb math, and input behaviour, over one
//! implementation rather than separate recipes; this module is the
//! window-manager consumer of that shared engine ([`tairix_controls::scroll`]),
//! and the viewer app is the independent nested consumer.
//!
//! A [`RootViewport`] carries a [`ScrollModel`] per axis (either may be
//! absent), a visibility [`ScrollPolicy`], and the theme-derived scrollbar
//! breadth and minimum thumb length in **physical** pixels. From a window's
//! screen [`Rect`] it derives a [`FurnitureLayout`] — the client rectangle and
//! the track/corner rectangles — and classifies a screen point into a
//! [`FurnitureHit`]. Because the layout reserves a stable gutter under
//! [`ScrollPolicy::ReservedGutter`], the client can never receive a pointer
//! event that lands on the furniture, and the furniture never overlaps the
//! client (the separate furniture hit map the design language mandates).
//!
//! Everything here is pure integer geometry over the shared engine: no
//! rendering, no allocation, and no panic — an axis with no bar, a
//! zero-size window, or a degenerate track simply yields no furniture and no
//! movement (fail closed).
