//! Per-window rounded-corner selection.
//!
//! A window (and the taskbar, through this same path) may request rounded
//! corners of a given radius. Composition multiplies each source pixel's
//! alpha by a *coverage* value in `0..=255`: `255` deep inside the rounded
//! rectangle, `0` outside it, and a smooth ramp across the corner arc.
//!
//! The coverage arithmetic itself is **not** defined here: it is the shared
//! `tairix_raster::round_rect_coverage`, the single rounded-rectangle
//! definition the compositor and the Reactive Alloy control plates both round
//! through, so window corners and control corners can never diverge. This type
//! only carries the per-window corner *choice*.
