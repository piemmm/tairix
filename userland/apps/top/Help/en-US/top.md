## NAME

top — watch the process list live

## SYNOPSIS

`top [-d secs.tenths] [-h | -?]`

## DESCRIPTION

Shows a live, full-screen view of the process list through the System
Information API, in the spirit of GNU `top`. It starts on the
caller's own processes; the system-wide view is granted by the service
only to a caller holding `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`.

The display refreshes itself every delay interval (3.0 seconds unless
`-d` changes it), and `r` refreshes it immediately. A refresh the system
information service could not finish under load keeps the last listing,
the status line saying so, and the next refresh reads the list again.

The viewer takes no operands: it is controlled with keys pressed inside
the session.

- `q` — quit.
- `a` — toggle between your own processes and the system-wide view.
  If the service refuses the system-wide view (it requires
  `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL`), the viewer stays on your own processes and the
  status line says why; the session keeps running.
- `r` — refresh the listing.
- Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End — move the selection.
- `h`, `?` — toggle the in-session key overlay.

Four summary lines precede the list: the uptime, logged-in-user count,
and 1/5/15-minute load averages; the task census by state; the
`%Cpu(s)` utilisation split; and the memory figures in MiB. The memory
line needs `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` — a caller without it sees the refusal
spelled out and the session continues.

The `%Cpu(s)` line shows the share of the last interval every CPU
together spent busy (running tasks) and idle. TAIRiX accounts busy and
idle time only, so where GNU `top` breaks the busy share into
user/system/nice/iowait figures this line deliberately shows the two
real figures instead.

The rows are sorted by `%CPU`, biggest consumer first, and carry:

- `PID` — the numeric process id.
- `USER` — the owning account's username, resolved from the system's
  account directory; the numeric uid stands in when the name cannot be
  resolved.
- `SIZE` — the memory mapped in the process's address space (image,
  stack, and heap alike), in binary units: the exact count below a
  kibibyte, then one decimal place with a `K`, `M`, `G`, `T`, `P` or `E`
  suffix (`4.0K`, `986.2M`, `2.0G`). The ladder reaches exbibytes, so the
  figure always fits its column.
- `S` — the state letter: `R` running (green), `r` runnable, waiting
  for a CPU (cyan), `S` sleeping, `T` stopped (yellow), `Z` zombie
  (magenta). Colours appear on a colour terminal only; the letter
  itself always carries the state.
- `%CPU` — the CPU share over the interval since the previous refresh.
- `WCPU` — the weighted (exponentially smoothed) CPU share across
  refreshes, steadier than the instantaneous column.
- `TIME+` — cumulative CPU time, as `minutes:seconds.hundredths`.
- `COMMAND` — the process name.

## OPTIONS

- `-d, --delay <seconds>` — the interval between automatic refreshes,
  in seconds with an optional fraction (only the first fractional
  digit, tenths, is kept): `top -d 1.5` refreshes every 1.5 seconds.
  Defaults to 3.0. GNU `top` accepts a zero delay and refreshes as fast
  as it can; TAIRiX never busy-loops, so a zero is clamped to the 0.1 s
  minimum.
- `-h, -?` — show this command's own short help and exit. Inside a
  running session the same keys toggle the key overlay instead.

## EXIT STATUS

- `0` — the session ended with `q`, or the short help was shown.
- `1` — the service or the terminal failed; the reason is printed on
  standard error.
- `2` — the command line was not understood.

## ENVIRONMENT

- `LANG` — the preferred locale for the short help (a BCP-47 tag such
  as `fr-FR`).

- `man`
- `ps`
- `sysinfo`
