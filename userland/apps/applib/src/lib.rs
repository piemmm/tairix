//! TAIRiX `applib` — administer the desktop's program-library catalog
//! (`plans/NEW-TASKBAR.md` T2/T3).
//!
//! The library-admin command: `applib` lists the resolved library exactly as
//! the desktop's launcher shows it (machine store ∪ the caller's overlay);
//! `applib add`/`remove` register and unregister an application bundle;
//! `applib hide`/`show` set an entry's visibility verdict; `applib rescan`
//! walks the application stores and registers every listed bundle the
//! catalog does not know yet — discovery, never a compiled-in list. The
//! machine-wide store lives at `tairix_proglib::LIBRARY_PATH` and the
//! per-user overlay in this application's own *published* app-data scope
//! (`store::AppDataStore`, `plans/APPDATA.md` §1.1) — two backings of one
//! [`Store`] seam, so this tool's editing logic never learns where a catalog
//! lives. Every document is read and written through the one `lib/proglib`
//! registry, so this writer and the desktop's readers can never diverge.
//!
//! # What this crate is
//!
//! The pure, host-testable core of the tool: the [`parse`]r that maps a
//! command line to a [`Command`], and the [`run`] engine that executes it
//! against injected seams:
//!
//! * [`Store`] — read and replace one catalog document (the `Run` binary
//!   wires the syscall-backed machine store and, when the environment names
//!   a home, the caller's own overlay; tests wire in-memory fixtures).
//! * [`tairix_appstore::StoreReader`] — list a directory and read a bundle's
//!   `AppInfo` manifest, bounded by [`tairix_abi::APPINFO_WIRE_MAX`] (the `Run`
//!   binary wires the secured VFS; tests wire an in-memory tree). The store
//!   walk `rescan` drives is the shared one, so this tool, the file manager's
//!   open-with table, and the desktop's icon-bar index find the same bundles.
//! * [`Output`] — write listings to standard output and emit the fd-3
//!   `stdinfo` advisory records (best-effort, never load-bearing).
//! * `HelpSource` (from `lib/help`) — the tool's own bundle `Help/` tree,
//!   rendered by the `-h`/`-?` switches through the one shared engine.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! An unknown option, folder, or entry is a refusal that changes nothing; a
//! store document the shared engine cannot fully parse refuses the whole
//! operation rather than guessing at a merge; a refused read or write
//! surfaces the underlying [`Errno`] and states which store it concerns. A
//! `rescan` skips a bundle whose manifest is unreadable, over-long, or
//! undecodable — one bad bundle never aborts the scan — and fails closed on
//! a store tree larger than the walk bounds rather than reporting a partial
//! truth. Registering, hiding, or showing an entry changes *presentation
//! only*: launching a bundle stays behind the loader's signature and
//! capability gate regardless of what the catalog says.
//!
//! # Layering & safety
//!
//! `no_std` (with `alloc`); the only dependencies are the audited `lib/abi`
//! crate, the shared `lib/help` engine, and the shared `lib/proglib`
//! engine, so this userland tool never links a kernel or driver crate. No
//! `unsafe`, and no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths.
