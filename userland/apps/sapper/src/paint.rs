//! Drawing the board.
//!
//! Everything is composed from the shared raster primitives against the active
//! theme, so the game re-themes and re-densifies with the rest of the desktop
//! and owns no second rounded-rect, gradient, or text path. The one thing it
//! *does* own is its number palette: the eight adjacency colours are the game's
//! own visual identity, tuned per appearance, exactly as the terminal owns its
//! ANSI scheme rather than asking the desktop theme for sixteen colours it has
//! no opinion about.
//!
//! A frame resolves the theme into a [`Skin`] once and then draws cells from
//! it, so the per-cell path performs no palette lookups and no allocation.
//!
//! Motion is applied here rather than baked into the board: a covered cell
//! being revealed draws its finished face with the *lid* still over it, sliding
//! and fading off. That is why a suppressed animation needs no second code
//! path — with no motion the lid is simply already gone.
