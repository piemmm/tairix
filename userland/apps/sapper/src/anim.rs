//! The animation model: what each cell is doing right now, and when the next
//! frame is due.
//!
//! A board action hands its [`Move`](crate::board::Move) here as a **wave** —
//! the cells it changed, each starting a ring's worth of time after the one
//! before, so a cascade ripples outward from the click and a detonation chains
//! outward from the struck mine. The painter asks [`Motion::cell`] what a cell
//! is doing; nothing here draws.
//!
//! # It is never a loop, and it never runs when nothing changed
//!
//! Every wave is finite and begins at a state change. [`Motion::deadline_ns`]
//! answers `None` the moment the last one ends, and the event loop then parks
//! with no deadline at all — so an idle game costs no wake, no timer, and no
//! CPU. There is no decorative idle animation anywhere in this app.
//!
//! Reduced motion is honoured by not starting a wave at all: the board state is
//! applied before the wave is offered, so a suppressed wave means every cell
//! draws its finished appearance immediately. There is no second code path.
