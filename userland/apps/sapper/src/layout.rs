//! Where everything is drawn, in physical pixels.
//!
//! Every length is authored in *logical* pixels at the desktop's reference
//! density and converted through the one shared scale, so a dense display gets
//! a bigger board rather than a smaller one, and nothing here does the
//! conversion twice.
//!
//! The window is one header band — mine counter, new-game button, clock — over
//! a grid of square cells, centred in whatever is left. The cell side is
//! derived from the space available rather than fixed, so a resized window
//! shows the same board larger, between the legibility floor and the ceiling
//! the cell stops growing at. [`WindowGeometry`] is what the application asks
//! the window manager for: the size it opens at and the range both of those
//! bounds describe, as one value.
//!
//! Pure integer arithmetic with no division by a value that can be zero: a
//! board always has at least one column and one row, and a cell side is clamped
//! to at least one pixel.
