//! The board: the rules of the game, and the ordered wave every action
//! produces for the animation to be timed from.
//!
//! Nothing here draws, reads a clock, or performs I/O, so every rule below is a
//! host test. An action returns a [`Move`]: the cells whose drawn state
//! changed, each tagged with the breadth-first *ring* it was reached on, and
//! what the action concluded. The ring is what turns a flood fill into a
//! cascade rippling outward from the click rather than a region that blinks
//! into existence, and the same list is the damage set the repaint is scoped
//! to — one answer, not two.
//!
//! # Mines are laid on the first click, never before
//!
//! A board starts empty and lays its mines when the first cell is revealed,
//! excluding that cell **and its eight neighbours**. The opening move therefore
//! always opens a region rather than a bare number, and can never lose.
//!
//! Boards are otherwise uniformly random: proving one solvable without a guess
//! would need a solver in the generator, which is a deliberate non-goal.
