//! The `sapper.app` bundle's `Run` entry point: the windowed mine-clearing
//! game.
//!
//! Everything with behaviour lives in the host-tested model (`tairix_sapper`);
//! this binary composes it over the live window channel, exactly as the widget
//! gallery composes its own:
//!
//! * one `shm_create`d frame region granted to the reserved window endpoint;
//! * one `port_bind`-bound event mailbox the app **parks** on, accepting only
//!   events whose kernel-attested sender is the session the create reply named;
//! * a park that carries the game's own one-shot deadline — the next animation
//!   frame, or the clock's next whole second — and *no* deadline at all when
//!   the game owes neither, so an idle board costs no wake;
//! * a worker the best-times write is handed to, because that write is an IPC
//!   round trip to the settings service and this loop owes the window a frame.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
