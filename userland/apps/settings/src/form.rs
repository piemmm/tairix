//! The settings registry as form rows, and the one column of plates every
//! composed pane draws.
//!
//! One definition of each settable, and the panes that each select a subset
//! of it: Appearance offers light/dark and the interface axes, Accessibility
//! groups the same rows the way a reader looking for them would, and
//! Wallpaper the pinboard's own four. A reader looks for contrast in either
//! of the first two, so neither pane may carry its own copy of what contrast
//! *is* — the label, the sentence beneath it, the choices it offers, and the
//! key it writes all live here once.
//!
//! The settables span **three** stores, and a composition names which of
//! them its rows write: the desktop's own document, which the session owns
//! and adopts a change to at once; the machine's `system.conf`; and the
//! network store, both of which `configure` owns and a staged change is
//! applied to by re-running it as an account that may. One plate column
//! serves all three — a second would be more places to get focus,
//! scrolling and hit-testing right (`crate::machine` and `crate::network`
//! hold those two stores' settables themselves).
//!
//! A composition's groups are usually declared here, in a static table. A
//! networking one's are **discovered** instead, from a document only an
//! authenticated run can answer, so its rows name an interface by its
//! index in that document rather than by a name a static table could
//! carry.
//!
//! A composition also names the **group of keys** its rows write, because
//! the session merges an apply over what the desktop holds: a pane that
//! posted the whole document would reimpose whatever the *other* panes
//! happened to hold when it opened.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O or holds authority. A row reports the choice the
//! reader made; the pane renders the document that choice implies and the
//! session decides whether to adopt it.
