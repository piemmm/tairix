//! The read-only fact columns: what this machine *is*, and what its clock
//! says.
//!
//! Neither pane has a settable in it. About states the machine's identity,
//! its version, how long it has been running, and its processors and
//! memory; Date & Time states the wall clock and where the reading came
//! from, and offers the one command that changes it — which is not a
//! setting at all but a re-authenticated run of the application that owns
//! the clock. The networking readings are [`crate::network`]'s, because
//! the panes that state them stage a change to the store behind them.
//!
//! Byte counts read in the desktop's own prose ladder — the one the Storage
//! pane's capacities use — rather than the `df` spelling, because a machine's
//! memory is prose here and a column of figures there.
//!
//! Every figure is a measurement the caller took through the System
//! Information API. A reading that did not arrive renders unmeasured; none
//! is derived here, and none is remembered from a previous look.
