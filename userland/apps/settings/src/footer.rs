//! The pane's action band: what a pane offers beneath its column, and what
//! the last attempt came to.
//!
//! An immediate pane has none — its effect is its feedback, and a stale
//! Apply button is a trap. Every other pane has one of exactly two bands: a
//! staged pane's Revert and Apply over its working copy, and the single
//! named command a pane offers when it has no working copy at all — the
//! application that owns its subject, or the authenticated reading its rows
//! cannot exist without. A band offers Revert only where there is something
//! to revert.
