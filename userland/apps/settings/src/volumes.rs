//! The Storage pane: one card per mounted volume, read-only.
//!
//! Unlike every other composed pane, this one has no fixed table of
//! settables behind it — its cards are the volumes the machine turns out to
//! have, so they are built from the mount table at runtime and there is
//! nothing to write. Mounting and unmounting are the file manager's and
//! `mount`'s; a second route to them here would be two ways to do one thing.
//!
//! Every figure is derived by the one shared volume view model
//! (`tairix_procinfo::volume`), which the Switchboard's storage page and
//! `df` read too, so a volume cannot be half full on one surface and nearly
//! full on another. Nothing is derived here.
//!
//! A volume whose format tracks no capacity gets no track and no invented
//! percentage: its card says so in the row where the reading would have
//! been.
