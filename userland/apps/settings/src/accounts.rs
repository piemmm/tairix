//! The Users & Groups pane's three readings, and the one elevated run a
//! staged account change becomes.
//!
//! The fourth store this surface edits, and the only one read at three
//! different authorities at once. A principal may read *its own* record and
//! the public uid/gid-to-name directories without holding anything; every
//! other account's fields, its lock state and its capability ceiling are
//! `CAP_USER_ADMIN`'s, so they arrive only as the relayed output of a
//! `users` run an administrator authorised — the same elevated-read seam the

//!
//! The plates are therefore *discovered* from that listing rather than
//! declared in a table here, exactly as an interface's are: which accounts
//! exist is what the run answers, and the pane is built before anyone has
//! asked. How many there can be is bounded by the seam rather than by this
//! surface: a reply larger than the supervisor carries answers `Overran`,
//! so the pane either holds a listing small enough to draw or says plainly
//! that it holds none.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O or holds authority. A row reports the value the
//! reader typed or chose; the shell turns the difference into the one
//! elevated command that writes it, and the kernel decides whether the
