//! The desktop **Settings** application's host-tested model
//! (`plans/NEW-DESKTOP-SETTINGS.md`).
//!
//! This is the composition the `settings.app` bundle's `Run` binary drives.
//! It configures nothing itself: it holds no capability beyond the console
//! and its own window frame, and every change a pane will make is a request
//! to the process that already owns that domain. The whole surface is
//! generated from one closed registry table ([`CATEGORIES`]), so a
//! category cannot exist without a row and a row cannot exist without a pane.
//!
//! Every pixel is a shared [`tairix_controls`] control; this crate adds no
//! control implementation and no second theming or rasterisation path. What it
//! adds is the navigation — the strip, the search, the location trail, the
//! frame that sheds what a narrow window cannot seat — and the one renderer
//! for a pane that states how the machine actually stands rather than drawing
//! a control that would change nothing.
