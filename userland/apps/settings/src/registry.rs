//! The pane registry: the closed [`Category`] and [`Pane`] sets, and the one
//! ordered [`CATEGORIES`] table that defines the whole surface.
//!
//! The table is the single definition of the sidebar strip, the search index,
//! the location trail, the keyboard cursor, and which renderer a pane gets. A
//! pane cannot exist without a row, or a row without a pane — the registry's
//! own tests hold both directions — so adding a category is adding a row and
//! a renderer, never editing the shell.
//!
//! Each pane also declares what backs it, because a settings surface that
//! cannot say why a category is empty is a surface that lies about the
//! machine. [`PaneBacking`] is that declaration, and its three answers are
//! three different facts to a reader: the pane composes real controls,
//! nothing in this system can serve it at all, or the readings and writes
//! exist and this surface does not yet compose them — in which case the row
//! says where the setting is reached. No row takes that third answer today;
//! every category this system can serve composes its own controls, and the
//! rest state what is missing.
