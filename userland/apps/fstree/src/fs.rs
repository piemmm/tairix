//! The [`Fs`] seam: everything the file manager asks of the filesystem.
//!
//! The model is I/O-free; every directory read and free-space query goes
//! through this trait. The `Run` binary implements it over the
//! kernel-authorised `fs_*` syscalls (every per-inode and mount check stays
//! kernel-side, and a refusal comes back as the frozen [`Errno`] the model
//! surfaces on its message line); the tests implement it over an in-memory
//! tree, so the whole session is drivable without a kernel.
