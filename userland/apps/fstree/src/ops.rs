//! The file-operation planner and executor over the [`Fs`] seam.
//!
//! Every mutation the panes trigger — copy, move, rename, delete, mkdir —
//! is planned and validated here before any I/O, then driven by the
//! resumable [`FileOp`] executor so a per-file overwrite question can pause
//! the work, hand the decision to the key loop, and continue. The executor
//! streams file bytes through a bounded buffer (never a whole-file slurp),
//! reads directories incrementally as it reaches them, and fails closed:
//! the first refused step aborts the operation with the kernel's own
//! [`Errno`], and a partially written file is removed rather than left
//! looking complete.
//!
//! # A symbolic link is a name, not the thing it names
//!
//! Every verb acts on the link: a copy **recreates** it with the same stored
//! target (streaming its bytes would leave a regular file holding the
//! target's text), and a move or a delete acts on the link while what it
//! named survives. A link already sitting at a destination is asked about and
//! then **removed** before the new object is created, because a create or
//! truncate follows a final link and would otherwise act on whatever it
//! pointed at — which is why the destination probe never follows one
//! ([`crate::fs::Fs::stat_kind`]).
