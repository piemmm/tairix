//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `mdadm` tool — the program a shell
//! spawns to inspect and administer RAID arrays.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global
//! allocator, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` collects the inherited argument vector, reads the `LANG` locale
//! preference from the inherited environment (the shell exports it; the tool
//! invents no second source), and runs the parsed command against the
//! production seams: the shared System Information client
//! (`tairix_procinfo::raid_arrays` / `raid_members`) for the reads, a single
//! `ipc_call` to the composer's control endpoint for the mutations, the shared
//! `tairix_help::BundleHelp` for the short-help switches, and `RtOutput`, which
//! writes the report to the inherited standard output (with the advisory
//! records on fd 3, best-effort) and diagnostics to standard error. The tool
//! binds only to its inherited descriptors, never a console device, and holds
//! no ambient authority.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
