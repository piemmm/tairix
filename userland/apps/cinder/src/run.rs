//! The `cinder.app` bundle's `Run` entry point: the desktop companion.
//!
//! Everything with behaviour lives in the host-tested model (`tairix_cinder`);
//! this binary composes it over the live window channel:
//!
//! * a playpen window, opened exactly as any application's is;
//! * a **desktop layer surface** for when Cinder is let out, opened through
//!   the capability-gated `OpenLayer` and placed in screen coordinates;
//! * one `port_bind`-bound event mailbox the app **parks** on, accepting only
//!   events whose kernel-attested sender is the session the create reply
//!   named;
//! * a park carrying the next animation frame's deadline, and *no* deadline at
//!   all when Cinder is asleep and nothing moves, so a dozing companion costs
//!   no wake;
//! * a worker the saved-mood write is handed to, because that write is an IPC
//!   round trip to the settings service and this loop owes a frame.
//!
//! Closing the pen never quits: Cinder is a resident icon-bar application, so
//! closing puts him away (or leaves him roaming) and *Quit* is what ends him.
//! Being refused a place on the desktop is likewise not fatal — the reason is
//! stated and the pen carries on.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
