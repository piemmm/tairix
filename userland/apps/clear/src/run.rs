//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `clear` tool — the program a shell
//! spawns to clear the terminal screen.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global
//! allocator, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` collects the inherited argument vector (the reserved `-h`/`-?`
//! short-help switches render the tool's own Help document through the
//! shared engine and exit; `-x` is accepted for GNU compatibility, see
//! [`tairix_clear`]), resolves the terminal's capabilities from the
//! inherited `TERM` (fail-closed: unknown degrades to the dumb baseline),
//! and writes the encoded home + erase-display sequence to standard output
//! (fd 1). The tool binds only to its inherited descriptors, never a
//! console device.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
