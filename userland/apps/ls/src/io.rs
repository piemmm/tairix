//! The seams through which `ls` touches the outside world, and the data they
//! carry.
//!
//! Keeping the filesystem and the terminal behind object-safe traits is what
//! lets the listing logic in [`crate::client`] run against in-memory fixtures
//! with no kernel, mirroring the seam design of the other userland crates
//! (`init`'s `Spawner`/`Reaper`, `login`'s `LoginView`, `sysinfo`'s `Transport`,
//! `cat`'s `FileSource`, `man`'s `BundleStore`).
//!
//! The vocabulary is the frozen `abi-v1` one: an entry's kind is the VFS's
//! own [`FileKind`] — the tool defines no parallel kind enum that could
//! drift from what the kernel actually reports.
