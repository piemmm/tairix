## NAME

widgets — Reactive Alloy widget gallery

## SYNOPSIS

`widgets`

## DESCRIPTION

Opens a desktop window that demonstrates every shared TAIRiX GUI control on
its own tab: buttons, selectors, value controls, text fields, choice controls,
collections, bars, feedback surfaces, and window controls. Each tab shows
several variations of its family — different roles, states, and values — so the
full behaviour of each control is visible and interactive in one place.

Switch tabs by clicking the tab strip or with the `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, and
`End` keys and `Enter`. Click a widget to interact with it: a toggle flips, a
slider moves, a text field takes the caret, a combo box opens. A clicked widget
keeps the keyboard focus, so the arrow keys, `Enter`, `Space`, and typed
characters then drive it; `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` move focus between the tab
strip and the widgets. Turning the wheel scrolls the widget under the pointer.

The gallery is launched from the desktop's Program Library (the taskbar's
Library button) or by name from a shell. It
requires a running graphical session: without one the window channel is
unreachable and the gallery reports the refusal on the standard error stream
and exits.

## EXIT STATUS

Zero after a clean close; non-zero when the window channel or the shared frame
region was refused (the reason is stated on the standard error stream).
