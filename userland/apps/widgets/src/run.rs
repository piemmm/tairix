//! The `widgets.app` bundle's `Run` entry point: the windowed Reactive Alloy
//! widget gallery (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`).
//!
//! Everything with behaviour worth testing lives in the host-tested gallery
//! model (`tairix_widgets`); this binary only composes it over the live window
//! channel, exactly as `userland/apps/files` composes `lib/browse`:
//!
//! * one `shm_create`d frame region granted to the reserved window endpoint
//!   (the zero-copy surface the session maps once at create);
//! * one `port_bind`-bound event mailbox the app **parks** on through its
//!   wait-set — never a poll loop. Every received event carries its sender's
//!   kernel-attested origin, and the app accepts only events from the session
//!   identity the create reply named, so no other process can feed it forged
//!   input (fail closed);
//! * the `WindowClient` calls (create / present / close) and the
//!   `WindowEvents` typed wait over the parked source.
//!
//! Delivered pointer and key events are mapped onto the shared desktop input
//! vocabulary and routed into the gallery, which draws the tab strip and the
//! selected family's panel of demo widgets and reflects each control's own
//! action back into it. A `CloseRequested` from the desktop closes the
//! window and leaves the gallery on the icon bar, where a click on its slot
//! opens the next one and *Quit* ends the program; every bring-up refusal
//! exits fail-loud with a reserved code and a stated reason on `stderr`.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
