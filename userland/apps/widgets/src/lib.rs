//! The Reactive Alloy **widget gallery** model (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`).
//!
//! This is the host-tested composition the `widgets.app` bundle's `Run`
//! binary drives. It owns no rendering of its own beyond layout: every widget
//! it shows is a shared [`tairix_controls`] control, drawn and driven by that
//! crate, so the gallery adds no second control implementation. The gallery is
//! merely their *owner* — it lays each control out within the window client
//! rectangle, routes a pointer event to the control under the pointer and a
//! key to the one under focus, and reflects that control's typed action
//! straight back into it (a toggle flips, a slider moves, a field edits), so
//! the demo is genuinely interactive without touching any privileged service.
//!
//! The composition presents only client content (the compositor draws the
//! window frame, title bar, and command buttons server-side): a tab strip
//! selecting one control family, and a panel of captioned demo widgets for the
//! selected family. Each family lives on its own tab and shows several
//! variations — different roles, states, and values — so the full behaviour of
//! each control is legible in one place.
