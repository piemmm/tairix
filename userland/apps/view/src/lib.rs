//! The `view.app` engine: the document model, the viewport, and the
//! request/answer desk a picture is drawn from.
//!
//! Host-tested and free of both windows and I/O. The engine never decodes a
//! document and never reads one: it *records* what it wants drawn and
//! *collects* what came back, so a paint draws only from state it already
//! holds. `Run` is what carries a request out, on a worker thread, against
//! the capability-empty sandbox worker that does the decoding.
//!
//! # What the viewer holds, and in which space
//!
//! A page has a natural pixel size — its own, or a drawing's rounded source
//! extent. The user may turn or mirror it, which gives the **displayed**
//! size; the zoom scales that; and the canvas shows a window of the result.
//! Three spaces therefore exist, and the engine is careful about which one a
//! value is in:
//!
//! * **page space** — the page's own axes. The render request is in this
//!   space, because the worker holds the page and knows nothing of the user's
//!   turn.
//! * **display space** — page space set down through [`Reorient`]. What the
//!   canvas shows a window of, and what a pointer position means.
//! * **window space** — the window's own pixels, which [`Layout`] divides.
//!
//! A turn is a permutation of pixels the app already holds, so it is applied
//! here rather than in the worker: the wire is straight alpha and the app
//! holds premultiplied pixels, so turning in the worker would be a lossy
//! round trip for no gain.
