//! The `view.app` bundle's `Run` entry point: the picture and document
//! viewer.
//!
//! # The capability story
//!
//! The manifest requests **no filesystem capability**: on its own this
//! program can open, list, and stat nothing. A document reaches it one of two
//! ways, and both are the user's own act — a read-only descriptor the file
//! manager had the kernel clone in at spawn, or a one-shot `fd_grant` the
//! session's trusted picker delegated after the user chose a file in the
//! *session's* UI under the *session's* authority.
//!
//! The document is then untrusted input, so it is never decoded here: the
//! bytes are streamed to a capability-empty worker this same binary is
//! re-entered as, which holds no filesystem reach at all and answers pixels.
//! A malformed or hostile file crashes that worker and nothing else.
//!
//! # One instance, many windows, resident
//!
//! The viewer is a *single* instance with a window per document: a second
//! document opens a second window in this process rather than a second
//! process, which is the rule for every application with an icon-bar slot.
//! It stays on that slot with no window open — launched by the user it shows
//! nothing at all until it has something to display — and only the slot's
//! *Quit* row ends it.
//!
//! Each window holds its own engine, its own sandbox in the decode worker,
//! and its own open and render state, so a malformed file refuses in its own
//! window and disturbs no other.
//!
//! # What runs where
//!
//! Everything with behaviour worth testing is in the host-tested
//! [`tairix_view`] engine: the document model, the viewport, the one layout,
//! the command set, the input routing and the renderers. This binary composes
//! them over the live syscalls, and keeps two things off the loop that owes
//! the user a frame — reading the file, and driving the sandbox — because
//! both wait on something. They run on the shared worker desk; the loop
//! submits and carries on drawing.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
