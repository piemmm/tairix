//! TAIRiX `configure` — read and set the boot-time system-configuration
//! store (`plans/APPS.md`).
//!
//! The `sysctl`-shaped settings command: with no operand it lists every
//! setting of the closed registry with its current value; with a key it
//! shows that setting; with a key and a value it updates the store at
//! `/System/Settings/Configuration/system.conf`
//! (`tairix_sysconfig::CONFIG_PATH`). The store's grammar, key registry,
//! fail-closed parse, and canonical render are the shared `lib/sysconfig`
//! engine — the same engine every boot-time consumer reads through, so this
//! writer and those readers can never diverge.
//!
//! # Two registries, one command line
//!
//! A key name resolves against the flat `lib/sysconfig` registry first and,
//! failing that, against the per-interface `<iface>.<suffix>` registry of
//! the network store at `/System/Settings/Network/network.conf`
//! (`tairix_netconfig::CONFIG_PATH`). The flat registry always wins, so no
//! interface alias can ever shadow a machine setting — and the two name
//! sets are pinned disjoint by a test over both registries rather than left
//! to the accident that none collides today.
//!
//! Both registries are settable. An invocation names keys from either, they
//! are resolved against one working copy of each document before a byte is
//! written, and only a document the invocation actually names is rewritten.
//! The per-interface registry has no defaults to fall back to, so it needs a
//! spelling for **unset**: the empty value. No key in that registry accepts
//! an empty value — the engine pins that — which is what makes the spelling
//! unambiguous, and it is what lets one invocation move an interface from a
//! static address to DHCP (`configure wan.ipv4.method dhcp wan.ipv4.address
//! "" wan.ipv4.gateway ""`), a change neither half of which is a consistent
//! document on its own.
//!
//! # What this crate is
//!
//! The pure, host-testable core of the tool: the [`parse`]r that maps a
//! command line to a [`Command`], and the [`run`] engine that executes it
//! against injected seams:
//!
//! * [`Store`] — read and replace the store document (the `Run` binary
//!   wires the syscall-backed file at `CONFIG_PATH`; tests wire an
//!   in-memory fixture).
//! * [`Output`] — write listings and values to the terminal.
//! * `HelpSource` (from `lib/help`) — the tool's own bundle `Help/` tree,
//!   rendered by the `-h`/`-?`/`--help` switches through the one shared
//!   engine (never embedded help text).
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! An unknown option or an extra operand is a usage error that changes
//! nothing; an unknown key or a value outside its key's closed set is
//! refused with the valid choices stated; a store document the shared
//! engine cannot fully parse refuses a *set* outright (never a guessed
//! merge) while a *list*/*show* reports the malformation honestly. A
//! refused store read or write surfaces the underlying
//! [`Errno`] — a permission denial changes nothing and
//! states its reason. No panic, no partial application.
//!
//! # Layering & safety
//!
//! `no_std` (with `alloc`); the only dependencies are the audited `lib/abi`
//! crate, the shared `lib/help` engine, and the shared `lib/sysconfig`
//! engine, so this userland tool never links a kernel or driver crate. No
//! `unsafe`, and no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths; nothing
//! writes to fd 3 (`stdinfo`).
