## NAME

configure — read and set the boot-time system configuration

## SYNOPSIS

`configure [<key> [<value> [<key> <value>]...]]`

## DESCRIPTION

Lists, shows, and sets the settings of the system-configuration store
at `/System/Settings/Configuration/system.conf`. With no operand every
setting is listed with its current value; with a key alone that
setting's value is shown; with one or more `<key> <value>` pairs those
settings are changed together.

Several pairs are one change, not several: every pair is resolved and
applied to a working copy before a byte is written, and the store is
then rewritten once. A command line naming an unknown key, a value
outside its key's set, or the same key twice changes nothing at all,
so a group of settings can never be left half applied.

The store lives on the encrypted root volume and is parsed by its
consumers after the root filesystem is unlocked, so a change takes
effect the next time its consumer starts (`os.loginType`: the next
boot's login; the `cache.*` switches: the next boot's unlock).

The set of keys is closed: an unknown key, or a value outside a key's
set, is refused with the valid choices stated and changes nothing.
Changing a setting rewrites the store in its canonical form and
requires write access to `/System/Settings` — an ordinary account can
read the settings but not change them.

- `os.loginType` — `text` or `graphical`: which session type the login
  service starts for an authenticated user. `graphical` (the default)
  starts the desktop session directly after authentication, degrading
  to the text login on a machine that cannot run one; `text` starts the
  account's shell — the desktop can still be started on demand with the
  `desktop` command.
- `cache.all` — `on` or `off`: the master caching switch. `on` (the
  default) lets each cache class below follow its own setting; `off`
  is a ceiling that disables every memory cache regardless of the
  per-class settings.
- `cache.filesystem`, `cache.block`, `cache.transform`,
  `cache.semantic` — `auto` or `off`: the per-class switches for the
  four reclaimable memory caches (the filesystem, whole-disk block,
  decompressed-cluster, and application-launch caches). `auto` (the
  default) lets the memory-pressure manager govern the class; `off`
  disables it outright. There is no per-class `on`: a class cannot be
  forced to ignore memory pressure. A class is effectively `off`
  whenever `cache.all` is `off`.

Every cache is a reclaimable accelerator, never the source of truth, so
turning any or all of them off only makes the affected work slower — it
never changes a result.

- `net.ipv4.enabled`, `net.ipv6.enabled` — `true` or `false`: the
  stack-wide address-family switches. Both are `true` by default. A
  disabled family binds no addresses, answers no packets, and refuses
  a socket in that family with a typed error — never a silent drop.
- `net.ipv6.privacy` — `true` or `false`: whether the stack forms
  temporary (privacy) IPv6 addresses alongside the stable one. `false`
  (the default) uses the stable SLAAC address only.
- `net.tcp.syncookies` — `auto` or `always`: the SYN-flood defence
  policy. `auto` (the default) keeps a bounded half-open queue and
  falls back to stateless cookies on overflow; `always` answers every
  connection request statelessly. There is no `off` — an undefended
  connection queue is never a setting.
- `net.tcp.keepalive` — `true` or `false`: whether TCP connections
  send keepalive probes on an idle link. `false` (the default) never
  probes and never tears an idle connection down for inactivity;
  `true` probes an idle peer after the standard idle interval and
  drops the connection if the peer stops answering.
- `net.tcp.ecn` — `true` or `false`: whether TCP connections negotiate
  Explicit Congestion Notification. `false` (the default) leaves
  connections Not-ECT; `true` offers ECN in the handshake and, once
  negotiated, treats a congestion mark as a signal to slow down instead
  of forcing a packet drop.
- `net.sockets.mem` — `auto` or a byte size such as `64M`: the memory
  the network stack may hold in socket state across every principal.
  `auto` (the default) sizes it from the machine's own RAM, so a large
  server is not held to a figure chosen on a small one; a size overrides
  that for a workload you know better. Each principal may hold a
  sixteenth of the effective budget, so there is always room for sixteen.
  Bytes rather than a socket count, because the same number of sockets is
  a few kilobytes when idle and megabytes when fully buffered: the budget
  carries many quiet connections or fewer busy ones, as the workload
  really is.
- `time.servers` — `none` or a comma-separated list of network time
  servers, each a host name or an address literal. `none` (the default)
  means the clock is never set from the network: TAIRiX has no time-server
  pool of its own, so naming a server is the operator's choice rather than
  a default aimed at somebody else's service.
- `time.refresh` — `6h`, `12h`, `1d`, `2d`, or `7d`: how much uptime
  passes between clock re-queries once the time is known. `1d` is the
  default. A clock that is unset, implausible, or long stale is corrected
  as soon as the network allows, whatever this says.
- `input.mouse.debounce` — whole milliseconds, `25` by default, `0` to
  disable, at most `100`: how long after a mouse button is released the same
  button's next press is ignored as switch chatter instead of starting a new
  click. A worn switch can report a second press a few milliseconds after the
  release that it meant as one click. Set it to `0` for a mouse whose
  rapid-fire mode sends deliberate click pairs.
- `audio.output`, `audio.input` — `auto` by default, or an endpoint's
  location as `audioctl` lists it (sixteen hex digits, a dot, and the
  endpoint's index): the sink and the source this machine prefers as its
  defaults. A session's own choice comes first; this is the choice before
  anyone signs in and on a machine with no desktop. `auto` is the first
  device found.
- `audio.level` — decibels, `0dB` by default, or an attenuation such as
  `-12dB` or `-6.5dB`, to at most two decimals: the level every sink and
  source starts at. Never above `0dB`. The audio service takes a changed
  value at the next boot; `audioctl` changes the running machine.

A key that is not in the list above is read against a second registry:
the per-interface settings of the network store at
`/System/Settings/Network/network.conf`. Its keys are spelled
`<interface>.<setting>`, where `<interface>` is the alias an
administrator gave a network interface (`wan`, `lan0`) and `<setting>`
is one of `kind`, `match.mac`, `match.node`, `ipv4.method`,
`ipv4.address`, `ipv4.gateway`, `ipv6.method`, `ipv6.address`,
`ipv6.gateway`, `dns.servers`, `mtu`, `bond.members`, `bond.mode`,
`bond.monitor-interval`, and `bond.primary`.

The machine registry above is always searched first, so an interface
alias can never take a machine setting's name over.

That document holds only what an administrator wrote — it has no
defaults — so listing shows just the settings it carries, and showing
one it does not carry answers with an empty line rather than inventing
a value. Reading or changing it needs an account that may: it carries
each interface's hardware identity and this machine's static
addressing, which are not world-readable.

Because that registry has no defaults, a setting is removed rather than
reset, and an **empty value** is how you remove one:
`configure wan.ipv4.address ""`. No per-interface setting accepts an
empty value, so the spelling can never be mistaken for setting one. This
is what lets one command move an interface from a static address to
DHCP — `configure wan.ipv4.method dhcp wan.ipv4.address "" wan.ipv4.gateway ""`
— a change neither half of which describes a configuration that holds
together on its own. An interface whose last setting is removed is no
longer declared at all.

The whole edited document is checked before anything is written: a
change that would leave it inconsistent (a static method with no
address, a bond with fewer than two members) is refused and nothing is
written.

Changing a `net.*` setting, or a per-interface one, saves it and delivers
it to the running network stack, so it takes effect at once. Only the
interfaces the change actually affected are delivered. If the running
stack does not accept a delivery — none is running, or your account may
not administer the network — the setting is still saved and `configure`
says so; it then applies at the next boot.

Two limits are reported rather than hidden. An interface you removed
from the document keeps running with the configuration the stack was
last given until the next boot, because the stack has no message that
retires one. An interface saved with neither `match.mac` nor
`match.node` can never be bound to a device, so it is saved and the
refusal stated.

## OPTIONS

- `-h, -?` — show this command's own short help.

## EXAMPLES

- `configure` — list every setting.
- `configure os.loginType` — show the boot-default session type.
- `configure os.loginType graphical` — boot to the graphical login.

- `configure cache.filesystem off` — disable only the filesystem cache.
- `configure net.ipv6.enabled false` — turn IPv6 off stack-wide.
- `configure time.servers 0.example.test,1.example.test` — set the
  network time servers the clock is synchronised from.
- `configure wan.ipv4.address` — show the static IPv4 address
  configured for the interface called `wan`.
- `configure wan.ipv4.address 10.0.0.7/24 wan.ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.1` —
  give `wan` a static IPv4 address and default gateway.
- `configure wan.ipv4.method dhcp wan.ipv4.address "" wan.ipv4.gateway ""`
  — move `wan` from static addressing to DHCP.
- `configure wan.dns.servers 9.9.9.9,2001:db8::53` — set the recursive
  name servers to use on `wan`.

## EXIT STATUS

- `0` — the listing, value, short help, or change was completed.
- `1` — a store could not be read or written (for example the caller
  may not change system settings, or may not read the network store),
  or the output could not be delivered.
- `2` — the command line was not understood, the key is unknown, the
  value is outside the key's set, or the change would leave the network
  configuration inconsistent.

## ENVIRONMENT

- `LANG` — the preferred locale for the short help (a BCP-47 tag such
  as `fr-FR`).

## SEE ALSO

- `man`
