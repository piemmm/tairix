//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `yes` tool — the program a shell
//! spawns to repeatedly output a line of text.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global
//! allocator, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` collects the inherited argument vector, builds the repeated
//! output block, and pumps it to the inherited standard output (fd 1) until
//! the output stops accepting bytes or the process is terminated. The
//! reserved `-h`/`-?`/`--help` short-help switches render the tool's own
//! Help document through the shared engine. The tool binds only to its
//! inherited descriptors, never a console device.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
