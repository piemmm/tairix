//! The `datetime.app` bundle's `Run` entry point: the windowed Date & Time
//! application the desktop clock's *Set Date & Time…* row starts.
//!
//! # What this binary is, and what stays in the library
//!
//! The fields, their validation, the instant they compose, and the window's
//! geometry and paint all live in the host-tested `tairix_datetime` engine.
//! This binary composes them over the live syscalls exactly as the other
//! windowed apps do: one `shm_create`d frame region granted to the window
//! endpoint, one `port_bind`-bound event mailbox parked on through a
//! wait-set (every accepted event authenticated against the session identity
//! the create reply named), and the `WindowClient` calls over `ipc_call`.
//!
//! # It is *given* the authority, and never assumes it
//!
//! Stepping the machine's clock needs `CAP_TIME_SET`, which this bundle's
//! signed manifest requests and the kernel grants only as
//! `manifest ∩ the launching account's ceiling`. The desktop that starts
//! this app holds no such capability: it re-authenticates an account that
//! does, through the console's elevation broker, and the broker starts this
//! program as that account.
//!
//! So a refused set is an ordinary outcome, not a bug: an account whose
//! ceiling withholds `CAP_TIME_SET` gets `PermissionDenied`, and the app
//! **says so in its window and on `stderr` and keeps running**. It never
//! reports a clock it did not change as changed.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
