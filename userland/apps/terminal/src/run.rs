//! The `terminal.app` bundle's `Run` entry point (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW4,
//! `plans/GUI-TERMINAL.md`): the windowed terminal emulator hosting the
//! user's shells over the desktop session's window channel.
//!
//! # One process, many windows
//!
//! A terminal window is not an application: the application is the emulator,
//! and each of its windows is one hosted shell. So this is **one process
//! with a `Vec` of windows** — each carrying its own pseudo-terminal, shell
//! child, screen model, retained picture, look, and overlay — parked on one
//! wait-set that carries one event mailbox for the whole process plus that
//! window's own shell-output and child members. Opening another window costs
//! a pty, a spawn, a frame region, and two wait-set members; it costs no
//! second process, no second event mailbox, and no second icon-bar slot.
//!
//! That is what makes the desktop's icon bar honest. The bar shows
//! applications, so the terminal declares **one** presence
//! ([`tairix_terminal::appbar`]) whose slot stands for the emulator: a
//! primary click on it opens a fresh window, its menu offers *New window*
//! and *Quit*, and hovering it picks between the windows it owns. Closing
//! the last window puts the terminal away rather than ending it — the slot
//! stays, and a click there opens the next; only *Quit* closes them all and
//! ends the process.
//!
//! # What the program wires (and what stays in the libraries)
//!
//! Everything with behaviour worth testing lives in host-tested crates —
//! the screen model and its `lib/vt`-consuming parser (`tairix_terminal`),
//! the retained cell renderer (`tairix_terminal::render`), the user's profile
//! and its document, the screen-effect pipeline, the right-click menu, the
//! settings sheet, the spawned shell's pipe wiring, the icon-bar declaration,
//! and the window channel's client half (`tairix_window`). This binary only
//! composes them over the live syscalls:
//!
//! * Per window, two ends of one kernel pseudo-terminal: keystrokes flow to
//!   that shell's standard input and its cooked output flows back to that
//!   screen. The child-side end is closed here after the spawn, so the shell
//!   observes end-of-file the moment its window goes, and the window
//!   observes end-of-stream the moment the shell does.
//! * Per window, one `shm_create`d frame region granted to the reserved
//!   window endpoint (the zero-copy surface the session maps once at
//!   create).
//! * One wait-set the program **parks** on — never a poll loop — carrying
//!   its `port_bind`-bound event mailbox (every window's deliveries and the
//!   application-scoped icon-bar events, each accepted only from the session
//!   identity the squat-protected create reply named), one shell-output and
//!   one child member per window, the memory-pressure wake, and the settings
//!   worker's wake. When an animated screen effect is in force the park
//!   carries a one-shot frame deadline, so the animation costs one timed wake
//!   per frame and nothing at all when it is switched off.
//! * The user's own profile document, read at start-up under this process's
//!   own identity and rewritten on a worker thread whenever a *settled* edit
//!   asks for it. It is the *user's* profile, so every window shares it, and
//!   the loop never waits on the store: a slider drag applies live and asks
//!   for one write when it ends (`tairix_terminal::publish`).
//!
//! A key press is either a terminal command (a menu accelerator, or input
//! the open menu or settings sheet owns) or shell input encoded through the
//! one shared `lib/keymap` rule. Every bring-up refusal exits fail-loud with
//! a reserved code and a stated reason on `stderr`.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy,
//! and fmt still cover the file.
