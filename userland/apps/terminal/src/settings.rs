//! The in-window settings sheet: a modal panel the terminal draws over its
//! own screen, built from the shared Reactive Alloy controls
//! (`plans/GUI-CONTROLS-DESIGN.md`).
//!
//! The sheet edits a copy of the [`Profile`] it opened on and never touches
//! the caller's own copy: [`Settings::profile`] hands back the edited,
//! always-clamped result, and the caller re-resolves colours, re-derives the
//! font and repaints on [`SheetOutcome::Edited`], and additionally asks for the
//! profile to be published on [`SheetOutcome::Settled`].
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! The body of each tab is an ordered list of rows (a scheme choice, the text
//! size, the custom-scheme swatch grid, a channel slider, an effect slider),
//! laid out top to bottom at the theme's control height and gap through
//! [`Scale`], unscrolled, from the body's own top. The body shows them through
//! a pixel-scrolled [`ScrollView`], so a row the body's edge crosses is drawn
//! whole and cut by that edge, and only the part of it that shows takes the
//! pointer. Drawing, hit-testing and damage all read one resolved layout, so
//! they cannot disagree.
//!
//! # Keyboard model
//!
//! Tab/Shift-Tab moves focus between rows (including the tab strip itself,
//! the scrollbar, and the footer buttons); the keys a focused control's own
//! `on_key` understands — arrows, Space/Enter, Page Up/Down, Home/End — drive
//! that control. A key on a row scrolls the body the least that shows it, so
//! every setting stays reachable from the keyboard however small the window
//! is. Escape and the *Done* button dismiss the sheet; a primary press outside
//! the panel also dismisses it, since the sheet is modal and nothing outside
//! it is reachable while it is open. The wheel scrolls the body under the
//! pointer and moves no focus.
