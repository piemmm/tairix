//! The settings sheet's picture, retained between frames, and the rectangle
//! it owes its next paint.
//!
//! [`crate::render::Screen`] is this for the terminal's grid; this is it for
//! the sheet, and for the same reason. The sheet's controls already report the
//! rectangles they change — that is what the shared damage sink is for — but
//! the popup was re-derived from nothing on every pointer sample: a
//! whole-sheet surface allocated afresh, every tab, row, label and swatch
//! re-rendered, and the whole window presented. A slider drag delivers samples
//! as fast as a hand moves, so the cost of one edit was the cost of the whole
//! sheet, several dozen times a second, and the knob lagged the pointer.
//!
//! Retaining the picture is what makes a reported rectangle worth anything:
//! the pixels outside it are already right, so the paint clips to what moved
//! and the present carries only that.
