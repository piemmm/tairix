//! Painting the terminal's screen into a pixel [`Surface`].
//!
//! [`Screen`] owns the window-sized premultiplied-alpha surface the grid is
//! drawn into and **keeps it between frames**. Each
//! [`paint`](Screen::paint) compares the [`Grid`] against the cells the
//! surface was last painted from, redraws only the block that differs, and
//! returns that block as a surface rectangle — the damage the app presents.
//! A keystroke therefore costs the cell it wrote and the two the cursor
//! moved between, not a whole-window render, copy, and recomposite.
//!
//! Each [`Cell`] is drawn with its own rendition: the
//! [`Attributes`](tairix_vt::Attributes) the shared `lib/vt` parser folded
//! onto it choose the foreground and background, which are resolved through
//! the profile's [`Painted`] colours — the one place a terminal colour comes
//! from. The surface is the window manager's to place and round: the terminal
//! paints a *rectangular* buffer and the compositor applies any corner radius
//! through its single anti-aliased rounded-corner path.
//!
//! # What the diff is allowed to assume
//!
//! Two equal cells paint identically **only** under the same colours and the
//! same face, so a caller that changes either must
//! [`invalidate`](Screen::invalidate) first; a resize does it implicitly.
//! Nothing else can make a retained pixel stale: the cursor block is tracked
//! alongside the cells, and a cell is compared whole (glyph *and* rendition).
//!
//! The monospace face carries no separate bold/italic/underline glyphs, so
//! those parsed attributes do not change the rendered shape — a renderer
//! limitation, not a parsing gap. A wide glyph's continuation cell paints
//! background only; the lead glyph covers it, so a damaged block is widened
//! to whole glyphs before it is drawn.
//!
//! Every length saturates and every blit clips, so a viewport smaller than
//! the grid paints what fits rather than panicking.
//!
//! Translucency is not a separate step: the default background is filled at
//! the alpha the profile asks for, so the compositor's own premultiplied
//! blend shows what is behind the window while a glyph drawn over it stays
//! opaque. The screen effects ([`crate::effects`]) are a post-process over a
//! copy of the finished picture, so they never accumulate into the retained
//! surface.
