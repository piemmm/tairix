//! What a round moved in the listing view, as the rectangles it repainted.
//!
//! # Why a mark rather than a control report
//!
//! The listing has no retained control tree: every row and tile is built
//! afresh from the browser's own state each frame ([`tairix_browse::render`]),
//! so there is no control to report its own bounds when a highlight moves.
//! What *did* move is therefore the difference between two readings of that
//! state — the focused entry and the scroll offset — resolved back to
//! rectangles through the renderer's own geometry, so the reported rectangle
//! and the painted one are the same fact.
//!
//! Everything else the view draws (the entries themselves, the toolbar's
//! enable states, the view mode) changes only when the listing is replaced,
//! which is a whole-window repaint the caller concludes for itself.
