//! The running long operation's modal input routing: what a polled event means
//! while a recursive delete, a move to Trash, or a paste is running.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module
//!
//! The `Run` binary around it is a freestanding program — it only exists when
//! the crate is built for a bare-metal target — so nothing inside it can be
//! reached by a host test. Which press cancels a running operation is worth
//! testing: it is a pure function of the event, the window, and the drawn rail,
//! so it lives here, compiles on the host, and is covered by the tests beside
//! it.
//!
//! # No I/O, and no authority
//!
//! Nothing here touches the operation, the filesystem, or the window. It
//! classifies one event and the program acts on the answer.

        // on the next step — and a released frame region is re-attached by the
        // same present. A desktop change is already adopted by the caller
        // before this is reached. The alternate close means "leave this folder",
        // which would move the listing the running operation is walking, so it
        // is ignored while the panel is up rather than deferred. An icon-bar
        // click or any menu outcome names a gesture, and acting on it
        // would take the running operation somewhere the user cannot see, so
        // it too waits for the panel to go. An open target waits too: the
        // queue keeps it, so the drain happens when the panel is down rather
        // than navigating the listing this operation is walking.
        // The layer-surface feeds address a desktop surface this application
        // never opens, so they cannot arrive here at all; they are listed
        // rather than caught by a wildcard so a new event still has to be
        // thought about.
        // The rest is input that must not navigate behind the modal panel.
