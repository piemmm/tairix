//! The file manager's command line: the starting location a caller may name,
//! and the reserved short-help switches.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module
//!
//! The `Run` binary around it is a freestanding program — it only exists when
//! the crate is built for a bare-metal target — so nothing inside it can be
//! reached by a host test. Deciding what a command line means is worth
//! testing: which spellings open a folder, which are turned down and with what
//! reason, and which are a usage error the program refuses outright. All of
//! that is a pure function of the argument vector, so it lives here, compiles
//! on the host, and is covered by the tests beside it.
//!
//! # The grammar
//!
//! `files [--desktop] [directory]`, with the argument conventions every other
//! command app follows: `-h`/`-?`/`--help` win immediately, `--` ends option
//! parsing, and at most one operand is accepted.
//!
//! # The two roles
//!
//! The switch selects which of two things this program is ([`Role`]). Without
//! it — from a shell, or when the desktop opens a folder — it is the ordinary
//! file manager: one window, the shared icon-bar menu convention, and the
//! process ends when that window closes. With it, the desktop session is
//! starting the program as a **component of itself**: a permanent icon-bar
//! slot offering the user's places and whatever is mounted, no window until
//! one is asked for, and no way to quit. Only the session passes the switch,
//! so a second component can never appear; and because a component opens no
//! window at start, naming a starting location alongside it is a command line
//! this program cannot act on rather than an argument silently ignored.
//!
//! # Untrusted input, and the two different refusals
//!
//! The operand comes from whoever launched the program — the desktop opening
//! a folder, a shell, or something hostile — so it is validated before it is
//! used, through the one shared path grammar rather than a second parser here.
//! There are deliberately two outcomes:
//!
//! * A **malformed or out-of-bounds location** ([`Start::refused`]) is a
//!   refusal the program states and recovers from: the window still opens,
//!   among the launching user's own files. A bad argument never leaves the
//!   user with no window.
//! * A **command line the program cannot act on at all** ([`UsageError`]) — an
//!   unrecognised option, or a second operand — is refused outright, as in
//!   every other command app: guessing which of two operands was meant would
//!   be worse than saying so.
//!
//! Nothing here opens, lists, or writes anything: whether the accepted
//! location can actually be listed is the filesystem's decision, made under
//! the launching user's own identity by the program around this module.
