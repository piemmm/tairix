//! The file manager's icon-bar declaration: what its slot on the desktop's
//! bar offers in each of its two roles.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module
//!
//! The `Run` binary around it is a freestanding program — it only exists when
//! the crate is built for a bare-metal target — so nothing inside it can be
//! reached by a host test. What the slot offers is worth testing: which places
//! become rows, in what order, which are refused, what happens at the row cap,
//! and how a chosen row maps back to the place it names. All of that is a pure
//! function of the [`Places`] model, so it lives here, compiles on the host,
//! and is covered by the tests beside it.
//!
//! # Two roles, two declarations
//!
//! In the ordinary [`Role::Window`](crate::command::Role::Window) role the app
//! is an application like any other and makes the shared declaration — the
//! information row and *Quit*, with the session raising a window it has and
//! asking for one when it has none ([`WINDOW_SLOT_CLICK`]).
//!
//! In the [`Role::Desktop`](crate::command::Role::Desktop) role it is a
//! component of the desktop, and the slot is the user's way *into* the
//! filesystem rather than a handle on one window. So it offers neither of the
//! convention's rows — a component states no identity panel of its own and is
//! not the user's to quit — and instead lists the places the browser's own
//! rail lists: the user's home and folders, the machine's roots, then whatever
//! is mounted right now. Choosing one opens a window there, and a primary
//! click on the slot opens one among the user's own files
//! ([`DESKTOP_SLOT_CLICK`]).
//!
//! # The row cap is a display cap, and it is stated
//!
//! An icon-bar menu holds at most [`APP_MENU_MAX_ROWS`] rows, which the fixed
//! places and a busy machine's volumes can exceed. The rows past the cap are
//! **dropped**, and how many is reported to the caller so it can say so —
//! a truncated list that claims to be the whole one would be worse than a
//! short one that admits it.

/// than one long list. A row carries the place's own index as its id, so a
/// place that had to be skipped shifts nothing: the caller resolves a chosen
/// row through [`place_of`] and lands on exactly the place the user saw.
