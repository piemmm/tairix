//! What the file manager reads off its event loop, and the policy that decides
//! when it has an answer.
//!
//! Every read this app makes is a read of somebody's disk: the directory the
//! user navigated to, the folder cue each visible folder draws, and the program
//! stores the *Open With…* chooser is built from. Run on the loop that owes the
//! window a frame, each one freezes the window for as long as that disk takes —
//! which on a slow or contended device is not a frame but a visible stall.
//!
//! So they run on a worker, and the loop learns an answer landed through the
//! wait-set it already parks in. The listing and scan policies are the shared
//! ones ([`tairix_browse::ListingDesk`] and `tairix_util::defer::JobDesk`, the
//! latter linked into the target build alone); what is here is the one policy
//! neither covers.
//!
//! # The folder-occupancy probe
//!
//! A folder draws an empty/non-empty cue, and the only way to know which is to
//! read the folder. The renderer asks for the cue of every folder it draws, on
//! every frame, so the ask must cost nothing: [`Probes`] answers what it
//! already knows and *records* the rest, which is what lets a paint resolve
//! occupancy while performing no I/O at all.
//!
//! The recorded set is drained as one batch rather than one probe per wake: a
//! screenful of folders would otherwise be a screenful of repaints.
//!
//! # The Properties read
//!
//! A Properties window describes one node, which is one `fs_stat` plus one
//! call per extended-attribute key — thirty-odd round trips for a node
//! carrying a full set. [`PropertyReads`] is keyed by *window*, because
//! several Properties windows are open at once and one window's read must not
//! displace another's; a re-read of the same window supersedes its own
//! outstanding one, since only the latest answer describes the node now.
