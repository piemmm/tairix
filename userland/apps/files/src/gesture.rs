//! What a pointer gesture on a listed item means.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module
//!
//! The `Run` binary around it is a freestanding program — it only exists when
//! the crate is built for a bare-metal target — so nothing inside it can be
//! reached by a host test, exactly as for [`crate::command`]. Which gesture
//! opens what is worth testing: a modifier changes what activating a bundle
//! means, a second press of the *same* button completes a different gesture
//! from a second press of the other one, and a press that lands on nothing
//! must break the run rather than pair across it. All of that is a pure
//! function of the press and the remembered one, so it lives here and is
//! covered by the tests beside it.
//!
//! # The three gestures
//!
//! | gesture | what it does |
//! |---|---|
//! | double-click | activate: descend, run a bundle, or open a file |
//! | shift-double-click | list a bundle's contents instead of running it |
//! | right-click | ask the desktop for the context menu on the item |
//!
//! There is no right-*double*-click: the menu the first press opens is the
//! desktop's chain and holds the seat's grab, so the second press is consumed
//! there and never reaches this window. Its "open this and I am done here" verb
//! is a row of the menu instead ([`AfterHandoff::CloseWindow`], reached from
//! `ContextCommand::OpenAndClose`) — discoverable, and reachable from the
//! keyboard, which the gesture never was (`plans/NEW-MENUS.md` D20).
//!
//! The pairing rule itself is the shared engine's
//! ([`DoubleClickTracker`]) — keyed on the button as well as the item, so a
//! left press and a right press are never mistaken for one gesture.
