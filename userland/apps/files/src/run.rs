//! The `files.app` bundle's `Run` entry point (`plans/APPWIN.md` AW3):
//! the windowed file browser, the first app served over the desktop
//! session's window channel.
//!
//! # One binary, two roles
//!
//! Launched plainly — from a shell, or by the desktop opening a folder — this
//! is an ordinary application: one window at the location it was given, and
//! the shared icon-bar menu convention on its slot. Closing every window
//! puts it away rather than ending it: the slot stays, a click there opens a
//! window at the user's home, and *Quit* is what ends the process.
//!
//! Launched by the desktop session with `tairix_window::DESKTOP_ROLE_SWITCH`
//! it is instead a **component of the desktop**
//! ([`Role::Desktop`](command::Role::Desktop)): it comes up with the session,
//! holds a permanent icon-bar slot offering the user's places and whatever is
//! mounted, opens a window per place the user chooses (bounded by the
//! session's per-client frame budget), and cannot be quit at all — its menu
//! carries neither an information row nor *Quit*. Only the session passes the
//! switch, so a second component can never appear.
//!
//! # What the program wires (and what stays in the libraries)
//!
//! Everything with behaviour worth testing lives in host-tested crates —
//! the shared browser engine and its validated path spelling
//! (`tairix_browse`), the themed listing renderer
//! (`tairix_browse::render`), and the window
//! channel's client half (`tairix_window`). This binary only composes
//! them over the live syscalls:
//!
//! * One `shm_create`d frame region **per window**, granted to the reserved
//!   window endpoint (the zero-copy surface the session maps once at create).
//! * One `port_bind`-bound event mailbox the app **parks** on through
//!   its wait-set — never a poll loop, and one mailbox for every window and
//!   the icon-bar slot alike. Every received event carries its sender's
//!   kernel-attested origin, and the app accepts only events from the session
//!   identity the (squat-protected) desktop-query reply named: no other
//!   process can feed it forged input (fail closed). Learning that identity
//!   from the *query* rather than from a create reply is what lets a
//!   component answer its slot before it owns any window.
//! * The `WindowClient` calls (create / present / close) over `ipc_call`
//!   and the `WindowEvents` typed wait over the parked source.
//! * The grid's icon artwork: the shared reclaim-governed decode cache
//!   (`tairix_icon::artwork`) bound to a bounded VFS read and to the
//!   sandboxed icon rasteriser. The artwork is untrusted input, so it is
//!   decoded by a capability-empty worker this binary re-enters itself as
//!   — never in this process — and a missing, over-long, or disbelieved
//!   asset falls back to the built-in glyph rather than a blank tile. The
//!   decode happens between turns of the event loop, never inside a paint
//!   ([`crate::icons`]), so a folder of picture-bearing bundles neither
//!   freezes the first frame nor stalls a scroll. The same wait-set carries
//!   a memory-pressure member, so the retained pixels are trimmed when the
//!   machine's band changes and released when the app ends.
//!
//! Keyboard navigation drives the browser (`Down`/`Up` select, `Enter`
//! activates the selection — it descends into a directory or launches a
//! selected `<Name>.app` bundle by spawning the bundle's own `Run` through
//! the ordinary signed app-load gate (asynchronously, with the launched
//! child reaped on the wait-set's any-child member so it is never left a
//! zombie), and a launch refusal is stated fail-loud on `stderr`;
//! `Backspace` goes up); `F2` renames the selected
//! item through an inline `lib/controls` text field, committing over
//! `fs_rename` under the user's own identity (a refusal is stated in the
//! field, never a silent failure or a fabricated success); `Ctrl+X`/`Ctrl+C`
//! capture the selection onto a cut/copy clipboard and `Ctrl+V` pastes it
//! into the current directory — a same-volume move is one `fs_rename`, a
//! cross-volume move is copy-then-delete, and a copy streams the bytes in
//! bounded chunks, all under the user's own identity and stopping fail-loud
//! on `stderr` at the first refusal; `Delete` opens a modal confirmation
//! `Dialog` and, on confirm, removes the selection (recursively for a folder)
//! over the user's own `fs_unlink`s, stopping and stating the reason on
//! `stderr` on the first refusal; a `CloseRequested` from the desktop closes
//! that window, which ends an ordinary file manager cleanly once it was its
//! last. Every bring-up refusal exits fail-loud with a reserved code and a
//! stated reason on `stderr`.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy,
//! and fmt still cover the file.
