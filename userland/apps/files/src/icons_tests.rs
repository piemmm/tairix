//! Host tests for the grid's icon-artwork arrangement.
//!
//! The pinned defect is that a paint used to read and decode: the first frame
//! of a folder blocked on a sandbox round trip per visible tile. These drive
//! the real cache and desk over counting seams, so what a paint costs is
//! asserted rather than argued.
//!
//! The split the `Run` binary carries with a mutex and a reader thread is
//! driven here as direct calls: the paint side's [`IconPipeline`], the desk it
//! records misses on, and the reader's take/decode/deliver turn. The rules are
//! the same either way, because the decode is the shared
//! [`render_artwork`](tairix_icon::render_artwork) in both.
