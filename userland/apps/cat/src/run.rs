//! The `Run` entry-point binary of the `cat` tool — the program a shell
//! spawns to concatenate files and standard input to the terminal.
//!
//! This is a **pure-Rust** program: TAIRiX is Rust-only, so it links the Rust
//! userland runtime `tairix-rt` — never the C ABI, which exists solely for
//! programs *not* written in Rust. `tairix-rt` provides `_start`, the
//! per-process stack canary, the panic handler, the `mem_map`-backed global
//! allocator, and the syscall wrappers; `tairix_rt::entry!` names this
//! program's `main`.
//!
//! `main` collects the inherited argument vector, reads the `LANG` locale
//! preference from the inherited environment (plans/APPS.md §5 — the shell
//! exports it; the tool invents no second source), and runs the parsed
//! command against the production seams: `RtFileSource`, which reads every
//! named source through the one shared `tairix_procinfo::NamedSource` — paths
//! and stream references through the kernel, `info:`/`state:`/`stats:` values
//! through the `sysinfod` broker, each checked under the caller's attested
//! identity; `RtStdin`, which reads the inherited standard input; the shared
//! `tairix_help::BundleHelp` for the short-help switches; and `RtOutput`,
//! which writes the stream to the inherited standard output. The tool binds
//! only to its inherited descriptors, never a console device, and holds no
//! ambient authority.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy, and
//! fmt still cover the file.
