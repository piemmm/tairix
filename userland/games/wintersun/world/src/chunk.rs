//! One chunk of ground, and the resumable machine that builds it.
//!
//! # The halo, and why it is exactly this wide
//!
//! Everything here reads the realm field — which is global, so identical
//! for every query — plus pure functions of absolute position, plus a
//! **fixed ring of cells around the chunk**. The ring exists for one
//! stage: the shore distance, which is a distance transform and therefore
//! the only quantity a cell's neighbours can change. Its radius is
//! [`SHORE_CELLS`], and the transform is run over the chunk *plus* that
//! ring, so a cell inside the chunk gets the same answer it would get if
//! the whole world had been transformed at once. That is what makes "a
//! chunk generated alone equals the same chunk generated as part of its
//! neighbourhood" a theorem rather than a hope.
//!
//! # Why it is resumable
//!
//! A client must never block a frame on generation. The build is a
//! sequence of bounded phases, each advanced by one [`ChunkBuild::step`],
//! and the partially-built chunk is readable throughout — so a chunk that
//! is not yet finished draws as the coarse relief the earlier phase
//! already answered rather than as nothing. Stopping between any two
//! phases and resuming later produces the same chunk as running them
//! back to back, because no phase reads anything a later one writes.
