//! Domain-separated deterministic randomness.
//!
//! Every stage draws from its own stream, keyed by the realm seed *and* a
//! stage tag, so adding a stage cannot shift an earlier one's output and two
//! stages sampling the same lattice point never see the same number.
//!
//! Generation needs **random access**, not a sequence: a chunk asks for the
//! value at one lattice point without generating any of its neighbours. So
//! the primitive here is a keyed hash over coordinates rather than a
//! generator, and [`Stream`] exists only where a stage genuinely wants a
//! sequence — a plate's several parameters, a settlement's several rolls —
//! that would otherwise need a field tag nobody would keep unique.
//!
//! Neither is a new algorithm. The hash is `lib/hash`'s XXH64, whose writes
//! are little-endian on every port; the stream is `lib/rng`'s xoshiro256++.
