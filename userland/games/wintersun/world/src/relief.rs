//! Coarse relief: what the plates and the noise make of the ground, and
//! where the sea comes to.
//!
//! The heightfield is a weighted sum of three fields with different jobs.
//! Tectonic uplift decides *where* high ground is and gives a range its
//! direction. Domain-warped continental noise decides the shape of land
//! against sea. Ridged noise, admitted only in proportion to how strongly
//! a point sits in a mountain belt, gives the high ground its texture —
//! so ridges appear along belts and nowhere else.
//!
//! # Sea level is cut, not chosen
//!
//! A realm asks for a submerged fraction, not for a height. The stage
//! sorts the raw relief and cuts at the requested quantile, then shifts
//! every sample so the cut is zero. That way a realm's coastline is the
//! one the operator asked for whatever the noise happened to produce,
//! rather than an emergent property nobody controls.
