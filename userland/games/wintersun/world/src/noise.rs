//! The noise the relief stages are shaped from.

//! Value noise on an integer lattice, smoothstep-interpolated, summed over
//! octaves. Value rather than gradient noise because its lattice value is
//! one keyed hash — random access with no gradient table to keep identical
//! across targets — and because the octave sum, the ridging and the domain
//! warp are what give terrain its character, not the choice of kernel.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of `(key, stage, position)`. No state,
//! no caching, no traversal order: the value at a point is the same whether
//! it is the first point asked for or the millionth.
