//! What generation can refuse, and why.

/// A refusal from the generator.
///
/// Generation is pure arithmetic over an **already validated** parameter
/// document — [`RealmParams`](crate::params::RealmParams) has one
/// constructor and it checks every field — so a bad document is refused
/// before anything here runs. That leaves exactly one way to fail, and it
/// is a value rather than an abort: an exhausted machine gets a typed
/// refusal, never a panic.
