//! Drainage, lakes, discharge and erosion, over the whole realm at once.
//!
//! # The ordering problem, and how it is solved
//!
//! Flow accumulation is only meaningful if every cell is visited after
//! everything that drains through it, and that ordering does not exist
//! unless the drainage network is acyclic. A raw heightfield has pits and
//! flats, both of which produce cycles, and the usual fixes — nudging
//! every flat by an epsilon, or iterating until a fixed point — are either
//! numerically delicate or unbounded.
//!
//! Priority-Flood gives the ordering for free. Flooding the surface
//! inward from its outlets pops cells in non-decreasing filled height, so
//! **the pop order is itself a downstream-first ordering**: every cell is
//! popped after at least one neighbour it can drain to. Recording that
//! order gives three things at once — the depression-filled surface (so
//! lakes have a surface and an outflow), a guaranteed-acyclic routing
//! (each cell drains to its steepest neighbour *among those popped
//! earlier*), and the traversal order accumulation needs (the reverse).
//! No epsilon, no iteration to convergence, and no flats to special-case.
//!
//! # Erosion
//!
//! Detachment-limited stream-power incision (`E = K·√A·S`, the standard
//! `m = 1/2, n = 1` parameterisation) paired with linear hillslope
//! diffusion. That is deliberately a landscape-evolution model and not a
//! particle simulation: it is what cuts valleys along the drainage the
//! previous paragraph just established, and the diffusion is what lays the
//! flats in their floors. A bounded number of passes, each reading a
//! snapshot and writing a delta, so no pass depends on the order its cells
//! are visited in.
