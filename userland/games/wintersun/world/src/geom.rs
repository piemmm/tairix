//! Chunk geometry, the quantised field units, and the conversions between
//! them.
//!
//! The wire owns the world *coordinate* vocabulary — [`WorldPoint`],
//! [`ChunkCoord`] and `WORLD_SUB_UNITS_PER_UNIT`. It deliberately does not
//! own the chunk's *shape*, because how finely the generator samples the
//! ground is the generator's question. That shape is defined once here and
//! imported everywhere else.
//!
//! # Why the field units are integers
//!
//! Generation computes in `f64` and stores integers. Every stored field —
//! elevation, temperature, precipitation and its season, discharge — is a
//! fixed-point integer, so the stored value is the same bit pattern on every
//! target whatever the intermediate arithmetic did. That is what makes a
//! state digest over the stored fields a meaningful cross-target claim rather
//! than a restatement of one host's rounding.
