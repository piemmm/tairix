//! The realm parameter document.
//!
//! A realm is a `u64` seed and this: eight numbers that decide how big the
//! world is, how finely it is solved, and what kind of place it is. Nothing
//! here is content — spells, items and biome tuning are declarative
//! documents elsewhere — and nothing here is a capacity the machine should
//! be choosing.
//!
//! # Every field is bounded, because this document is untrusted
//!
//! A client is handed its realm's parameters by the realm, and a realm is
//! no more trusted by a client than a client is by a realm. So this type
//! has one validating constructor and no public fields: an out-of-range
//! extent, a resolution that would not tile, or a temperature range that
//! would not quantise is refused with a reason rather than clamped into
//! something the two ends might disagree about. The bounds are fixed
//! security bounds on untrusted input and do not scale with the machine.
//!
//! This crate deliberately decodes no bytes. The wire encoding of these
//! fields belongs with the rest of the protocol in `wintersun/net`, which
//! already owns bounded decode and its fuzz harnesses; a second decoder
//! here would be a second place to get it wrong.
