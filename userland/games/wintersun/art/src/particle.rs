//! The particle vocabulary, and the bounded field that holds one.
//!
//! Rain, snow, embers, smoke, dust, sparks, splashes and blown leaves are
//! one mechanism with ten parameter sets, not ten systems. A kind says
//! how long its particles live, how heavily they fall, how hard the wind
//! pushes them, how they are tinted and how they fade; everything else is
//! shared.
//!
//! # Budget, not a constant
//!
//! How many particles a field may hold is derived from the area on screen
//! and the machine's current memory-pressure band, never from a number
//! picked here. A wide view in a blizzard on a machine with headroom
//! carries far more than a small window on a machine under pressure, and
//! neither is a configuration — it is the same policy reading a different
//! machine.
//!
//! # Retiring, and why the oldest goes
//!
//! A field at its budget that is asked for another particle retires its
//! oldest. Refusing instead would make a heavy emitter — the one at the
//! centre of what the player is looking at — starve behind a light one
//! that happened to fill the field first. Age is the fair thing to drop:
//! the oldest particle is the one nearest its own death anyway.
//!
//! "Retire the oldest, take the newest" is a queue, so the store is one.
//! A vector shifting every element down on each emission would be
//! quadratic in the budget exactly when the field is full — which is the
//! steady state of a storm, every frame — and the budget is derived from
//! the screen, so it grows with the machine that can least afford it.
