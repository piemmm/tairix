//! The splat: turning a cell's weight field into pixels.
//!
//! Terrain has no tile grid. A pixel is the blend of the materials its
//! cell holds — but blended by **height**, not by weight alone. Each
//! material carries its own surface relief, and where one stands proud of
//! the others it wins the pixel outright. That is the difference between
//! gravel emerging through grass in patches and the two averaging into a
//! grey that is neither.
//!
//! # A span, not a pixel
//!
//! The unit is a horizontal run of pixels inside one cell row, because
//! everything a pixel needs that is not its own texel read is linear
//! along that run: the weights interpolate between the run's two ends, and
//! so does the anti-repetition warp. Planning a run once and stepping it
//! turns four hash evaluations per pixel into four per *span*, which is
//! the difference between this pass fitting its budget and not.
//!
//! A caller therefore does the vertical interpolation itself — one
//! [`WeightField::lerp`] per cell row per raster row — and hands this
//! module the two ends of each horizontal run.
//!
//! # Repetition, and the one field that breaks it
//!
//! A synthesised tile is finite, so a lookup that was an affine function
//! of world position would show the tile's period across a large
//! grassland. The lookup is therefore displaced by a smooth, low-frequency
//! vector field ([`Warp`]) before it is taken.
//!
//! One warp field is all three of the jitters this needs. Its Jacobian
//! carries a local rotation, a local scale and a local offset together, so
//! there is no separate rotation to seam at a lattice boundary and no
//! separate scale to fight it: the field is continuous, therefore the
//! distortion is, therefore there is no edge anywhere for the eye to find.
