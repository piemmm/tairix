//! Materials, synthesised rather than shipped.
//!
//! A material is a handful of numbers — a palette ramp, a grain scale, a
//! relief depth, a roughness — from which its texture and its height field
//! are generated on the machine that draws them. Fifteen of those cost a
//! few hundred bytes in the binary where fifteen photographic tile sets
//! would cost megabytes on disk, and being generated they are
//! resolution-independent: a mip is not a downsample of a fixed master,
//! it is the same field evaluated at the scale it will be drawn at.
//!
//! # A texel is a colour and a height
//!
//! Four bytes: red, green, blue, and the height the splat resolves
//! materials by ([`Texel`]). The height is what makes gravel emerge
//! through grass in patches rather than the two averaging into a grey —
//! it is the material's own surface relief, so where the gravel stands
//! proud it wins the pixel outright.
//!
//! # Tiles must tile
//!
//! A tile is drawn end to end across a hillside, so every lattice the
//! synthesis reads wraps at the tile's own side ([`noise::Tiled`]). A
//! sampler that did not would put a seam on every repeat, and no amount
//! of anti-repetition jitter in the lookup would hide a discontinuity in
//! the source.
