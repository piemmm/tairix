//! The material cache.
//!
//! A synthesised tile is worth keeping while the ground it covers is on
//! screen and worth nothing afterwards, which is a cache — and a cache in
//! TAIRiX is governed rather than merely bounded. Its budget comes from
//! the memory the machine reported, its entries are charged to a ledger,
//! and it gives them back through the same pressure bands as every other
//! reclaimable cache in the system.
//!
//! Nothing here scales with the world's extent. The resident set is the
//! materials visible at the mips they are drawn at — at most every ground
//! times the handful of levels a camera spans, and in practice far fewer,
//! because a viewport shows a few biomes rather than all of them.
//!
//! The generation token is the [`Quality`] the tiles were synthesised at:
//! shed an octave and every held tile is stale by definition, which is the
//! honest invalidation rule for state derived from nothing else.
