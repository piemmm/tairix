//! Decals: roads, rivers and scars, stamped into the weight field.
//!
//! A road is not geometry laid over the ground and it is not a tile in a
//! grid. It is a **spline that raises its own ground's weight** where it
//! passes, so the ground blends it in through exactly the machinery
//! everything else goes through ([`WeightField::cover`]). That is what
//! makes a road *wear into* grass rather than sit on top of it, and it is
//! why two roads meeting merge instead of overlapping — the second stamp
//! at the same coverage is a no-op.
//!
//! The world generator already levels the terrain a road runs over and
//! flags the cells it touches, which is the road's *shape*. What it does
//! not do is decide what the road is made of or how its edge meets the
//! ground, because those are drawing questions. This is where they are
//! answered.
//!
//! # A hard edge is the tell
//!
//! A stamp with a step edge reads as a decal, because nothing in a
//! landscape has one. Two things stop that here: coverage falls off
//! smoothly through a feather band outside the carriageway, and the
//! distance the falloff is measured on is perturbed by a noise field
//! keyed on world position — so the edge frays at the scale of gravel
//! scattering into grass rather than running true.
