//! What the simulation advances: one body, its numbers, and its state.
//!
//! An entity is the whole of what a tick reads and writes. Nothing about it
//! is a client's to assert: the position is where the realm put it, the
//! health is what the realm's pipeline left, and the held direction is the
//! last movement intent the realm *admitted* — not the last one sent.
//!
//! # The carried remainder, and why movement needs one
//!
//! Speed is sub-units per tick and a held direction is a fraction of it, so
//! a step is a division — and a division that truncated every tick would
//! quietly make diagonal movement slower than cardinal, and a slow walk
//! slower still, in a way a player feels and cannot name. Each body
//! therefore carries the fractional part of its own step forward, so
//! displacement accumulates exactly. It is integer bookkeeping, so it costs
//! two words and nothing in determinism.
