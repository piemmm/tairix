//! Movement, and what bodies do when they run into things.
//!
//! Distance is never a number a client supplies. The realm takes the
//! direction a body is holding, multiplies it by the speed that body's own
//! stats and statuses allow, and resolves the result against the ground and
//! against everything else standing on it. A client claiming an impossible
//! step has not made a claim the realm reads.
//!
//! # All integer, on purpose
//!
//! A step is a fixed-point multiply, a floor and a remainder; a separation
//! is an exact integer square root. Nothing here is floating point, so the
//! cross-target claim rests on integer semantics Rust fully specifies rather
//! than on a libm agreeing with itself.
//!
//! # Sliding, and why the order is stated
//!
//! A body blocked on the diagonal tries the eastward part alone, then the
//! southward part alone, and stays put only if neither is clear. That is
//! what makes walking along a wall feel like walking along a wall rather
//! than sticking to it. The order matters — a body wedged in a corner with
//! both parts clear takes the eastward one — so it is stated here rather
//! than left to whichever branch came first.
//!
//! # The body is a box against the ground and a circle against bodies
//!
//! Terrain is tested over the bounding box of the body's circle, which is
//! conservative: a body cannot clip a corner into a wall, and pays for it
//! with a little slack at that corner. Body-against-body is the exact
//! circle test, because two players standing together is a thing players
//! look at and a box would read as wrong.
