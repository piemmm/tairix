//! The state digest, and the scripted run the determinism claim is staked
//! on.
//!
//! # Two uses, one fold
//!
//! A deterministic simulation has a state hash, and that hash does two jobs.
//! It is how a desync is *bisected*: a client and a realm exchange hashes
//! periodically, and on a mismatch the answer is "entity 412 diverged at
//! tick 90 113" rather than "the players disagree" — which is the difference
//! between minutes and days. And it is how the cross-target claim is
//! *stated*: every Tier-1 target runs one scripted session and asserts one
//! constant, [`REFERENCE_DIGEST`].
//!
//! Comparing two runs would prove nothing on its own, because both could be
//! wrong together. Agreement between targets follows from each agreeing with
//! the constant, so a target that has never been run cannot pass by
//! accident.
//!
//! # What the scripted run is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! It is a session: twelve bodies of differing stats walking a changing set
//! of directions over ground with obstacles in it, taking blows, being
//! healed, carrying statuses that stack and diminish, colliding with each
//! other, and one of them dying. The digest folds the *whole trajectory*,
//! every tick — not the final state — so a divergence that later converges
//! is still caught.
//!
//! Its ground is a pattern rather than a generated realm, and that is the
//! point: the world generator has its own determinism vertical and its own
//! constant, and conflating the two would make each fragile to the other's
//! changes while proving nothing extra. The claim here is about the
//! *simulation*.
