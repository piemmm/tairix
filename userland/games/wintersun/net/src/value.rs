//! The values messages are built from: identifiers, world geometry, entity
//! state, stored world edits, and play events.
//!
//! Identifiers are newtypes rather than bare integers so a character id
//! cannot be passed where an entity id belongs. The *meaning* of a kind, an
//! action, a spell, or an item is the realm's content, not this crate's: the
//! wire carries and bounds the number, and the simulation resolves it.
//!
//! Geometry is fixed point, not floating point: a wire value must be
//! bit-identical on every target and must not carry a NaN or an infinity a
//! decoder would then have to special-case. [`WorldPoint`] therefore counts
//! sub-units, and the sub-unit is a power of two so the world generator's
//! `f64` positions convert to it exactly in both directions.
