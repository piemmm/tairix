//! These are **security bounds on untrusted input**, not capacities: they
//! exist so a hostile peer cannot make a decoder read, iterate, or reserve
//! more than the protocol can legitimately produce. They do not scale with the
//! machine and they do not move to suit a caller — widening one to admit a
//! frame is a regression, not a fix. Where a *capacity* is genuinely wanted
//! (how many clients a realm serves, how much the gateway buffers) it belongs
//! with the resource-limit facility, not here.
//!
//! The record bound is **derived** from the largest message the encoders can
//! produce rather than picked. A hand-picked record cap that happened to sit
//! below a legal message would refuse honest traffic — a bound must be
//! consistent with the thing it bounds.
