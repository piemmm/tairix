//! The frame budget, measured rather than asserted about.
//!
//! `plans/WINTERSUN.md` states a per-pass allocation at 1280×720 on a
//! four-core reference machine and says plainly that it "is the single
//! most likely number in this plan to be wrong". This is where it stops
//! being a guess: the passes are timed at the baseline resolution over
//! generated terrain with the plan's sixty-four rigged figures standing on
//! it, along with what placing one of them costs a single core, and the
//! numbers are printed so a run says what the renderer actually costs.
//!
//! # Why no elapsed time is asserted here
//!
//! A wall-clock threshold in a test is a claim about the machine, not
//! about the renderer. The same unchanged code passes on a fast host and
//! fails on a slower one, so the failure says only that the host was
//! slow — a flake with the machine as its seed, and one that cannot be
//! fixed by retrying. The budget is therefore *evidence*: the milestone's
//! exit criterion is read from this output and recorded in the plan, and
//! nothing here fails because a host took longer. `cargo xtask bench`
//! states the same rule for the raster and compositor families, and
//! `kernel/mem`'s ramzip tiers and `kernel/core`'s reclaim integration
//! print their costs the same way.
//!
//! # What is gated, and where
//!
//! The deterministic claims about this code live where they can be made
//! without a clock: pass attribution against a controlled clock in the
//! crate's own `frame` tests, and the band decomposition in
//! `tests/bands.rs`. That file cuts a frame into bands on a *serial*
//! runner, so it tests the decomposition and says nothing about
//! threading. This is the only place a genuinely concurrent runner draws,
//! so the claim it can make — and does, below — is that handing the bands
//! to real threads yields the identical picture. A torn hand-off or an
//! overlapping slice changes a pixel on any machine, fast or slow.
//!
//! Read the numbers with:
//! `cargo test -p tairix-wintersun-app --release --test budget -- --nocapture`
