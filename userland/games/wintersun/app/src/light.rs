//! The low sun, and what it does to the ground.
//!
//! `WinterSun` is lit by a single directional light at a shallow angle.
//! That is an art direction and a simplification at once: long shadows, a
//! cold-to-warm gradient across every slope, and no light to trace — the
//! shading is the terrain's own gradient dotted with one vector.
//!
//! # Why a buffer rather than a term per pixel
//!
//! The result is low-frequency: it is a function of the ground's slope
//! and height, both of which vary over cells rather than pixels. So it is
//! accumulated into a buffer at a fraction of the render resolution and
//! upsampled, which is what makes it affordable and what gives the
//! degradation ladder a knob to turn that costs almost no fidelity for
//! most of its travel. The point lights a later item adds — lanterns,
//! fires, spell effects — accumulate into this same buffer rather than a
//! second one.
//!
//! The upsample has the same shape as the terrain pass: the two buffer
//! rows either side of an output row are interpolated once into a
//! scratch row, and the pixels step along it.
