//! The reference scene: one realm, one cast and one moment, drawn the same
//! wherever it is drawn.
//!
//! Three consumers draw it, and they must agree to the bit: the
//! cross-target digest folds it at two fixed sizes, `Run --reference-scene`
//! holds it in a live window, and the host renders it at that window's size
//! to check the pixels the compositor scanned out. So everything that decides
//! a pixel is fixed here rather than taken from the machine: the realm's
//! seed, the cast and the moment it is caught at, and the material cache's
//! size. Pressure alone is the caller's, and a drawing it cost a tile is
//! refused rather than returned, so no caller can hold one as the reference.
