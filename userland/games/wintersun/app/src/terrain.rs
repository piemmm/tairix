//! The ground pass: what the generated world looks like, one horizontal
//! span at a time.
//!
//! The world generator answers per *cell*; a frame is per *pixel*, and at
//! the authored zoom a cell is thirty-two of them. So the pass works on a
//! lattice of the visible cells' weight fields, interpolates it vertically
//! once per raster row, and hands each horizontal run between two lattice
//! columns to the splat, which steps the rest. That is what turns four
//! hash evaluations per pixel into four per span.
//!
//! # Nothing here reads the world
//!
//! [`TerrainGrid::rebuild`] samples a window of chunks the caller already
//! holds and a material cache the caller has already asked. A lattice
//! point whose chunk is not resident is *marked*, not fetched and not
//! waited for, and the pass draws it as ground the client cannot vouch
//! for. A paint that fetched would be the frame-loop read the charter
//! forbids, and a paint that guessed would be worse.
