//! One frame, from the ground up.
//!
//! The pass order is fixed: the terrain splat, the light and fog composite
//! over it, then the figures standing on it. The light buffer is the
//! ground's own relief shading, which is not a figure's light, so a figure
//! is drawn after it — shaded from its own surfaces, veiled by the mist at
//! its feet. Canopy, particles, weather and the overlays take their places
//! after as later items add them; the budget names them now, and the
//! renderer measures every pass rather than only the ones that do work.
//!
//! # Ask, then paint
//!
//! Everything a band needs is resolved before any band starts: the chunks
//! are already resident, the lattice is sampled, the material tiles are made
//! resident by the one mutable pass over the cache, and every figure is
//! posed and placed. The bands then only read, which is what lets them run
//! on other cores at all, and it is the same discipline that keeps a frame
//! off the filesystem: a paint reads nothing it has to wait for.
//!
//! # What a band is
//!
//! A full-width run of the target's rows. Every pass steps horizontally, so
//! a vertical cut would divide the span each is built around; the bands are
//! cut finer than the runner is wide so a core taken by another tenant holds
//! up one small piece rather than a whole share of the frame.
