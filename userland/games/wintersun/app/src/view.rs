//! The render target: how big it is, and how it is cut up for the other
//! cores.
//!
//! Two things decide the target's size. A window larger than the software
//! path can hold at its refresh is rendered at a cap and upscaled, and the
//! degradation ladder's last rung shrinks it further. Both are fractions
//! of the window rather than absolute sizes, so a change to either cannot
//! produce a target of a shape the window is not.
//!
//! # Why a band and not a square tile
//!
//! Every pass in the frame steps *horizontally*: the terrain splat walks a
//! span of pixels inside one cell row, the light composite walks a row of
//! the buffer, the resample reads a source row. A vertical cut would
//! divide the unit each of those is built around, so the piece handed to
//! another core is a full-width run of rows. That is a tile whose width
//! happens to be the target's — the bucketing a later pass does per piece
//! is unaffected — and it keeps every span whole.
