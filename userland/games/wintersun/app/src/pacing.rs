//! The simulation's clock, and how a frame reads between its ticks.
//!
//! The simulation steps at a fixed rate and the display refreshes at
//! whatever rate it has. Tying one to the other makes the sim rate a
//! visual property — motion that stutters on a 60 Hz panel and runs fast
//! on a 144 Hz one — so they are separate: the pacer converts elapsed
//! real time into whole ticks, and what is left over is the fraction a
//! frame reads *between* the last two authoritative states.
//!
//! # No drift, and no death spiral
//!
//! The accumulator counts in nanosecond-ticks rather than in nanoseconds
//! divided by a tick, so a rate that does not divide a second evenly —
//! thirty of them do not — loses nothing over an hour.
//!
//! A frame that took far longer than a tick cannot be paid back in full
//! without taking even longer, so the catch-up is bounded: time beyond
//! [`MAX_CATCHUP_NS`] is dropped rather than replayed. A client that was
//! descheduled for a second resumes rather than spending the next second
//! simulating the last one.
//!
//! # When a frame is owed
//!
//! [`Cadence`] is the display's half: frames fall due one [`FRAME_NS`] apart
//! on a fixed beat, whatever wakes the client in between, so input arriving
//! faster than the screen refreshes never draws frames nobody sees.
