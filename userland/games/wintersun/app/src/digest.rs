//! The client frame digest: the cross-target rendering claim, made over
//! a whole composited frame.
//!
//! The world generator and the simulation each carry their own
//! four-target vertical, because each does arithmetic whose identity
//! across targets is a property of the code. The ground art carries a
//! constant but no vertical: it contains no floating point at all, so
//! bit-identity follows from Rust's integer rules rather than from a
//! run.
//!
//! This is where those three meet. A frame is the generator's `f64`
//! terrain, read through the art's integer splat, lit by this crate's
//! integer shading, on four different compiler backends. That the parts
//! agree separately does not say the composition does, and the digest
//! below is the claim that it does.
//!
//! [`tairix_wintersun_art::digest::REFERENCE_DIGEST`] is folded in, so
//! this vertical is also the one that fails when the art moves — which
//! is the coverage the art crate deliberately does not carry itself.
//!
//! The frames are drawn with figures standing in them, because the figure
//! crate's own vertical proves a pose and its placement but not the client
//! drawing it: the band-by-band fill, the depth order, the veil and the
//! waterline are this crate's arithmetic.
