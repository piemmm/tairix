//! The `WinterSun.app` bundle's `Run` entry point: the game client.
//!
//! Everything with behaviour lives in the host-tested library
//! (`tairix_wintersun_app`); this binary composes it over the live window
//! channel:
//!
//! * one window, whose three size states are asked for and adopted from
//!   the compositor's answer rather than assumed;
//! * one `port_bind`-bound event mailbox the client parks on, carrying
//!   the next frame's deadline so a still window costs no spin;
//! * a worker the chunk generation is handed to, because a frame owes
//!   the window a picture and cannot wait on a realm being solved;
//! * the frame drawn straight into the window's own surface where the
//!   render scale is native, and through a resample only when the
//!   degradation ladder has shrunk the target;
//! * the player's figure: the default preset read once, before the window
//!   opens, from the bundle's own `Resources/`, and posed each frame at the
//!   moment that frame shows;
//! * the player's graphics choice, read once before the window opens and
//!   written through a worker where an interaction in the settings window
//!   settles, so no frame waits on the store;
//! * the icon-bar slot's *Settings…* row, and the settings window it opens on
//!   the same channel and event mailbox, its picture retained and repainted
//!   only where its controls report a change;
//! * `--reference-scene`: the one fixed scene (`reference`) in the same
//!   window, drawn only when its extent or its retained pixels change, so a
//!   picture of the window can be checked against the scene drawn elsewhere.
//!
//! On the host it is an inert stub so `cargo build --workspace`, clippy,
//! and fmt still cover the file.
