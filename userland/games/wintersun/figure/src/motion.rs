//! The shipped motion set: every clip a `WinterSun` figure is animated by.
//!
//! Seventeen, in three families. Locomotion — idle, walk, run — is paced by
//! the gait. Actions and the reactions to them — a dodge, the light and heavy
//! melee blows, the bow's draw and loose, a cast and its channel, a flinch
//! and a stagger — are windup, active and recovery, authored across all three
//! in phase and stretched onto time by whoever owns the action. States —
//! falling, dying, sitting, swimming, climbing — last as long as the state
//! does.
//!
//! # How the leg curves were arrived at
//!
//! Not by eye. A clip whose feet are on the floor states a **foot path** —
//! where each foot is against its hip, and how much of the leg's turn the
//! ankle levels it by — and wherever a foot is down the path is the floor,
//! wherever the clip holds the body. The hip, knee and ankle keys are that
//! path put through the planting layer's own two-bone solve and rounded to
//! six places, and this module's tests solve every key again from its path.
//!
//! The pelvis sits at a fixed height, so a clip states how deep into its own
//! legs the body stands, phase by phase, and keys its root height from that
//! depth where its legs are keyed. Between two keys the body and a planted
//! foot are then interpolated along one line, and `quality::grounding`
//! measures the two halves against each other.
//!
//! A falling, swimming or climbing figure has no floor under its feet, and
//! its legs are authored directly; `quality::penetration` holds them above
//! the floor instead.
//!
//! # One cycle, two sides
//!
//! A left and a right limb do the same thing half a turn apart in a gait, so
//! only one side of a locomotion cycle is authored and the other is that cycle
//! rotated half a turn. Two tables that must stay each other's mirror image
//! are two things to keep in step.
