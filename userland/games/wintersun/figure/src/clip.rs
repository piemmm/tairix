//! Clips: a keyed curve per parameter, the events at phases along it, and how
//! a phase advances with time.
//!
//! A clip is keyed against a *phase* in `0..=1` rather than against seconds,
//! so the same clip can be retimed by changing one number, and so a walk can
//! later be driven by distance travelled instead of by a clock without the
//! curves knowing the difference.
//!
//! No easing overshoots. That is deliberate and load-bearing: every value a
//! curve produces lies between the two keys it sits between, so a clip
//! authored inside its parameters' ranges cannot leave them, and a pose can
//! never reach a joint limit it was not allowed to. Overshoot — the snap of a
//! recoil, the settle of a follow-through — is a damped layer over the clip,
//! where it can be bounded on its own terms.
